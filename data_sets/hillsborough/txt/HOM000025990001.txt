          MR. G L A S G O W :     The p o i nt tha t I put to you, S e r g e a n t ,

And p e r h a p s it       w o u l d be fair to say that, d e s p i t e              my

A.      Of co u r se .

And    the    colours       are     righ t,    I think.        A.      Yes.

And a g a i n the f aul t           w a s m i n e for d r a w i n g y our a t t e n t i o n to

And, as I say, I a p o l o g i s e for t hat and t h a n k you for

A.        Yes, t h o s e are the t i c k e t s w h i c h we u se d on the day.

Th ank you v er y much, a nd             the c o l o u r s whic h, p e r h a p s          in

T h er e is one o t h e r m a t t e r , S e r g e a n t , w h i c h p e r h a p s you

You are, with respect,   a very substantial man? - A. Yes.

You are well over six feet? - A. Yes.

Were you knocked over or just pushed out of the way? - A.
I was pushed out of the way.

A number of people were either knocked or tripped or
fell? - A. Lost their footing, yes.

You came outside and the gate was shut and the crowd
began to build up again, summarising if I may very
briefly, the rest of your evidence? - A. Yes.

Please accept no criticism, but when the gate was about
to be opened the second time, did it occur to you that
there might be a similar headlong surge which would be
unstoppable unless a number of Officers were warned and
could take concerted action? - A. There were horses
there.

Inside? - A. Outside.   I assumed, rightly or wrongly,
that the number of people going in through that gate
would be monitored.   I expected other Officers at the
gate, and I cannot be specific as to how many there were,
to let a few through at a time and I was amazed when I
saw the video that the gate had been opened for as long
as it was open the second time.   I never realised that
that happened.

Do you mean as long, or do you mean as wide, or do you
mean both? - A. For as long, as long a period of time.

Did you also appreciate that not only was it open for
some minutes, as we have seen, but that it was flung wide
and that a whole surge could come through, as distinct
from it being opened to monitor a small number of people?
- A. I have seen that since, yes, sir.

Did you appreciate that that...   - A. I did not appreciate
it at the time, no.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    It is both the length of
time it was open and the lack of any filtering or
restraint? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Of those going through? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Whilst it was open? - A. Yes,   my Lord.

      MR. GLASGOW:   In fact, of course, Sergeant, if
those inside had been placed in the same position as you
had been placed on the first surge, it is reasonable to
                                             J. MORGAN


suppose they would have had precisely the same problem
that you had, unless they had been given time to organise
themselves? - A. Yes.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you.        Again I apologise for
misleading you yesterday.

           Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

Mr. Morgan, you have an advantage in this matter, your
experience of football matches is considerable? - A. It
is, yes.

Also the behaviour of crowds? - A. Yes.

Your observation of people in crowds waiting to take
their turn to go through entrances, waiting for whatever
it is they have come to a place for? - A. Yes.

When you answered Mr. Glasgow about the conduct of this
crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrances you were
describing something unlike that which you had ever seen
before? - A. Yes, I was.

You were speaking from that depth and extent of
experience? - A. Yes.

Is it a matter about which you are quite certain in your
own mind? - A. Yes, I am certain.

What you observed inspires you to consider that more
detailed enquiries ought to be put in hand? - A. Yes, I
would be interested to know whether there was a concerted
plan to approach the ground with the intention of forcing
our hand, if you like, making the wheel come off, and
surging into the ground.

May I ask you a little bit about what you observed in
1989 prior to that particular state having been reached?
Did you see numbers of people who, to your view, were
clearly without tickets? - A. Several people approached
me during the course of the day asking for directions to
the ticket office.   I was not aware of large numbers of
supporters without tickets standing around trying to tout
for tickets until after the lull in the situation when
the majority of the crowd had entered the ground.
Thereafter, when I rejoined my serial, I saw several
people, I would estimate in excess of 100, standing
around on the concourse and on the bridge and in front of
the sweet shop, obviously with a dejected look on their
faces as if they were resigned to missing the game.    I
only assumed that they were perhaps supporters without
t i c k et s.

                                               J. MORGAN


Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If there had been some
     concerted attempted by people like that to get in by, as
     you put it, making the wheel come off, by which I suppose
     you mean forcing the Police hand to open the gates? - A.
     Yes, my Lord.

Q. Would not you have expected them to have gone in when the
   gate opened? - A. Yes, my Lord I would, but I thought
   there might be a possibility that these people had missed
   the boat, so to speak.   They had not acted promptly
   enough or were perhaps overcome by the seething mass that
   had built up and decided not to bother.

Q. Well,   that cleared when the gates opened? - A. Yes,   it
   did.

Q.         MR. WOODWARD:    Were you aware of the evidence that
     was given earlier in this Inquiry of people hanging about
     on the bridge and then as it were abandoning their
     hanging about on the bridge and coming forward together,
     to go into the ground? - A. There were numerous people
     hanging about throughout the day and they were
     continually being dispersed by mounted Officers and foot
     Officers, in large groups, and they were reluctant to
     enter the ground.    In the past it has been the practice
     of the Police at that end of the ground when supporters
     have arrived early in large numbers and the turnstiles
     have not been opened, to shepherd them into an area where
     they could be contained.    Usually in the area behind the
     perimeter gates where they were corralled, if you like,
     until the gates opened.    It is to our disadvantage that
     crowds over the years have become wise to this practice,
     certainly Liverpool have become wise because they came to
     the last semi-final and were aware of the Police
     operations then.    They decided, obviously, in large
     numbers to stay away until the last minute to avoid the
     situation of the Police containing them and then ushering
     them into the ground at an early stage.

Q. So just as the Police become experienced so do the
   supporters? - A. Yes.

Q. They have their intelligence?   - A. Yes,    they do.




           Q. May I ask you
                                        J. MORGAN



Q. May I ask you please about the briefing and the task that
   was given to your Serial? — A. Yes.

Q. That included the instruction that "They would maintain
   order and ensure orderly queues are formed"? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that an instruction with whi&h you were familiar?
   A. Yes.
Q. And the task was something which was known to you? - A. Yes,
   I have performed that task many times.

Q. It speaks of "orderly queues to be formed"? - A. Yes.

Q. What was the practice and in the light of that instruction
   what did you ordinarily do? - A. As the number of people
   built up at the turnstiles ....

Q. Well how did you start? - A. People tended to form queues
   as a matter of course and it was then just a matter of
   walking up and down the line making sure that there wecee
   no problems and that one queue was not obstructing the path
   of another queue.

Q. As the numbers build up what happens? - A. The queues get
   linger and they have in the past extended into Leppings
   Lane up towards the bridge and down past the shops.

Q. Is that a task which requires some co-operation? - A. Yes
   it is. The queues were not two abreast, not even three
   abreast, they were sometimes four or five abreast, family
   groups and the like, groups of youths standing in a queue,
   not as I say a narrow queue but sometimes a very wide one.
   Nevertheless they were usually co-operative and orderly.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Take Turnstiles A-G, six turn­
     stiles? - A. Yes, my Lord.

 Q. You are not suggesting, are you, that there are six distinct
    queues going back all the way up? - A. No, my Lord.  The
    turnstiles are arranged in groups of two. There would be
    a queue of people, four or five people in width stretching
    back to the concourse normally.

 Q. A queue, is that what you mean? - A. A queue to each of the
    two turnstiles.  Physically a queue of people to each of the
    groups of two turnstiles.

 Q. So three queues not six.      Is thit what you mean? - A. That is
    right sir.
           MR. COLLINS:  There are seven turnstiles.     In fact
     there are three pairs and one extra.
                                  J. MORGAN


      MR. WOODWARD:  On the day in question did you have
any reason to suppose that the ordinary method of working
was not going to succeed? - A. No, I didn't. When I left
that area to take the off-duty Officer down to the gymnasium
there were not sufficient people on the concourse at that
stage to start the queues and that was, I estimate, 10-past-2.

Of course when you came back the scene was quite different?
- A. Yes, it was.

There had been a significant change? - A. Yes.

Unlike anything you have ever observed before, was it? -
A. That is right.  Had those thousands of people formed
queues the queues would have stretched back up Halifax Road
and way over Middlewood, I would imagine.

You have told the Inquiry about the time it was that you came
back to the gates? - A. Yes.

And indicated that it was, according to your recollection,
about 2.30? - A. Yes.

May it have been in fact a little later that you arrived?
- A. It may possibly have been because I have seen the video.
I appreciate that the gates were first opened at 2.48 and
I have actually seen myself leaving by Gate C.  I have also
seen myself being approached by a number of people inside
the forecourt at the rear of the West Stand who were
actually asking me to open the gates.

So knowing that the gates were opened at 2.48, does that
lead you to suppose that your recollection that you have
come back from dealing with the gentleman at 2.30, to be
perhaps wrong? - A. Perhaps five minutes later, yes.

Because it would appear from your account of what happened
between coming back to the gates and the gate being opened,
you did not in fact do very much? - A. No, I didn't.

And is this the situation:  if there had been time for
you to do things and on your timing at the moment it is
about 18 minutes or so, you would have got a lot more into
it? - A. Yes, I would.

But in fact what you did was having come back to the gate
you looked through the turnstiles, you remember observing
the situation and then being approached by a number of
people and then the gate being opened? - A. Yes.

Not an awful lot of incident? - A. Right.

Could it be that in fact not simply a difference of five
minutes from 2.30 but probably a little somewhat closer
to 2.48 that you came back? - A. Possibly but I can
                             10

                                      J. MORGAN


     remember looking at the situation for some time, looking
     at the people climbing over the walls of the turnstiles.
     I actually went to the turnstiles and climbed up and tried
     to shout to the crowd because of people being crushed up
     against the bars of the revolving turnstiles.

Q. Did you have a radio with you? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. In the time that you were back from having dealt with th®
   man to Gate C being opened, did you use your radio at all?
   * A. No, I didn't.

Q. Isn't it likely that if there was a situation that was in
   your view out of control and there had been time to do it,
   you would have been making some radio messages? - A. I would
   but the airways, the radio, Police Control can only take
   so much traffic.  Mention has been made that it would be
   preferable for all Police Officers down to P.C. rank to have
   radios.  I think the system would be swamped if that was the
   case unless we had two or three Control Boxes.

Q.    Officer, it is not a criticism of you, it is a question
     of the timing.  Do you follow? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am putting to you is this:  if there had been time
   for you to appreciate the situation and it occurred to You
   that help was needed or communication was needed, you would
   in fact have tried to do it and in fact you did not try
   to do it because time was that short? - A. Possibly so, yes.

Q. Even knowing of the difficulties that might be in the use
   of a radio, that would not have prevented you from trying
   if you wanted to and had the opportunity to do it? - A. No,
   it would not have prevented me.

Q.   But you do make a point in relation to some of the observations
     and the criticism implicit in the questions of the number o£
     Policemen, the Police Constables, that they did not all have
     radios? - A. Right.

Q. And you see from your experience a problem that attends
   "good idea"? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact is this the situation in relation to a number of
   proposals that have been implicit in certain questions,
   superficially they seem to be good ideas? - A. They do,
   yes.
 Q. But when you sit down and look at them ....    A. But
    practically not always so.

 Q. According to your experience many of them would be un­
    workable and some of them indeed counter-productive?
    - A. Yes.
 Q. In the past the Police operation, the Police planning 1988,
A
                           11

                                      J. MORGAN


    for example, it contains some form of flexibility? - A. Yes.
    It has always been flexible.   I would just like to make
    the point that over a period of many years this system has
    developed.  It has always run efficiently.   In fact I think
    that the system at Hillsborough has been the envy of many
    Forces throughout the country.   I have been aware, indeed
    Officers from the Continent have visited Hillsborough to
    look at the way that the ground has been policed, and if the
    Police operation had not been efficient then I am sure that
    the F.A. would not have considered in the first place holding
    semi-finals at that venue.

          I have heard a lot of criticism in the Press and from
    people in this room about Police Officers, and Sheffield is
    not bungle town,  Just to illustrate the point, some of
    the Inspectors and Sergeants that have been sat in this
    chair are veterans of the Miners7 Strike, the Steel Strike,
    the City riots, Toxteth, places like that.   In fact
    Inspector Builas actually trains Police Support Units.
    Those Officers acted magnificently on the day and it is
    an insult to their professional integrity, if I may say that,
    the attitude of the media immediately following the event.
    I have got nothing but admiration as well for the Officers
    who stayed behind until 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning
    dealing with the bodies, the relatives, identification.
    I had just had my bellyful at 6 o'clock and I went off duty,
    6 o'clock in the evening, but some stayed behind and dealt
    with all the many matters that were left to do. They were
    magnificent.

                                                       J. MORGAN


    Q. May I ask you a little bit, please, Officer, about what
       happened.  You spoke in answer to Mr. Glasgow of repeated
       surges forward. - A. Yes.

    Q. And that was something clearly observed in the crowd outside
       the gates - outside the turnstiles. - A. Yes.

    Q. In your statement, and of course is not intended this should
       apply to all the fans, but on a number of occasions you used
       the word "aggressive”? - A. Yes.

    Q. And on occasions you refer to people refusing to co-operate
       and fighting? - A. Yes.

    Q. For example, when you were endeavouring to get people from
       what has been called the funnel bar at the side of gate G were
       there individuals who did not want to be brought out? - A.
       There were.

    Q.   They were   fighting to stay in the throng? - A. Yes.

    Q.   They did not want to lose their place? - A. No, they      did not.
         I was amazed.

    Q. And were there individuals who were fighting to get in there
       as well? - A. Yes, there were.

    Q. So even the endeavours of the Police at that point were being
       thwarted by individuals? - A. Certainly, yes.

    Q. To be fair, and try and look at this with some calmness and
       coolness, when you speak about the fans or some of the fans
       being aggressive do you really mean that? - A. I do mean that,
       yes.

    Q.   It is not an over-statement? - A. It is not.  All of the
         fans have been painted whiter than white, and that
         certainly was not the case.  We were not approaching the
         match to deal with a riot situation.  We were approaching
         the match to deal with a sporting event, and the crowd at
         that time of the day were not sporting.

    Q. Of course, when it is put in questions or however that, "Are
       you saying this event was unpoliceable” , would this be right,
       it was not unpoliceable? - A. No, it was not.

    Q. If one had adopted particular tactics? - A. If there had been
       20 PSUs in riot gear at that end of the ground the matter
       would have been sorted, but we were not approaching the match
       as a riot.

    Q. Any system is capable of being confounded? - A. Of course it
       is.

    Q. There came a point when you said in evidence yesterday that
       you went outside and you were out at entrance C.  Were you
       talking of gate C or going outside A, C, B - do you follow -
                             13

                                                  J. MORGAN


     going through gate B to be outside C? -A. I am sorry, when I
     went o u t ....?

Q. In your evidence yesterday there was a point where you say
   that you were outside entrance C.  Do you recall? - A. That
   was initially.

Q. When you spoke about being outside entrance C, where do you
   mean? - A. Entrance C, I meant the turnstiles giving access to
   the West Stand.That was known   collectively as entrance C.

Q.   When you saw gate C opened,  the concertina gate C, that was
     opened by who? - A. The stewards, I believe.

Q. Did you see gate B opened? - A. I saw gate B opened whilst I
   was outside near the funnel bar.

Q. Did you actually see it being opened or become aware that it
   was open? You see the difference? - A. I saw perhaps the top
   half of the gate from my position above the heads of the crowd
   in front of the  turnstiles, and I saw it open.

Q.   You saw that it was open or you saw it opening? - A. I saw it
     opening.

Q. From the position you were in did you observe that the opening
   of that gate gave substantial relief to people in that area? -
   A. It certainly did, yes.

Q. So a considerable number of people must have gone in through
   it? - A. Went through that entrance.

Q. Would it be in hundreds, do you put it? - A. Yes.

Q.   Gone in through   gate B? - A. Yes.

Q.   When gate C had been opened your recollection is that it shad
     been opened on a number of occasions.   We now know from the
     video the timings and when it was and the length of time it
     was open for? - A. Yes.

Q. There came a point when you went inside? - A. Yes.

Q. When you went inside did you notice that there were really no
   Police Officers about in the concourse? - A. I did not notice
   that, no.

Q. You did not see any? - A. I just ran on to the track through
   one of the turnstiles.

Q. Then you came back again? - A. I did.

Q. Before you came back had you gone to the perimeter fence and
   stood up at it? - A. I went to the perimeter fence on the
   track and stood looking at it.  I d i d n ’t climb on to the
   hoardings to look over it.

                                                           J. MORGAN


    Q. Did you notice that not only were there Police Officers
       standing up at the fence but also fans standing up at the
       fence? - A. Yes, I did.

    Q. And amongst the endeavours of those people, the fans, not
       only to get people out but to get people in the pens to go
       back? - A. Yes.

    Q. And the fans were doing that as well? - A. Yes, they were.

    Q. Have decided to run round you went to the tunnel with other
       men.  You gathered men up and went to the tunnel? - A.
       Straight away, yes.

    Q. As you came back to go into the tunnel again is it right you
       noticed that the concourse, that area, was virtually deserted?
       - That is my impression.   I thought that it was virtually
       deserted, as you say.

    Q. So it would follow if there had been Police Officers there
       then they must have gone somewhere by the time you came round?
       -A. Yes.  I would assume that the Police Officers who were in
       that area initially at phase 1 would have taken up their phase
       2 positions, which commences at kick-off.

    Q. If all had gone according to plan? - A. Yes.

    Q. And that would have been going into the tunnel? - A. My
       serial, for instance, at phase 2 were to take up a position in
       the North tunnel.

    Q. That is not the central tunnel we are talking about. - A. No.

    Q. That is the one further to the North? - A. Yes.

    Q. What I wish to put to you is this, that by the time you had
       got to the tunnel the probability is that other Officers had
       gone in there and were already dealing with matters? - A. I
       saw three Police Officers at the back of the crowd, as I have
       already said, but I would presume because of the message that
       was transmitted by Sergeant Goddard on the radio asking for
       all available assistance on to the track, the Officers who
       were there would have made their way to the track.  I d o n ’t
       know whether that was the case o r ....

              MR. COLLINS:      That will be the evidence of the Officers
         to follow.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         What you said yesterday was that
         there were three Officers       at the back of the crowd, two
         females and one male, and       they were oblivious of what was
         going on inside.      So they   were not doing anything about it
         because they d i d n ’t know?   - A. That is right, my Lord.

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   It is curious, you see, Sergeant, a
         number of Officers have given and others may well give
         evidence, and it was their impression that their arrival was
                             15

     the first.   Do you follow? - A. In the tunnel?

Q.   Yes, and the first to be doing anything from    the tunnel? -A.
     I was the first up the tunnel.  It was quiet when I arrived
     there.  There was no-one in the tunnel.   I saw three Police
     Officers standing at the back of the crowd.

Q.   Are you able toidentify any of those Officers? - A. No, I       am
     not.  They were not known to me, and I d o n ’t think I would   be
     able to pick them out now.

Q. You made your way from the mouth of the tunnel down on to the
   terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. At the back of the terrace is it right that the crowd was not
   densely packed? - A . No, I was able to move quite freely
   forwards.  In fact, I remember one individual who I tried to
   grab hold of and throw back down the tunnel or pass back down
   the tunnel, and he pulled away from me and swayed backwards,
   and there was quite a space between me and him.   He was a bit
   hostile, that one.

Q. Were there individuals there who just did not want to go
   because they wanted to see the game? - A. Well, the game
   by that time had stopped.  There were individuals who
   wanted to stay where they were, yes.

Q. You made your way down, and I think you described having to
   fight your way down? - A. Yes.

Q. Not because it packed but because of the attitude of
   individuals, was it? - A. Some individuals.  I would assume
   that a certain number of the people on the terrace were
   already in a state of shock because of what they had seen and
   what had occurred prior to my entry.

Q.   But I think you were kicked and you were punched    and you were
     indeed spat on? -A. Yes.

Q.   As you were making your way through? - A. I was.     I had my
     epaulets torn off, my tie....

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Was this by people who knew what
     had happened or something of what had happened and were angry,
     or what, or was it just the sight of a Police Sergeant? - a. I
     d o n ’t know, my Lord.  Probably, as I have explained before,
     there was no time for niceties.     I was not easing my
     way forward.

Q. So they may have resented y o u r       - A. Rough manner.

Q ..... pushing them out of the way? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   In fact I think you are saying at the
     back of the crowd, a significant proportion seemed to be
     unaware of what had happened down at the front? - A. That is
     right.

Q. When you did get down to those who had come to grief, you were
   making your way down through pen 3 to where the victims were?
   -A. I was.

Q. It may be difficult to recall now but it might be important in
   the whole of the context of the exercise upon which we are
   engaged to know where bodies, victims, were found. - A. Yes.

Q. Have you got in front   of you the plan?

        MR. WOODWARD:    It has not been given a number or
   anything, but it has already been produced by Counsel to the
   Inquiry.  It is the consulting engineer’s drawing.    It shows
   the disposition of the crush bars.    Sir, it was in a plastic
   folder which appeared on our desk unheralded.    This  drawing
   has got ”R.B” . on it, "Ralph Braid Associates” .

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I rather doubt whether this
   exhibit is there.

        MR. COLLINS:   If Mr. Woodward wants anything more than
   the disposition of the crush barriers may I respectfully
   suggest he uses this one.  If he wants more than we will
   obviously do it.

        MR. WOODWARD:   I d o n ’t want any more.    I have quite
   enough paper as it is.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The one Mr. Collins has got it may
   be more a more convenient size, in any event.      It does show
   the barriers.      I think that is in the bundle.  Will that one
   d o , M r . Woodward?

        MR. WOODWARD:   Yes, sir.  I am obliged to my learned
   friend.  The smaller one, the more manageable one:

Q. You see there pen 3 on the left and the indication of the
   position of the barriers? - A. Yes.

Q. And then the dotted line identifies that barrier which failed?
   - A . Yes.

To    the   right     of      the    gate?       A.      Yes.

So if you w e r e to p o i n t to it on the plan, w h e r e do you

How far      b a c k out    from    the wall,            though?          A.         Right       up

                                                        J. MORGAN



    Q. So what you are saying...   I am sorry,           I thought you had
       finished. - A. I have finished now.

    Q. What you are saying, effectively, is that the instruction
       in the Operational Order to form orderly queues is one
       which in your experience is an effective instruction? -
       A. Yes.

                        By LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R ?

    Q. Have you got composite album 1? - A. Yes, my Lord.

    Q. If you would look at 25A in that. - A. Yes.

    Q. That is people waiting to go into A to G.   They look on
       there, although you can never quite tell with a
       stationary photograph, but they look fairly orderly and
       as if they are behaving themselves? - A. Fairly calm,
       yes.

    Q. However, you would hardly call that separate queues? - A.
       No, I would not.

    Q. On the other hand, I suppose by not stretching language
       too much, you could say those people were queuing in the
       sense they were... - A. Waiting patiently.

    Q.   ...waiting their turn but not in separate lines? - A.
         That is correct, my Lord.

    Q. I think what Inspector Sykes was saying was you can get
       that, a queue in the sense of a mass of people behaving
       in an orderly way and taking their turn to come up, but
       what you cannot get he was saying when you have got a
       full house, is separate lines, which if you were looking
       at a rugby match the referee would look down a line-out
       and say they were were separate? - A. That is right, my
       Lord.   In that area there obviously there are a lot more
       people to go on to the terraces in a confined area.   The
       queue situation tends to exist more at entrances A and C.

    Q. Because? - A. For some reason people tend to turn up more
       steadily for the seats.

    Q. You have got fewer turnstiles.   You have got 10,100
       people to get through these seven turnstiles? - A. Yes.
       Another thing that I might mention was that while I was
       on the concourse there was a barrier, a portable barrier,
       the 3' high type that pegs together, between the
       turnstile walls and the perimeter gate.   These
       effectively separate entrance A and entrance C.    My
       serial was to supervise turnstiles 9 to 16, but an
       official of the club, the fellow with the grey hair, came
                              24


                                               J. MORGAN


   at an early stage and moved the barrier to the right so
   that people entering at entrance A, the turnstiles to the
   north stand, were able to use turnstiles 1 to 10.
   Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for the people who were entering
   the west stand.   Two of my serial in fact were on the
   opposite of the fence to the rest of the men under my
   command.   I do not know whether that had been
   highlighted before but perhaps it helps.

Q. There are one or two things I would like to ask you.
   The remarks made afterwards criticising the Police, one
   of them was that Liverpool had been allocated the wrong
   end? - A. Yes.

Q. I quite follow, and obviously we shall have to consider
   this, the argument Mr. Woodward was putting forward that
   that could be interpreted as meaning that because
   Liverpool had been given a smaller number a lot of people
   had come in without tickets from Liverpool? - A. Yes, my
   Lord.

Q. Bearing in mind that people would not necessarily know
   the whole picture and would be perhaps speaking more
   being aggrieved than being rational, a possible
   interpretation of that was simply this, "You have stuck
   us in this very narrow end and there is that great big
   Kop at the other end and we would not have been crushed
   like this if we had been down that end"? - A. Yes, I
   accept that.

Q. Because it is a very narrow terrace this, is it not? - A.
   It is, yes.

Q. Front to back? - A. Yes.        The other end of the ground
   looks more like Anfield.

Q. One other thing which has nothing to do with what you
   have been giving evidence on directly, but we have been
   hearing evidence about what happens when an arrest has to
   be made and that it requires two Officers to go off out
   of the serial to process the prisoner, and that takes
   time? - A. Yes.

Q. I would like to ask you a bit more about that, because
   the decimation of the serials by having to arrest people
   is rather alarming.   First of all, does it really take
   half an hour?   It has been suggested to me that perhaps
   it ought only to take about eight or ten minutes to
   process somebody? - A. Yes, it does of necessity,
   unfortunately.

Q. What,   take half an hour? - A. Yes,    it does.
                                       J. MORGAN


Why is that? - A. Two Officers must escort the prisoner
for obvious reasons of security.   The procedure whereby
the prisoner is processed in the Police room, a
photograph taken of the Officer and the prisoner so that
the custody staff are aware of which Officer matches
which prisoner, and then the arresting Officer is sent
away immediately to write out a short form file.   A very
brief one, but it takes time of necessity.   There is a
further procedure then for transfer of the prisoner from
the ground to the Police Station where his identity is
verified and he is charged and bailed to court.    If the
paper - we have got a saying in the Police Force that the
job is never finished until the paperwork is done.
Unfortunately that is very much the case.

Maybe you are not the right person to ask, but is there
no way round this?    Does the processing have to be done
there and then?    Could it be postponed or delegated? -
A. I suppose it could be but Officers senior to myself
would be the ones to make that decision.    Ideally, I
would think that Officers who have made an arrest want to
be taking the prisoner down to the Police room, leaving
the prisoner there, having their photograph taken with
him and then returning to their posts, possibly
completing the paperwork later on overtime.

Yes, that is what I am wondering, whether it would be
possible to do that, or whether there is some reason why
that cannot be done? - A. I think it is possibly
financial constraints and all manner of other things.

Financial constraints? - A. The cost of the overtime, of
keeping an X number of Police Officers.

The other thing is and as a Sergeant there is no doubt
you can answer this one.   You are in charge of a serial.
Somebody has to be arrested and you are there and there
are several of your Constables.   It would not seem
appropriate that you should have to make the arrest and
go down and absent yourself from your serial for a
considerable time.   Gould that not be done by one of
your Officers? - A. If the Officer witnessed the offence
then, yes, I would assume so.

Mr. Sykes briefed my serial at the back of the stand, as
you have already heard, and told Officers to use their
judgment rather than to arrest people willy-nilly, so
that manpower wasn't depleted.   In fact on one occasion
I saw a man who was obviously drunk, too drunk to go into
the ground.   I approached Mr. Sykes and the other
Officers on the actual forecourt who were dealing with
the coach reception and things like that, I asked if they
could spare an Officer or Officers to deal with this
particular man because I did not want my serial
                                            J. MORGAN


depleting.  Perhaps there ought to be reserves held at
that end of the ground to deal with that eventuality.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you.             Do you
want to ask anything further on that.

      MR. WOODWARD:     Sir, just one matter.

       Further Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D ;

Your practical experience is that it is time-consuming to
get it done and, of course, in theory one could have a
time and motion man to say it only takes so long to fill
a form in and it takes so long to take a photograph, but
as a Sergeant with your practical experience of all your
men in all situations, is the suggestion that if the
procedure is followed it takes about half an hour,
unreasonable? - A. It is not ideal.

It may not be what you would want to happen, but in fact
that is the experience? - A. Yes.

Of course, you have got to get them to the place as well,
apart from filling... - A. Yes.   I have known situations
where personally I have arrested more than one person,
two or three on occasions, and the situation has been
intolerable really, or when I have corroborated other
Officers in their arrests.   It is very time-consuming.

Even if it is only ten minutes or so, it is still twenty
minutes of Officer time? - A. Tedious, yes.

In the match order that follows at tab 14 in the bundle,
the Operational Order, page 10, even in relation to
people who were being ejected was there a prescribed
procedure?   Paragraph 419, under the heading
’Ejections". - A. I know the ejection procedure.

The procedure says:

      "Where circumstances are such that a person is to
      be ejected from the stadium for breach of the
      ground regulations, then he will not be
      photographed etc. but will be taken to the Police
      Room where his details will be recorded on an
      "ejection slip" for entry in the Police Room
      Register, prior to ejection."

In fact was that being done to people who were ejected
from inside the turnstiles? - A. Yes, it was.   On
occasions, and again perhaps other Officers would be able
to comment, principally Inspector Calvert when he gives
his evidence, on occasions it has been the practice to
issue Officers on the turnstiles with ejection slips so
                                             J. MORGAN


that they were able to eject people and then complete the
slip and not leave their posts and hand the slips in
later.

The point is, however it is done, there is an impeding of
the Policing process and a requirement on them... - A.
There is always something that Police Officers are aware
of, that if they were to do things on their own
initiative which did not comply with the instructions and
perhaps there might later be some form of complaint, and
having not complied with the instructions would be in
jeopardy to some extent.

You cannot win either way? - A. No.

If you follow the rule and follow the book it depletes
your attention and diminishes your ability to deal with
the gate? - A. Yes.

If you do not follow it there is concern that somebody
will want to know what happened? - A. Yes.

Is there a desire that whilst of course things might be
postponed and make sure that the documentation is done at
the time, because otherwise... - A. Things go astray.
People tend to go home without filling the paperwork in
and there are prisoners left at the station without
Officers to provide the evidence to charge them and bail
them to court.

It is quite a problem? - A. It is.         It is a problem of
logistics.

       MR. WOODWARD:      Thank you.

                Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS:

There are also problems with the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act and the Codes of Conduct? - A. Yes, sir.

        MR. COLLINS:    Which we may have to look into too.
Yes,   thank you.

      MR. PHILLIPS:       Police Constable Alison Tagg
please.

           POLICE CONSTABLE ALISON TAGG C a l l e d :

                 Examined by MR. PHILLIPS

Are you Constable Alison Tagg? - A. Yes,        sir.

Were you in fact, according to the match order,          in Serial
17 on this occasion? - A. Yes, sir.

                                             A. TAGG



Q. Although in your statement I think you say you were in
   Serial 18? - A. Yes, that is right, sir.

Q. At all events you were concerned with the turnstiles
   nearest to gate A? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The first set of eight or ten turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell us where exactly you were stationed?
   Against which turnstile? - A. I was about half way along
   the semi-circle.

Q. Half   way   along from gate A? - A. Yes,   sir.

Q. Were you     with another Officer?   - A. Yes,   I was with
   PC Kirby.

Q. Did you stand either side of the - was that a double
   turnstile there? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you stand either side of that turnstile? - A. Yes, he
   stood on the far side, I stood on the near side.

Q. What did    you see your job there to be? - A. To search the
   fans  for offensive weapons, drugs, any alcohol.  Try and
   maintain an orderly queue.

Q. Did you have a receptacle to put these things in that you
   took off fans? - A. Yes, prior to the turnstiles opening
   we were given a large plastic dustbin to put the articles
   in.

Q. Where was that? - A. It was situated a little bit further
   along.   We were sharing it with another turnstile.

Q. When you first went on duty the crowd came along at a
   reasonable rate? - A. Yes, it was just a steady flow.
   We were kept busy with the searches.

Q. Were you able to search just about everybody who was
   going through? - A. More or less, yes.

Q. Did you get a lot of questions asked by the supporters
   who were coming along? - A. Yes, some people came with
   the wrong tickets and we directed them to the right
   turnstile.

Q. How was the crowd in the first place? - A. Originally
   they were mainly families and some elderly people.    They
   were quite jovial and looking forward to the match.

Q. The people who were going through your turnstile were,        of
   course, going through to the north stand? - A. Yes.
                                       A. TAGG


Did things start to change? - A. Yes.   About half past
two the crowd seemed to increase and it became more and
more difficult to search people.

Did there come a time when you had to stop doing that
altogether? - A. Yes, it would be about twenty to three.

Did you see anybody at that time, at half past two, or
just afterwards, getting in through the turnstiles
without having a ticket? - A. Yes, sir.   I saw a number
of youths, one person would go into the turnstile and
hand his ticket in and the other one would duck down
behind and go in as the turnstile opened.

What, through the same bit of turnstile? - A. They sort
of duck down behind the person who was handing the ticket
in.

How often did you see this sort of thing happening? - A.
I saw at least four or five people do that.

Did you see anybody leap over the turnstiles? - A. No, I
did not.




               Q. Was there anything you could do
                                     A. TAGG


Q. Was there anything you could do at this time to stop them
   from doing this? - A. No, because at that stage I had been
   pushed away from the turnstile so I could not actually
   get hold of the person myself and I could not get in contact
   with the people inside the ground to eject them after they
   had gone through.

Q. You were pushed away from the turnstile you say. Where did
   you end up? - A. I ended up wedged against the wall a little
   bit further along in between my turnstile and the next
   turnstile towards Gate A.

Q. So it was against the wall of the turnstile building? - A.
   Yes.

Q. How were things for you then when you ended up in this
   position? - A. I was very crushed.  I could not move.  My
   arms were down by my side and it was just a case of every
   man for himself.

Q. Were you able to breathe properly? - A. I could breathe
   in but I could not breathe out due to the pressure.

Q. Did you subsequently discover that you had suffered any
   injury or was this just the discomfort, the crush at the
   time? - A. It was just discomfort at the time but when I
   got home I had got bruising to my arms and ribs and back.

Q. What was the attitude of people who were crushing around
   you at this time? - A. They just did not seem to be bothered
   about who they were crushing, they were just intent on getting
   into the ground.

Q. Did you detect any suggestion of alcohol at this time? - A.
   Yes, not on everyone but certain individuals definitely
   had been drinking.

Q. Was there any panic amongst the crowd? - A. Yes, there was
   a woman in a white coat next to me and she became hysterical
   with the crush and I was frightened that it was going to
   spread to the rest of the crowd the hysteria.

Q. Were you able to do anything about that? - A. Just tried to
   calm her down by talking but it was very difficult because
   I was being crushed at the same time.

Q. Did you see any small children in the crowd at this time?
   - A. Yes, the small children were being passed over people's
   heads and over the turnstiles.

Q. Again could you do anythihg   to assist in that respect?
   - A. No, not at all.

Q. Do you remember some older men turning up near to you?
   - A. Yes, they turned up at the next turnstile nearest
   Gate A.

         Q. How far away from them were you? - A. About four feet.

         Q. Were you able to see their condition? - A. Yes, they were so
            drunk they could hardly stand up. A Police Officer did
            attempt to dissuade them from going in but it was to no
            avail.

         Q. And they went through then, did they? - A. I didn't actually
            see them go through because of the volume of the crowd.

         Q. What time would we put it when you were feeling the worst
            of the crush? - A. About 10-to-3.

         Q. Had things then got progressively worse from half-past-2
            onwards? - A. Yes, they had.

         Q. Were you able to communicate    with anybody else in the Police
     |      Force? - A. No, not at all.

         Q. Where was the nearest Officer to you? Where was for example
            Constable Kirby who had been with you? - A. He was pushed
            away from me on the opposite side.

         Q. So you were isolated against the wall here? - A. Yes.

         Q. Did you get out of this situation? - A. Yes, I think it was
            P.C. Kirby that managed to pull me through the turnstile
            and I got on to the other side.

         Q.    When you were pulled through did you at any stage see Gate A
              being opened? - A. I can't recall Gate A being opened at
              that stage.

         Q. Well do you recall seeing amass of people moving through
     '      that gate? - A. No, I can't remember that at all sir.

         Q.    When you were pulled out the crush outside was just as tight
              as it had been? - A. Yes, it was.   People that were coming
              through the turnstiles were complaining and shouting about
              the crush outside.

         Q. What did you do then when you were taken through the turn­
            stile? - A. As I went through the turnstile I saw Inspector
            Woodward on the other side and we all explained to him what
            it was like on that side.

         Q. Inspector Woodward? - A. Yes.  There was nothing we could
            do at that stage, we just waited for a few minutes and then
            Inspector Sykes let us back through Gate A on the other
            side.

         Q. That is the one, are you sure about that, the one nearest
            to the sweet shop? - A. Yes, that is the one sir.

         Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  What time do you think you got
              out from there? - A. As I got through the turnstile it

      was approximately 3 or 4-minutes-past-3 because I did look
      at my watch to see if the match had actually kicked—off*
      my L o r d .
Q.          MR. PHILLIPS:  3 or 4-minutes-past-3. Was your watch
      telling the right time? - A. As far as I know, yes.  It was
      3 or 4-minutes-past-3 when I got to the other side of the
      turnstile. It would probably be about 10—past-3 when we went
      through Gate A.

Q. 10-past-3.  Well when you went through Gate A again what was
   on the other side? - A. Nothing at all.  There was just a
   few stragglers, the crowd had completely vanished.

Q. And when you went through Gate A to get to the other side
   was the gate already opened or had it been specially opened
   for you? - A. It had been specially opened to let us through.

Q. So you are not aware of that gate having been opened earlier
   to let the crowd through? - A. Not personally, no.

Q. You are not aware, are you, of where that massive crush went
   to out of which you had been rescued? - A. No sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Which actual turnstile did you
      go through, do you know, to get inside? — A. I think I went
      through the turnstile that I was actually manning.

Q. Can we just see? — A. Yes, that is about right, sir.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:   Would that be 3 and 4, do you think?
      - A. Yes sir.

Q. Were you conscious when you got through the other side of
   the turnstile when you had been rescued from the crush,
   of there being a lot of people in the yard behind the turn­
   stiles? - A. Behind Turnstiles 1-8?

Q. Yes? - A. No, there were a few stragglers because I actually
   searched one or two more people before I got the call to
   go inside the ground.

Q. No, I am talking about the time when you were taken out
   of the crush that was outside the turnstiles, brought through
   a turnstile and ended up in the yard behind between the turn­
   stiles and the Stand? - A. The crowd was still there then.

Q. Was there a crowd in that area between the turnstiles and
   the Stands? - A. I would not say a "crowd" as such.  There
   were a lot of people but it was not a packed crowd.

 Q.     Did you see people going along that passageway bounded   by
       a fence towards the North Stand? - A. Yes sir.

 Q.    Did you see a lot of people or just a trickle of people?
       - A. ©aite a lot of people.

              Q. You say you went back outside and you then heard a call to
                 go to the pitch? - A. Yes, I did not actually hear a call
                 myself, it was one of the Sergeants that said we were wanted
                 inside.

              Q. Did you respond to that request? - A. Yes.

              Q. Did you go with other Officers from your Serial   tothe pitch?
                 - A. Yes, I did.

              Q. Were you still then with P.C. Kirby? - A. I followed P.C. Kirby
                 around, yes.

              Q. What was happening on the pitch when you got there? - A. We
                 came out sort of halfway down the South Stand and from there
                 it looked like it was a pitch invasion.

              Q. Were there still players on the pitch? - A. No.

              Q. You came out on the South Stand side   you say? - A. Yes.

              Q. And went across, did you then to the   terraces? - A. Yes   sir.

              Q. There were then a lot of people on the pitch, were there?
                 - A. Yes, there were sir.

              Q. Did you go up to the perimeter fence of the terraces? - A.
                 Yes, I did.

              Q. Can you say which pen or to which pen you went? - A. It
                 was Pen 3 sir.

              Q. Did you go to the area near the gate or to some other part
                 of Pen 3? - A. I went to the part where the support barrier
                 comes down to the extreme left of Pen  3.

              Q.   The extreme left of Pen 3where it isdivided from Pen      2?
                   - A. Yes.

              Q.   That the gate side of Pen 3 in fact, is itnot, the gate
                   would be to your right? - A. Yes.

              Q. Were there then Officers removing people from Pen 3? - A.
                 Yes, the gate was actually open when I went there but there
                 did not seem to be anyone actually coming through the gates.
                 There seemed to be too many people to get through the gates
                 although it was open and the people were passing bodies
                 over the fence at that time.

              Q. Did you see any Police Officers in Pen 3 at that time?
                 - A. They were just attempting to get in at that time.

              Q. Attempting to get in from where, from the pitch or from the
                 other end? - A. From the pitch.

    Q. Did you in fact with Police Constable Kirby take charge of
       a boy? - A. Yes, it was a young boy.

    Q. This was somebody that Was I think handed to you and you
       dealt with him on the pitch? - A. Yes.

    Q. And with some considerable effort he came round, I believe?
       - A. Yes, he did.

    Q. And you then stayed with this boy, did you not? - A. Yes, I
       stayed with him just in case he stopped breathing again.

    Q. Did you go with him when he was taken across tb the gymnasium?
       - A. Yes, I did.

    Q. And stay with him all the time he was there? - A. Yes, I
       stayed with him right until he went into the ambulance.

    Q. How long do you think you were with this boy? - A. Possibly
       half-an-hour.

    Q. One thing I want to ask you about: when you were there at
       the gymnasium did you go with the boy inside the actual
       building of the gymnasium or were you outside the gym. with
       him? - A. No, we were situated outside.  There was an
       ambulance parked more or less opposite the doorway of the
       gymnasium and we were sat at the back where the ambulance
       doors were open. We were not actually in the ambulance
       we were outside.

    Q. What was the boy on? - A. He was on the wood that the fans
       had taken down to carry the people across.

    Q. One of the advertising boardings? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did he remain on that until he was ready to go into the
       ambulance? - A. He was on it for a while and then someone
       else came and we took him off it because it was needed for
       other people.

    Q. When you were waiting for ambulances were there other
       casualties about where you were outside the gymnasium doors?
       - A. Yes, they were bringing bodies round to the gym.   I
       can recall one lad who was directly in front of me.   He had
       got an airway in and his friend was trying to resuscitate
       him but he was already dead.

    Q. Did something happen with regard to a doctor while you were
       waiting for an ambulance? - A. Yes, a doctor came and looked
       at the boy.  He stuck a sticker on his back saying he was
       a priority patient and he ought to go straightaway.

    Q. That is what I want to ask you about.  Can you tell us who
       that doctor was, do you know him or recognise him? - A.
       No, I have never seen him before.

          Q. He did not say who he was? - A. No, he just said he was a
             doctor.  He did not say his name.

          Q. What was on the sticker? - A. I can't remember now.

          Q. What was it, just a piece of sticky paper? - A. Yes, it was
             a small piece of white sticky paper with some writing on,
             some sort of symbol I think.  I can't recall looking at it
             closely.

          Q. And that you understood meant that the boy was a priority
             case? - A. Well the doctor said he was a priority patient.

          Q. Was he in fact then subsequently put into an ambulance? -
             A. Not straightaway, no.  It was at least 15 minutes before
             he went into an ambulance after that.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Because there was not one or
               because others were going in first, or what? - A. I think
               it was because the others were going in first, my Lord.

          Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:  Did you see ambulances from where you
               were arriving and departing? - A. No, I could not see because
               the ambulances were around the corner from the gym.

          Q. How did it come about that your particular patient was
             selected to go into an ambulance? - A. Eventually an
             Ambulanceman came up with a stretcher and put him in the
             ambulance though there was not room for him in the ambulance
             I think they put him in between the seats on a stretcher.

          Q, There were already two people in there then were there?
             - A. Yes.  There was a conscious patient that was going
             in that had just got injuries and he said:  "Oh, let him
             go first".

          Q. I think you helped to put the boy into the ambulance and
             then went back to other duties in the ground? - A. Yes, I
             did.

                     MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes,   thank you very much.

                     MR. HYTNER:  Sir, I don't want to ask the wrong
               Officer the questions.   Could I just enquire whether there
               is going to be any evidence at all called in respect of
               that which in her statement she said she heard on the
               terraces, the top of the last page of hei? statement. It
               seems to me at the moment I don't need to ask any questions
               at all.

                     MR. COLLINS:  It did not seem to us to be a material
               part  of this Inquiry, but obviously    everyone can seeit
               in the statements and can ask about     it if they wish.

                     MR. HYTNER:     It is hearsay in any event.

             MR. COLLINS: We certainly did not feel it was right
       to ask this witness because as you say it was mere hearsay
       and probably a matter which would not affect the Inquiry.

              MR. HYTNER:   I have no questions.


                       Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

     Q. Would you have before you please Soflfeh Yorkshire Police
        Document 1, the very first photograph. As I understand it
        you will see the turnstile you were working outside the
        third from the left of the turnstiles on the photograph?
        - A. Yes.

     Q. What I want to ask you about is your understanding of your
        duties as to searching and the effect it would have on the
        rate of people entering the ground.

              Did you understand that wherever possible you were
        to search for alcohol or offensive weapons or anything that
        was improperly being taken into the ground? - A. Yes, I did.

     Q. Can you further help us.  You were at Turnstile 3. Does
        that mean that you and your colleague Mr. Kirby were looking
        after Turnstiles 3 and 4 or two of you on Turnstile 3 and
        some other Officers on Turnstile 4? - A. I think looking
        at this I would say I was on Turnstile 5, the third from the
        end.

     Q. The third pair, as it were? - A. Yes.

     Q. Does that mean there was a pair of Officers to a pair of
        turnstiles? - A. Yes.

     Q. And you anticipated, did you, that you would have to search -
        and properly search because people do take terrib&e things
        into football grounds - search and take from them a number
        of items? - A. Yes.

     Q. Can you give us any estimate of the length of time it would
        take you to search properly an individual? - A. A proper
        search would take about a minute to a m i n u t e — and—a—half .

     Q. Does that mean that almost inevitably when you have got a
        group of people, let's say 12 young men arriving at 2 o'clock,
        no congestion at all, 12 people.  Can you give us any idea
        how long it would take to put those 12 through your turnstile?
        - A. I would say at least ten minutes.

     Q. Does it therefore mean that from a very very early stage
        you knew that the rate of peopife arriving was going to mean
        that you could not properly carry out your duties of
        searching them? - A. Yes.

     Q. Or did it mean that the queue would have properly to wait
        their turn? - A. It means that the queue have got to wait
        their turn.

So
                                            A. TAGG


     Q. So it was quite obvious from a time somewhere around quarter-
        past-2 that there was going to be very slow entry into the
        ground because you and your colleagues had properly to search
        for offensive weapons and the like? - A. Yes, but as the
        crowd increased the searches do become more selective.

     Q. What time did you realise that there was a build-up at the
        turnstiles properly caused, I am not suggesting they should
        not be searched, let me make it quite clear that is a very
        very important task of the Police, what time did you realise
        that that duty of the Police could well lead to crowd problems
        in the sense of-a build-up outside the turnstiles? - A. About
        20-to-3.

     Q. Not until then? - A. I was still trying to search from half-
        jp ^ t-2 .
     Q. May I ask you to look at a photograph taken at about 2.30,
        25A on Bundle 1 in Composite Album No. 1.  It is near to
        the end of the album.  I understand that 25A is 2.30.
        They are in fact not your turnstile, they are Turnstiles A-G
        but does that give some idea of the crowd around your
        turnstile at about half-past-2.  We know that was in fact
        taken at half-past-2? - A. Yes, it would be about the
        same sort of amount of people.

     Q. What I would like to ask you:  given that situation could
        you, doing your very best, properly search anyone? - A. Not
        properly search, no sir.

Q. It would mean, would not it, if you were still trying to
   search at that time it would again have the effect of slowing
   down the entry   into the ground? - A . Y e s .

          LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank   you very much:

Q. Can I just ask you, do you what happened to the boy that went
   on the ambulance? - A. As far as I know he was OK.

                POLICE SERGEANT LIONEL PROCTOR Called

                      Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

Q. Serial 19, I think, Sergeant Proctor? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

Q. And we have heard that effectively had a roving commission
   outside the gates, and we have seen its duties from the Order.
   Is that right? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Can I ask you to look at photograph 20A in the composite 1
   from South Yorkshire.  This is taken at about 25-past-2.
   There is a row of Officers in Leppings Lane, just outside.   Is
   that your serial or a different one? - A. That is a different
   serial, sir.  My serial was nearer to the ground outside the
   sweet shop in the area that leads from the turnstiles to the
   Leppings Lane road.

Q.   Can I ask you to turn on to 24A.   There are three Officers in
     the foreground of that photograph.   Are any of those your
     serial or not?   - A. Those are not my serial, but theOfficer
     facing us came   and in fact was at the perimeter gates later on
     that day with me.

Q.   Who is that Officer? - A. P.C. Scholey.

Q.   Who in fact was on Serial 18, or should have been according to
     the Operational Order? - A. I think he is in Sergeant
     Morga n's .

Q. Yes, he was.  Anyway, let me come on to what you were up to.
   What I want to ask you about in the period up to about quarter
   to half-past-2 is your experience of non-ticket holders? - A.
   I have never come across a situation like it.  Right from
   going out at 11 o'clock there were a number of fans outside.
   Amongst them were people without tickets who were asking the
   ticket holders if they had got any spare tickets.  Throughout
   the afternoon, with the help of the mounted department, we
   were sweeping them out of that area in front of the sweet shop
   and the turnstiles, up towards Catch Bar Lane, and they
   started gathering on the footpaths, over the bridge, sitting
   on the bridge, on both sides of the road, and at times I had
   to ask the mounted department to go up and clear the footpaths
   because they were preventing the people who had got tickets
   from walking down the footpaths and were having to go into the
   road.
                          39

                                               L. PROCTOR


Q. What sort of numbers are we walking about? - A. Towards 2
   o'clock I would say hundreds.  It is very difficult to assess
   numbers, but I would say hundreds.  Four or five hundred.

Q. Are these 400 or 500 different, or are they same people coming
   back again and again, or was it a combination? - A. There was
   a lot of them that came back again, but the numbers built up
   as we were sending them back, and they were obviously people
   without tickets because as the mounted department moved them
   they went on to the bridge and just amassed.

Q. How were aware that they were non-ticket holders? - A. Because
   we were asking them.   The mounted department were saying,
   "Have you got tickets?   If you have, come in.  If you haven't
   leave the area", and in fact some of them were awkward and we
   were having to sweep up after them, get them out of the area.

Q. Did you have sufficient Officers available to deal with this
   problem? - A. Yes.  I have a lot of respect for the mounted
   department who with the assistance of my serial we were
   coping.

Q. You kept a relatively static position so you could be
   available if any of your serial needed you? - A. Yes.  It is a
   position, this particular duty we have done for a number of
   matches, in fact all the season, most of us.  We were coach
   reception.

Q. What was that position you were in? - A. I was pretty central
   in that area in front of the sweet shop, in front of the
   turnstiles, the perimeter gates .

Q. So you would be not on the carriageway but in that bit the
   usher is pointing to, between the perimeter gates and Leppings
   Lane carriageway? - A. That is correct.  Every now and again
   a part of our duties was to supervise the unloading of public
   service vehicles, and every now and again one of the South
   Yorkshire Transport buses would come across the road and we
   would go across, stop the traffic, to allow them to come back
   to the ground.

Q. We know, because we have heard evidence from others that the
   pressure began to build up at the turnstiles and that by about
   2.30 the situation had got such that there was a large mass
   which could no longer be really termed an orderly queue.  Is
   that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. From what you saw what was it that led to that build up and
   the creation of that mass of people? - A. if I can go from
   quarter-past-2. I must stress that times became irrelevant,
   but I think it was quarter-past-2 when the people from the
   train came across.  I thought to myself at that time that they
   were well behaved.  They came chanting and shouting, usual
   Semi-Final atnosphere, but they seemed to go into the ground,
   we filtered them into the ground.  But after that, once we
   explained where people were to go, because as Sergeant Morgan
   has said, many, many times people came to us with tickets

                                                             L. PROCTOR


              towards the turnstiles to try and relieve the pressure.  I
              asked a few of my Officers.  By this time I had lost a number
              of my serial because of the crowd, but there would be 4 or 5
              of my Officers around.  I asked them to follow me.  When I got
              down there I finished up with two of my officers, P.C. Scholey
              and one other of my Officers, and the others had not managed
              to get down.

         Q. That was presumably because of the crush of people between
            you and the perimeter gates spilling through to the turnstile
            area? - A. That is correct.

         Q. What were you intending to do when you got to the perimeter
            gates? - A. When I got to the perimeter gates I could see that
            people were in trouble.  I was trying to stop the flow of
            people going through the perimeter gates .

         Q.   And you said I think you went to the centre gates? -A. I went
              to the centre gates.

         Q.   That is the double gates? - A. Double gates.

         Q.   And were there any Police horses there at that time? - A.
              There were some Police horses still inside the turnstile
              ar ea.

         Q. But none actually at the perimeter? -A. None at the perimeter.
            It is very difficult to say.  Yes, there were some just at the
            other side of the gate, perhaps 3 or 4 yards to the other
            side.

         Q. Was the decision to shut the gates your initiative or was it
            something you had been asked to do or what? - A. I have
            thought about this afterwards, and I think it was my own
            initiative to   shut the gate, helped by the mounted Police. We
            all seemed to have a common cause to close this gate to
            ease this pressure on the back.   If I can remark, and I put it
            in my statement, it was quite remarkable that by closing the
            gates we had created a space.   The actual act of closing the
            gate had created a couple of yards space, but the crowd were
            still pushing towards the turnstiles. We were asking them to
            come and they would not come back.

         Q. So the picture you are painting is you had initial success
            when you closed the gates in stopping the people in Leppings
            Lane pressing into the crowd within the perimeter gates? - A.
            For a few minutes.

         Q. But unfortunately those inside, instead of easing back.... -A.
            If they had come back they would have helped us to hold the
            gates.

         Q. They did not.   There was pressure from the crowd in Leppings
            Lane when you had the gates shut? - A. That is correct.   By
            this time we were on the inside of the gates, P.C. Scholey and
            myself.   P.C. Scholey had put the bolt in the base of the gate
            down.   On the other side of the gate were mounted department.

     saying, "Where do we go to?", and I am sure I will get the
     question later, if they put a turnstile letter at the top
     left-hand corner in large letters I am sure that will solve
     their problem.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      You mean A, B or C? - A. Yes,
     "Turnstile A " , and then below the gangway and the seat
     numbers.

Q.       MR. COLLINS:    You mean on the ticket itself? - A. Yes.
     I have gone off the subject now.  After the train had come in
     fans came from all around us.  They just seemed to swarm round
     us, and that is how it built up.

Q. So it was a large number arriving at about the same time that
   caused the problem? - A. After the people from the train had
   gone into the turnstiles, it was after that.  It was amazing
   where they came from.

Q. And was there anything different about the attitude of those
   arrivals in comparison with the earlier? - A. I think in my
   statement I think you will see it says in the last hour.  It
   was not the last hour.  It was the last half-hour that it
   deteriorated.

Q. In what way?   What was the cause of the deterioration? - A.
   By this time I had gone down to the double gates which are in
   the middle....

Q. We will deal with where you were, but I am just asking a
   question about what you saw of the change of attitude, if
   there was one, in the course of the last half-hour? - A. In
   the last half-hour I went down there, and that is when I
   really noticed the change.

Q. What was it you noticed? That is what I am really asking.
   What was the change? - A. There were people becoming very
   abusive, obviously had been drinking heavily, and I mean very
   abusive.  During that last half-hour there were many, many who
   would have been arrested at other matches if we had had the
   opportunity, and not only abuse but we were being pulled,
   pulled back.

Q. What was causing this as far as you could see? What was the
   reason for this abuse and behaviour? - A. I think it was
   frustration.  I think my own opinion of the event was the
   frustration of not being able to walk straight into the
   ground.

Q. And I suppose time was getting on towards kick-off by now? -
   A. That is right.

Q. You told us there came a time when you went to the perimeter
   gates? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did you find it easy to get to the perimeter gates? - A. No.
   Inspector Sykes asked me to go down to the perimeter gates or

                                                 L. PROCTOR



Q. Can you help us as to what this stage this was, and I am not
   going to ask you about times because that would be difficult.
   - A. I can relate to a time because I have seen the video
   since.  I think it was about 2.40.

Q. How many other Officers were there on the gates at this
   stage, What I am getting at, was yours the only gate closed or
   had other gates been closed? -A. I know the bottom gate was
   closed nearest to the river.  I don't know about the other
   side because by this time you are in a confined space and you
   are very much in your own environment.  You did not see what
   other people were doing.

Q.   The point being that if all had not been closed there was not
     a great deal of point in it because people would have been
     coming in through the next gates? - A. Yes.   I am sure we
     stemmed the flow so it must have been closed.

Q.   For how long did you manage to stem the flow? -   A. It is very
     difficult to say.  Two, three, four minutes.

Q. What caused the gates to open? - A. Somehow the crowd outside
   manoeuvred the horses away.  It was incredible they could
   manoeuvre the mounted department like they did.  Then the
   pressure came on the gates.  I was holding the left-hand gate,
   foot on the base of it, and eventually the crowd was such that
   I went with the gate.  I had to retreat.

Q. Was the bolt still there? -A. Both the gates came open, and it
   was only later that P.C. Scholey said, "Look, Sarge, they have
   buckled the bolt".

Q. I think you had the misfortune to be kicked by a Police horse?
   - A. Unfortunately I fell out with the Police horses at that
   time, soon after that time.

                                                 L. PROCTOR



    Q. We all have frustration. - A. That is what I am saying.
       I can understand the frustration, but not the abuse that
       came out.   Let me say the ones who were using abuse had
       had drink.   There were other people.   There were people
       caught up in it who obviously had not been drinking.    Of
       course, when we speak about abuse and that, we seem to
       attract the ones who are drunk and want to use abuse.

    Q. So the frustration may be what they felt, but it does not
       really explain their conduct? - A. It does not, no.

             MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you, Sergeant.

             MR. PHILLIPS:   Police   Constable Burnlees please

               POLICE CONSTABLE JANE BURNLEES Called:

                     Examined by MR. PHILLIPS

    Q. You are Police Constable Jane Burnlees?    - A. That is
       right.

    Q. You were serving in Serial 19 on the 15th of April? - A.
       Yes, I was.

    Q. Your Sergeant was Sergeant Proctor?   - A. That's right.

    Q. Had you previously served on match duty at Hillsborough?
       - A. Yes, on three occasions.

    Q. Had you served in this particular area before,    the
       Leppings Lane area? - A. Yes, twice.

    Q. Had you served at a semi-final before? - A. No, I had
       not.

    Q. These were just on ordinary match days? - A. That is
       right.

    Q. What did you understand your duties to be? - A. We were
       to assist the Liverpool fans to their appropriate
       turnstiles, to greet the coaches and search if
       appropriate and to maintain order at the turnstiles.

    Q. You were to be outside of the immediate area of the
       turnstiles? - A. That is right.

    Q. On the Leppings Lane side of the perimeter fence? - A.
       Yes

    Q. How far along Leppings Lane did you understand you were
       to extend? - A. We walked right up to Catchbar Lane,
       keeping the fans on to the pavement.
                              51



                                             J. BURNLEES



Q. So your patch, if I may put it like that, was between
   Catchbar Lane and the ground entrance itself? - A. That's
   right.

Q. Were you able to carry out any searches in that part of
   Leppings Lane? - A. Other members of the serial were to,
   they searched coaches and other cars that were turning
   up.

Q. What about individual fans who were walking down the road
   towards the entrance?   Was there any stopping or
   searching of them? - A. No.

Q. Was that not part of your duties as you understood it? -
   A. I understood the searching would be nearer to the
   entrance.

Q. Did you      regard it as being part of your      job to      aspeople
   if they had got tickets? - A. Yes, we did.

Q. Did you     do that on any organised basis?    That isto say,
   by stopping everybody at a particular point, or on a more
   casual basis? - A. It was more casual, but we were
   approached by far more people asking for tickets than we
   actually stopped and asked to produce tickets.

Q. People asking you for tickets? - A. If we knew where they
   could get some from.

Q. Did   you     in fact yourself stop people as     they approached
   and   ask   to see their tickets? - A. No.

Q. Before 2.30, if I can divide up the time like that, did
   you have any particular problem? - A. We were constantly
   trying to keep the fans off the road up until about 2.30.
   I have put in my statement that at about half past one it
   seemed that there was more over-crowding and that is how
   it seemed to me, that they appeared from nowhere.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Half past one you say? - A.
     I noticed them, yes.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:     Yes, that is in your statement.
     Is that in fact your   recollection that at half past one
     it was getting quite   crowded? - A. Yes.

Q. What particularly were you trying to do with these
   crowds? - A. To sort of shepherd them in but they were
   reluctant to do so and they were hanging about on the
   bridge and asking if the pubs were open and where they
   could go.   They did not take our advice to go into the
   ground.
                                       J. BURNLEES


People were milling about, do you mean? - A. They were.

Was that causing any kind of difficulty or obstruction to
those who were trying to go to the ground? - A. Yes, and
also we noticed there were large groups of thirty or
forty people, we thought they must be selling tickets and
so we caused these crowds to disperse.

Did you catch anybody selling tickets? - A. No, we did
not.

Did you see any drinking going on? -A. Yes.   A lot of
the fans were carrying cans.

What were you doing about that? -A. Just telling them
they would not get into the ground if they were seen to
be drunk.

People were carrying cans and going towards the ground.
Was there any provision for you to take the cans off
them, or anything like that? - A. Most of the people who
were drinking were not walking towards the ground.   They
were just hanging around on the bridge and at Catchbar
Lane.

What happened at 2.30 to change things? - A. There was
more severe congestion and I was half way between
Leppings Lane and Catchbar Lane when the whole crowd
seemed to split up in the centre of the road and there
was a short fight.

Tell us about that.   How many people were involved? - A.
About one hundred people.   I was in the middle of the
road and I was aware there was a mounted Policewoman
there as well.   I heard glass smashed.   I presumed it
was either bottles or glasses and cans were thrown.    As
I looked round there was a big rift in the road and fans
were just staring at the Police.

Who was fighting who?   Were fans fighting each other or
were fans fighting with the Police? -A. Fans fighting
each other.

How long did this go on for? - A. Only a couple of
minutes and then they dispersed.

Did you and your fellow Officers get engaged in breaking
this fight up? - A. Yes.   Well, nobody was arrested.
The situation seemed to ease when more Police presence
was there.

How did things progress from then on?   Did the people
who had been involved in this fight move towards the
ground? -A. I am not sure about that.
                                         J. BURNLEES


Where did you go to when this fight had been broken up? -
A. I was called to gate A just slightly afterwards.   I
had been called to help shut the gate.   It had been
opened to ease congestion.

Can you tell us about that?   That is the gate, of
course, that is alongside the wall of the sweet shop? -
A. That is right.

Who had called you to that gate? - A. I went with PC
Booth.

Was he on your serial? - A. Yes, and he had a radio.

From whom had the message come?   Your Sergeant? - A. I
think it might have been Inspector Sykes because
Inspector Sykes was at the gate and that is who we helped
to close it.

Can you give a time to this? - A. I think it was about
quarter to three.

Are you sure about that? - A. No.

Could it have been later?     Well, when you got there tell
us this:  was there a crowd   of people in front of gate A
or was it relatively empty?   - A. There was a massive
crowd in front of gate A.     We had to fight our way in.

How far was gate A open? - A. About four feet by the time
I got there.

Were people going through it? - A. Yes.   I think they
were frightened people were getting injured because they
were forcing themselves through so it was closed.

You say gate A had been opened.   You went along and
assisted in closing it? - A. That is right.

From which side did you close it? - A. From the outside.

You were pushing   it to from the outside? - A. Yes.

That would leave   you then on the outside   of gate A in a
crowd of people?   - A. Yes.

Where did you go from there? - A. I managed to push
myself against the wall and went back on to Leppings
Lane.

You were able to get along the sweet shop wall,    is that
right? - A. Yes.

Back to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
                                            J. BURNLEES


Did you see anything else happen? - A. I was standing on
the bridge and I saw people like ants scrambling over the
spiked fence that separates the ground from the river.
They were climbing over the fence on to the river bank
and over the fence again to get in.

They were going over the fence on to the river bank,
along the river bank and back over the fence? - A. Yes.

How many people did you see doing that? - A. About 40.

We did hear evidence from one or two supporters who
agreed that they had done that.    You say there were
about 40 of them? - A. I think so.

Do you remember any of the larger gates being opened to
let people in, apart from the reference you have made to
gate A? - A. I only remember seeing gate C being opened
before the match started.

Did people go through that? - A. Yes.

Were you still then by the parapet? - A. Yes.

The parapet of the bridge over the river? - A. Yes.

Did you see the ground, the entrance area, clear away
fairly quickly? - A. No, because as the crowd surged
forward I saw the Officers following so I followed as
well so I was not aware   of what was going on ahead of me.

You did not stay there, you just continued at the back of
the crowd? -A. That is right.

Into the ground.

      MR. PHILLIPS:     Thank you.

            Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

One matter, Officer.    Was it in the comparatively early
stages of the afternoon that people were approaching you
in large numbers to ask    if you could tell them where they
could get tickets? - A.    It was about half past one.

After those people had asked you, did you notice that
they went away and stood in groups? - A. No, I did not,
but they did not move away completely.   I mean, I saw
the same faces.

You were standing some little way down Leppings Lane away
from the actual collecting area, the entrance to the
turnstile area itself? - A. That is right.

     Q. Did it occur to you, or has it subsequently occurred to
        you, that those who had not got tickets would be anxious
        to see whether or not there was a systematic searching,
        including asking for tickets by Officers in the entrance
        to the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

     Q. It is obvious that if those without tickets can see or
        can experience the fact that they can get to the
        turnstiles without systematically being stopped and asked
        whether or not they have got a ticket, there is only the
        turnstile operator between them and the match? - A. There
        were more Officers directly in front of the turnstiles.

     Q. Yes, indeed, but if for some reason or in some manner
        those without tickets can discover that the Officers
        immediately in front of the turnstiles are perfectly
        properly searching for weapons and alcohol and not asking
        whether people have got tickets, that may be of
        considerable interest to groups of people who may be
        intent on entering the ground in this way? - A. Yes.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :

     Q. Had you been to many matches before? - A. Three.

     Q. This was    your fourth? - A. That is right.

     Q. Was this    the biggest match you had      ever been to?   - A.
        Yes.

     Q. So it was quite an experience for you? - A. Yes, it was.

     Q. You did not know what to expect and when it occurred you
        had no notion of whether or not it was par for the
        course, the ordinary average semi-final? - A. No, I did
        not.   I had no idea what it would be like.

     Q. In your evidence you say that after 1.30 it became very
        difficult to maintain, is that perhaps coloured somewhat
        because of your newness to this? - A. In retrospect it
        must be because nobody else has made any reference to it
        so it must be my inexperience.

     Q. Would it   be   fair to say it had been a matter of anxiety,
        as opposed to   a new experience for you?      If you had been
        worried about   it you would have mentioned it to some
        Officer? - A.   Yes.

     Q. And tried to see if this is what should be happening?             -A.
        Yes.

     Q. However,   that did not happen?      - A. No.

                   SERGEANT PHILIP SIDNEY SMITH Called

                        Examined by MR. COLLINS:

    Q. Sergeant, your full names please? - A. Philip Sidney Smith.

    Q. You are in fact a Merseyside Officer.   Is that right? -
       A. That is correct, sir.

    Q. And were one of the mounted Officers seconded to assist at
       the semi-final at Hillsborough? - A. That is correct.

    Q. You were posted to the Leppings Lane, that is the Liverpool
       end? - A. Yes.

    Q. How many of you were there from Liverpool.  Can you remember?
       - A. There were ten mounted Officers altogether from
       Liverpool.

    Q. That would be what one Inspector, yourself and eight Officers?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. You have I think some seven years, is it, experience of
       mounted duties? - A. As a mounted Officer.

    Q. You have attended have you in the course of that a number
       of football matches? - A. About 300 over those seven years.

    Q. And presumably you are very familiar with policing at
       Anfield? - A. I am indeed, yes sir.

    Q. Dealing with Liverpool supporters generally? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. Because I imagine you are used when Liverpool and perhaps
       Everton as well go outside? - A. Every week at either
       ground.

    Q. And are you experienced also with dealing with numbers of
       Liverpool fans of the sort of size that we are concerned
       with here? - A. Yes sir.  The average attendance over the
       last couple of seasons at Anfield has been between 38,000
       and 40,000 people.

    Q. Obviously there may have been individual problems but have
       you had or do you have the sort of crushing problems ever
       that we experienced or you experienced at Hillsborough in
       the course of your policing at Anfield say? - A. I have
       never experienced it in the seven years I have been there.

    Q. I suppose one of the major distinctions here between what
       you have at other grounds and Hillsborough is the bottleneck
       effect of Leppings Lane entrance? - A. That is correct,
       sir.

    Q. Were you or did you think that that could cause possible
                              58

                                        P.S. SMITH


      problems? - A. I don't think it is a good design to have
      static barriers in an area where you are going to use
      horses to police.

Q. Why is that? - A. Because to police people with horses you
   need space to move the people into and by having static
   barriers you remove that space.

Q. Now the area within the perimeter gates and the turnstiles,
   that concourse as I think it has been described in some
   quarters, is a relatively small area, is it not? - A. It
   is sir, yes.

Q. It is also sub-divided, as we can see, by a fence between
   1-16 and A-G and a half fence or barrier sticking out at
   the edge of A-G? - A. That is right sir.

q .   j n your view does that cause problems for use of horses? —
      A. It certainly does not help. As I say you need space
      at the sides of a crowd of people if you are going to
      police them with horses to move them.   If you have got
      a barrier at the side of people the people have got nowhere
      to move other than forwards and backwards and they are very
      reluctant to move forwards or backwards whereas they will
      move s ideway s .

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You are talking when you say
      "barriers", not a good design to have static barriers.   You
      are not talking about the perimeter gates? - A. Yes sir,
      wrought-iron fence, anything like that.

Q.    You are.  That is forwards and backwards movement?   - A.   I
      am talking of the sideways movement now, sir.

Q. You are talking, are you, about the dividing wall there and
   the barrier at the other side? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.    But you are not talking about the perimeter gates and their
      railings there, are you? - A. No, not those sir.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I follow.

q .         MR. COLLINS:  What was your understanding of your
      role. Assuming all had gone as it should have done, what
      would you anticipate that you would have been doing? - A.
      My brief was to assist with the entrance of the Liverpool
      fans into the turnstiles at Leppings Lane along with the
      other Officers that were detailed for that particular point.

 Q. But where and how would you be controlling those fans in
    order to assist with their getting in? - A. Having worked
    there once before, I worked there at Hillsborough in
    January 1988 on the occasion of another football match
    between Everton and Sheffield Wednesday, I would have anti­
    cipated to have spent ray time outside the wrought-iron gates
    easing the people in through the wrought-iron gates up to
    the turnstiles.

And what, creating some sort of barrier to people s o t h a t
they did not flood in in too great numbers? - A. Correct,
yes sir.
In the earlier stages between 1 and 2 o'clock a f£kough I
think there were quite considerable numbers, nothing 1J-^e
the large numbers that came later? - A. No, there were
lot of people about in the area but the people        into
the ground was just a steady flow, no problem at all.

About 2 o'clock did you begin to make an effort to get people
tb move out of the rSadway and actually go into the ground?
- a . Yes, there were a lot of people on Leppings Lane,
particularly on the bridge and the problem that was being
created was that they were blocking the footpath thereby
causing people to walk into the roadway and as traffic was
still using Leppings Lane it was becoming quite hazardous,
so we made a conceited effort to d e a r 5the ^ p a t h s a n d
to encourage people to go into the ground if they had tickets
and if they did not have tickets to go away.

 What was your view of the numbers who were there without
 tickets? - A. It is very difficult to tell with football
 fans whether they do have a ticket or not ^ c a u s e :^ L u a h
 them if they have a ticket and they look at you as thoug
 you have spoken to them in a foreign language very often,
 but from my experience of similar games where w e have had
 all ticket matches at Anfield and Goodison with crowds of
 45,000/46,000C people, I would estimate no more than *
 to 300 at the most would turn up at a game like that without
 tickets.
. Did anything that you see lead you to form an opinion that
  this was out of the ordinary so far as non-ticket holders
  were concerned? - A. No sir.

. And that of course is your experience and very
  experience with dealing with Liverpool supporters? - A. Yes
  sir.
. We know a train load arrived shortly after 2. You remember
  that, do you? - A. Approximately 2.15 they arrived at
  the ground.
  That all went well and it was after that that the crush
* began to build up? - A. It started building up r o u n d about
  2.30.  The people off the train arrived and went into the
  ground without any problem singing.
        LOXD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The last witness talked about_
* "filtering" them in. How did they enter into this perimeter
  area? - A. I don't understand what they meant by filtering
  What we did we had our horses outside the wrought-iron
  gates spread   across the concourse aacea to filter th
  people between the horses. WQ^k ^ o t of requests,
                                   P.S. SMITH


been pointed out I understand on a number of occasions
regarding which turnstiles.  There seemed to be an awful
lot of confusion.  People had tickets with a certain letter
on and the turnstiles weren't marked with that letter.
I spent a lot of time between 2 and 2.30 answering queries
as to where people should go with tickets, but there was
still no problem.  Up until 2.30 people were still entering
the ground without any problem.

® a t CwasJ J?,: so far as you could tell that created this
problem and produced the crushing? - A. One of the things
that I did notice was that people were slow going into
the ground.
You mean the turnstiles did not seem to be operating ••••
A. To the turnstiles.   Having done a number of all ticket
matches, most of the games we do at Anfield and Goodison
people have to pay and that slows it up because the turn­
stile operator has to give change, but on an all ticket
match you expect people to go into the ground quicker than
if they are paying money, but in fact on this day they
were going through a lot slower than I have ever seen
people who are going through who are paying cash.   I
don't know the reason for that.   I did see some people
being searched.   Again not everybody was being searched
and I don't know what South Yorkshire Police's policy
 is but in Liverpool the searches are random, in other
words the Officer himself decides whether the person who
 is going into the ground is worthy of a search. In other
words you would not search a 60 year old lady going in in
 a wheelchair.
You would not search Mr. Hytner but you might search some­
one else? - A. No, but someone who you may think is worthy
of a search would be searched and that was the impression
I got was going on on this day.  I did not see everybody
being searched going into the ground.

It would be impossible to search everybody? - A. Yes, but
people were being searched and the turnstiles were very
slow.
That is one factor,   the slowness of the turnstiles. What
What else from what   you saw? - A. From 2.30 onwards the
build-up became quite big and one of the other major factors
was that a lot of the fans seemed to come towards the ground
from the direction,   the opposite direction from which we
had been told to expect them.

 You mean from the direction over the bridge? - A. Yes, we
 had been told that the bulk of the Liverpool fans would
 come from the Halifax Road direction along Leppings Lane
 but in fact vast numbers of them came over that railway
 bridge from the opposite direction.
                                      P.S. SMITH


Q. You mean the river   bridge? - A. The river bridge, sir.

Q. Does that mean that the policing was geared rather more to
   controlling them coming down Leppings Lane than to con­
   trolling them coming over the bridge? - A. I cannot really
   comment on that.  Having walked;round the ground earlier
   on from 12 o'clock onwards, there were Police Officers
   all around the ground and it is only supposition, but I
   would surmise that the South Yorkshire Police themselves
   would have been expecting the Liverpool fans to come from
   Halifax Road.

Q. As this crush began to develop and one got the mass of people
   inside the perimeter gates, what was the attitude of the
   fans? - A. At first it was a happy atmosphere, what I have
   described in my report as a "carnival atmosphere".  There
   was a lot of singing, a lot of shouting, chanting, which
   you get at all football matches.  There were people who had
   been drinking but there was no disorder from these people
   at that time.

Q. What steps were taken to try to sort out this crush? - A.
   When the crush started to develop in front of the terracing
   turnstiles.  I am not sure of the numbers or letters, all
   I know is the terrace West Stand and North Stand.

Q. It is A-G in fact. - A. I sent two of my Officers,
   Constable Grummill and Stanbridge into the crowd.  They
   had the two best Police horses there on the day and asked
   them to start forming the crowd into some order, which in
   fact they did.

Q. They from what you told us earlier would perhaps have had
   some difficulty because of the confined area in which they
   were working? - A. Yes, their task was not made easy by
   the metal wall on one side and the barrier on the other side
   but they did manage to get some order and get the crowd into
   an orderly queue to start with.

Q. Were people still coming down? - A. Yes and filtering towards
   the ground.

Q. So was any move made to try to stop more people going into
   the turnstile area? - A. When the crushing eventually
   built up to such a stage that it was obvious that something
   had to be done, a line of horses was put across the front
   of the wrought-iron gates on the outside.  I can't be sure
   how many, I would say it was either nine or ten horses
   approximately.  The horses were put nose to tail across
   to form a barrier to stop anybody else joining the crush.
   At that time the wrought-iron gates at the entrance to the
   confined area were closed.

Q. That is the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.
&                                                               62


                                                                                             P.S. SMITH


             Q. Did that succeed? - A. It did and in fact a gap appeared
                between the gates and the back of the crush at the turnstiles
                of some 10 feet and despite the pleadings and requests from
                the Police Officers in there, mounted and footmen, the crowd
                would not move back into this space.  Had they done so it
                would have relived the crushing by the turnstiles and made
                entry into the turnstiles easier.

             Q. Any views as to why the crowd would not move back or did
                not move back? - A. It is just general football fan behaviour.
                It is a thing I have experienced on many occasions that they
                will not move backwards.  Their sole intent is to get into
                the ground and they feel that if they move backwards they
                have lost their place in the queue.

             Q. Is that something which surprises you although it was
                obviously unfortunate to say the least? - A. It surprised
                me a little because of the crush that was going on at the
                front was more severe than I have ever seen before, but
                it does not surprise me that they are reluctant to move back.

             Q. By this time had your Officers got out of the crush or were
                they still there? - A. No, they were in there trying to
                get them to move backwards.

             Q. What about holding the line at the perimeter gate? - A. The
                line held for some time.  I honestly cannot say how long.
                Then I noticed that one horse in the line had obviously
                become agitated because of the problems surrounding him and
                the horse had moved out of his position.

             Q. There was effectively another crush, the head of which was
                at the perimeter gates by this time.  Is that right? -
                A. There were a crowd of people on the outside of the horses
                towards Leppings Lane itself.  The rest of the people at
                that time were more or less inside the confined area but
                within the perimeter gates.

             Q. With the gap you have told us about between the two? - A.
                Then one of the horses moved his position out of the line
                which left a gap of about 10 feet and the crowd surged
                through.  They forced the wrought-iron gates open and
                charged into the back of the people who were then at the
                turnstiles.  There was nowhere for them to go other than
                into the back of those people, but they surged forward
                anyway.

             Q. You say "charged".   That is a fairly dramatic word? - A.
                Surged, I would say.




                                                                       / Q . Were they running ....

Q. Were they running? - A. Some were running, yes.

Q. Others walking at a fast speed? - A. Yes.

Q. Again, what was the attitude of those who came in the way you
   described? - A. By this time it had changed.  The carnival
   atmosphere had disappeared.  There was obviously frustration
   from these people because they sensed they were not going to
   get into the ground before the game started, and there was a
   little bit of hostility starting up at this stage.

Q. Towards you as well as the others? - A. Towards myself.
   Towards other Police Officers.

Q. Was it appreciated you were a Merseyside Officer? - A. I was
   recognised as a Merseyside Officer by some people in the
   crowd, y e s .

Q. We know at some stage shortly after all this some of the
   concertina gates were opened.  I am putting it in that way
   because there is some possible confusion about when individual
   gates opened. - A. Yes.

Q. Were you aware of any gates being opened? - A. I saw gate A
   open.

Q. That is the one on the left-hand side as you are looking at
   the turnstiles? - A. Giving access to the North Stand.

Q. You saw that being opened, and that presumably relieved to
   some extent the pressure? - A. I did not actually see it being
   opened.  I looked across and saw it was open, and it was open
   at that point about 3 or 4 feet.  I naturally thought that the
   gate had actually been forced by the fans.

Q. As a matter of interest, can you help as to how long that was
   after the surge you have described when the perimeter gates
   were opened? - A. I would say somewhere in the region of 5 to
   10 minutes.  I c a n ’t be exact.

Q. I think you were also aware at about this time that the crowd
   on the other side had dissipated? - A. What happened was I saw
   the gate open.  I saw that the gate was open, and I presumed
   it had been forced by the fans, so I made my way across with
   my horse, pushed my horse through the crowd, in an effort to
   block the gate off and stop anybody else going in.   When I
   actually arrived at the gate I realised it had been
   deliberately opened and that there were Police Officers
   marshalling the people through.  I then moved away, brought my
   horse back to where I had been, and when I arrived back the
   crowd that had been in front of turnstiles A-G had gone, and I
   was not aware of where they had gone.

Q. I think you later - you stayed roughly where you were     -but
   later were aware of the arrival of ambulances? - A. I saw
   ambulances arriving at what I now know to be gate C.

          Q.   Did you have a radio? - A. I did.

          Q.   Did all your Officers have   a radio? - A. All my Officers had a
               radio.

          Q. Did you hear any relevant messages over your radio at any
             stage? - A. During the last 45 minutes, quarter-past-2 to 3
             o'clock I heard very little.  The helsets that we wear as
             mounted Police Officers are what as known as a NATO helmet
             which is for use in public order situations. It is not easy
             to hear with one of those on, and because of that and the
             crowd noise I heard very little on the radio.  The only radio
             message I can in fact recall hearing was a request for all
             footmen outside the ground to go inside the ground, but that
             was well after kick-off.

          Q. Again, you are very familiar with Anfield crowds and Liverpool
             supporters.  Was there any difference at any stage that you
             were aware of between the attitude of this particular crowd
             and the general expectation of Liverpool supporters? - A. Yes,
             I have never known such hostility by a crowd of Liverpool
             supporters at a football match.  I have never experienced them
             behaving like that at either Liverpool or Goodison, the two
             grounds I have policed.

          Q. At what stage are you talking about? - A. In the last 20
             minutes I would say.

          Q. There has been a suggestion of a very considerable amount of
             alcohol consumed, indeed evidence of a very considerable
             amount of alcohol consumed.  Were people as far as you could
             see more affected by drink than normal? - A. I would say so on
             this occasion.  I toured the area from 12 o ’clock onwards, and
             I have not seen in my experience that amount of drinking going
             on in the streets prior to a football match.   I speak now not
             only from my experience of Liverpool.  I have been to football
             matches in Manchester, Birmingham and London, and I have not
             seen that amount of drinking going on in the streets prior to
             a game.

          Q. Having said that were you aware of any particular drunks or
             people who were very badly affected by drink? - A. No, I never
             saw anyone who I would say was a legless d r u n k , but there were
             people who were obviously affected by drink.      But a person who
             is happily drunk can very soon become a person who is
             violently drunk.

          Q. And the situation was such, as I understand it, there were a
             lot who as far as you were concerned were apparently drunk in
             that sense? - A. In the last 20 minutes.

                                 Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

          Q. Can I just ask you.  What was your reading for the cause for
             the excessive drinking? After all, you have policed Liverpool
             supporters many times.  Presumably their drinking capacity and
             habits could hardly change for a day unless there was some
                          65

  other factor.   Was it a very warm day? - A. It was a very hot
  day, sir.

Q. Was that a factor, do you think? - A. I think that would have
   an effect.  The occasion itself, a Semi-Final.

Q. You had not been there are the previous Semi-Final the year
   before? - A. No, sir, but I had assisted at Hillsborough in
   January, 1988, at an FA Cup match.

Q. A January day might not be quite as attractive, sitting out on
   a wall drinking? - A. It would have been a lot colder.   I
   think the weather and just the atmosphere itself, but at 12
   o ’clock when I arrived there there were people out in the
   streets drinking, three hours before the kick-off.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. HYTNER:

Q. Could you just look at the model, Sergeant Smith.  There may
   be all sorts of other reasons why these barriers are there,
   and obviously I am not going to ask you about that, but purely
   from a policing point of view, if the barrier between the two
   sets of turnstiles had been removed, the radial fence on the
   outer side removed and a safety gate to prevent access by
   Liverpool fans round the South Stand had been put in way down
   the river road where the usher is pointing, so you have a gate
   that can be closed off down there, if that had been the
   position, even with the limited space between the turnstiles
   and Leppings Lane, you would never get so bad a crush that it
   would not have a safety valve round the corner? - A. No, if
   the barriers were removed it would obviously make the
   situation a lot easier.

Q. The Police horses alone could have controlled any bad crushing
   at those turnstiles? - A. It would have made our job a lot
   easier, yes, sir.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. JACKSON:

Q. May I deal with your experience at Anfield and the rate at
   which the crowd gets on to the Kop.  Would I be right in
   saying that anyone who is familiar with Anfield could quite
   confidently expect to arrive something like 20 minutes before
   the match and get on to the Kop? - A. It would depend on the
   price of admission.  This season possibly, because of the
   price of admission.

Q. So it would be in the minds of people who were used to
   attending the matches at Anfield - I use the term 20 minutes;
   not half-an-hour or three-quarters-of-an-hour,• 20 minutes
   before - would expect to get on to the Kop? - A. Certainly if
   they had a ticket, yes, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. May I ask you about the barriers that you have just helped Mr.
   Hytner with.  Do I understand you to say that if the situation




                                                                    -.a.-

   is kept under control at that corner of the ground there
   should ideally never be circumstances in which horses have to
   operate within the confining area? - A. No, if the people
   themselves behave in an orderly manner then there should never
   be any reason for the horses to go in there.

Q. You d o n ’t like the idea of having the horses operating in an
   area where there are fixed barriers at all? - A, No, sir, it
   is not an ideal situation to put a horse into because you have
   barriers either side* and you cannot move the people with the
   horse.     If there is nowhere for the person to move you cannot
   move them.     It is as simple as that.

Q. And you certainly never intended that your horses should be
   deployed inside that area when you arrived there that morning?
   - A. That is not for me to say, sir, because I am not the man
   responsible for policing the outside of the groUnd.   I was
   acting under the instructions of the Inspector from the South
   Yorkshire Police.

Q. Forgive me, I did not want to invite disloyalty, but you did
   say yourself you would have expected to stay outside the
   gates? t A. Yes.  That is based on my experience from working
   there last year.

Q. I have equal respect for that if I may say so,but your own
   personal expectation was to remain outside the gates? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And if those gates are used from the outset either with or
   without the assistance of Police horses so as to control the
   flow into the turnstile area at whatever rate the turnstiles
   prove to be able to consume, there should never be a situation
   in which a dangerous crush arises within the confining
   barriers of the turnstile area, should there? - A. I am afraid
   I c a n ’t see what you are getting at there, sir. There is
   nothing to stop people walking into that turnstile area.

Q. As we can see on the model if in fact the perimeter gates are
   used either with or without the assistance of Police horses if
   necessary so as to control the rate at which people are
   allowed to pass into the turnstile area, you ought to be able
   to control the situation so that danger and crushing does not
   arise at turnstiles? - A. The gates are not used to control
   people to come in.  The gates are left open and people just
   walk through them into the turnstile area.

Q. What happened on this occasion, and it may be we can see it is
   different from previous years, the gates were not used in that
   they were not forced shut until it was too late.  Did that
   occur to you? - A. I would not say it was too late when those
   gates were shut because the crushing that was inside was bad
   but not severe.

Q. But the situation was out of control in that you were already
   anticipating sending horses into an area, and indeed you
   personally did send horses into an area where you on your own

                expectation would not have expected them to go.  It was only
                then that anybody on this year thought of closing the
                perimeter gates?  Is not that right as a matter of fact? - A.
                I sent the horses in there because the crushing was becoming
                bad.  It was not critical.   It was not severe. It was
                becoming bad.  I sent the horses in to sort that little
                problem, out which was done very qu i c k .

           Q. Sergeant, I am not suggesting it is your fault, but it is a
              matter of fact, is it not, that if the perimeter gates had
              been used to control the rate at which people were allowed to
              enter into that area no crushing could have developed in the
              first place? - A. I find it difficult to believe, sir, how you
              would expect to use those gates to stop people going in.

           Q. Leave your expectation.... -A. If you shut the gates they will
              only force them open.

           Q.   You saw them      forced        on this occasion? - A. I did, indeed.

           Q.   Because they had been forced against a crowd who had seen them
                open for quite a long time, and indeed if you are right, no
                attempt was made to control them until the ferocity and force
                of the crowd was such that they were capable of bending the
                steel bars on the gat es . Is that right? - A . N o , that is not
                right, sir.   We were attempting all the time to control the
                crowd.  We did not leave it until it got out of hand and then
                try to control it.

           Q. Sergeant, that may be the rub.  Was any attempt made to
              control those gates and to close those gates before it was
              almost physically impossible to do so? - A. I c a n ’t say that,
              sir, because I was not outside that set of gates all the time.

           Q. Did you see anybody, mounted or otherwise, attempting to close
              those gates before it proved to be almost a physical
              impossibility to do so? - A. No, I did not, sir, because as I
              say i was not stationed outside those gates all the time.    I
              was moving up and down that area, moving on to the railway
              bridge and then back again.  I was not outside that set of
              gates permanently.  Therefore I c a n ’t say whether anybody
              tried to shut them on another occasion or not.

           Q. And you appreciate, Sergeant, there is no criticism from me
              for you doing so, but the fact remains that if those gates had
              been controlled and closed, all but a limited space, with the
              use of horses if necessary from the outset, it would have been
              physically impossible for a crush to develop in the confining
              area of the turnstiles inside? - A. It may well have helped.

           Q. And all that would have happened would have been that the
              crush or crowd within the Leppings Lane area itself would have
              necessitated the closing of that road? - A. Of Leppings Lane?

           Q. Yes? - A. Possibly, yes.

           Q. And I appreciate,    let it be s a i d r that no-one would have

                                               P.S. SMITH


   wanted Leppings Lane to be closed.  I am sure part of your
   objective was to try and control that crowd in a way that
   enabled the highway to remain open.  Would that be right? - A.
   I would say so, yes.

Q. But were you also aware of the fact that the Officer in
   command of that area had decided that Leppings Lane had to be
   closed even before 20-past-2? - A. No, I knew nothing of that.
   As far as I was aware Leppings Lane was open all the time.  I
   heard nothing regarding the closing of it, and I cannot recall
   seeing the road was closed inasmuch there was no traffic on
   it.  I was not aware of it at all.

Q. If it be right that the decision had been made by the
   commanding Officer that Leppings Lane had got to be closed and
   that that decision was made before 20-past-2, at that stage at
   the latest there could have been no conceivable reason for
   leaving the perimeter gates open, could there? - A. I c a n ’t
   really comment because I d o n ’t know that an order was given.
   I know nothing about the closing of Leppings Lane.

Q. I appreciate it is difficult to follow something put on a
   hypothesis, but if you would accept it from us and
   specifically from me that the commanding officer did want that
   highway closed - talking in round figures - from approximately
   20-past-2, can you think of any reason why 20 minutes or half-
   an-hour passed before anybody thought of trying to control the
   crowd by closing the perimeter gates? - A. At 20-past-2 there
   was no problem with the crowd.

Q. Precisely, and the gates could have been closed, although
   the build up would have trespassed on to the highway, once
   the decision to close the highway had been made was there
   any conceivable reason for not closing the perimeter
   gates, with the use of horses if necessary? - A. If we had
   closed those perimeter gates with the people on the
   outside then the problem would have been outside.   They
   would have forced the gates, as they did do.   From my
   experience they would have forced those gates.   They were
   intent solely on getting into the ground and would not
   listen to reason from myself or anyone else.

Q. Are you really saying that the level of force and aggression
   was such at 20-past-2 that you believed the crowd would have
   behaved in the same way as they did when the gates were forced
   closed again them? - A. No, not at 20-past-2, sir, but at 20-
   past-2 there was no point in closing those wrought iron gates
   because there was no problem at 20-past-2.

Q. And no anticipation that the situation might get out of
   control so far as you are aware? - A. Not at 20-past-2, no,
   sir.

Q. And so far as you are aware nobody gave any thought to the
   possibility that although the road needed to be closed this
   was a situation that might get out of control? - A. I can't
   comment on that because I did not know somebody had realised

  that it was bad the road needed to be closed.  At 20-past-2
  it was no great problem, any worse than I have ever
  encountered before.

                     Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. One question arising out of that.  You did say before, "I had
   expected to work outside the perimeter gates so that the fans
   did not flood in in too great numbers"? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So that rather suggested to me, whether the perimeter gates
   were open or shut, you were aiming to let only a flow go
   through them that was not excessive? - A. yes, sir.  The
   perimeter gates are narrower than the area in which the people
   are going into, and if you don't monitor the people going
   through the perimeter gates they will crush on those gates.
   So the idea was to make sure that people were allowed through
   the perimeter gates in safety and then up to the turnstiles.

Q. The question really which arises out of what was being
   asked is whether if the horses had been used in that way
   before a crush developed inside the turnstile area, you
   would have been able to prevent it from getting to the
   stage where people were getting panicky and desperate at
   the front and people behind would just have been filtered
   through? - A. I think the problem was although we monitored
   the people going through the perimeter gate into the
   turnstile area it became a steady flow going through there,
   but they were then slowed up because of the slowness of
   going through the turnstiles, and that created a build up
   inside that area.

Q. The question is whether when you saw that slowing up, slowed
   up the filter through of people from behind? - A. We did
   endeavour to do that but by that time it got to half-past-2
   and we were met with this sudden surge of a very large crowd
   of people who pushed their way in.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Very well.   5-past-2.
