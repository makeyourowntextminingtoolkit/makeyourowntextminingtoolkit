             At     2.10pm         (1410)            I had          cause       to    arrest          a Nottingham                Forest          supporter

              for    attempting                 to     enter          the      ground       whilst          drunk.           As    is       custom       he     was

              conveyed            to    the       po 1 i ce         ra o m , d o c u m e n t e d       and       detained.              1 was       then

              informed            to    complete             my       report         in    the       gymnasium          prior          to    returning              to

              my    serial.             As      I entered                the    gym       other       serials          were       mealing          and    other

              individuals               were         completing                paperwork.             I would          estimate             some    40    to        5(J

              officers            in    the       gym       at      this       time.           I did       not    have       a    radio       with       me     and

              I was      unaware             of      any     other            officers          in    the    immediate             vicinity          who        had

              one      either.              There         was       no    indication             of    anything             happening             that    was

              that      person          was       as      I never             saw    the       face    behind          the       voice,       words       to

              the      effect          that       officers               in    the    gym       may    be    required             as    trouble          was

              brewing.

              Some      two       or    three          minutes            later       another          shout,          again       unidentified                 and

              unable         to    say       if      it     was       the      same       voice       as    before,          that       all       officers

              Together            with       many         other          officers          I    left       the    gym       and    went       into       t he

              playing         arena          and       as       I    looked         towards          the    Leppings             Lane       end    I saw        a

              multitude            of       persons             clambering            over       fences          and    up       the    rear       wall       to

              grass       I am         unable          to       say      but    both       teams       were       leaving          the       pitch       and        a

number       of    Forest           players         were           kicking            a    ball       about       in       the     Kop     halt       of

the    ground.

As    I approached                the     half         way       line       I was          still          convinced           that       an

invasion          of    the       pitch      was        about          to       happen.

It    was    only       as     I neared            the       goal          line       of    that          end    that        I saw        that    a

major       problem          was     evident.                I was          approached                by    one       Liverpool

supporter          who       shouted          that          I was          a murdering                bastard,             that     there        were

people       dying       in       the     pens         and       that       I should                get    in a n d        get     them       out.

In    front       of    rne I s a w          vast       numbers             of       Police          officers          climbing            up    the

fences       from       the       outside          and       greater             numbers             of    supporters              climbing

from       the    inside.            On      the       pitch          shouting             screaming             and       hurling         abuse

at    the    police          a p p a r e n 1 1y        hundred s            of       L i v e r p o o 1 s u p po r t e r s .           I

a p pr o a ch e d a n        ope n      gate       to       th e      r igh t        of    t h e goal           and    assessed            the

situation.

Officers          were       trying          to    get       in       but       were       forced          back       by     supporters

getting          out    or    at     least         trying             to    get        out.          I was       aware        at    this        time

of    the    smell       of       vomit       and       beer.              The       scene          was    total        confused            chaos.

Going       towards          the     gate         I saw          on    the        grass         a    male       aged       about     23,

weighing          some       14     stone,         totally             blue          and    lifeless,             officers           were

trying       to    revive           him      but       he    appeared                dead.

Again       I was       challenged                by    Liverpool                 supporters               to    get       into     t he      crowd

and     clo s o m e t h i n g       but      I was           unable             to    get       any       closer       to     the    fence than

the     running          track.           The feraty               of       the      abuse          I was       receiving                m a d e me

fear       for    my    safety          as    well          as     that         of     others         around          me.

After       a moment           or    two      I eventually                   found          myself         at     the       open         gate and

 th e    Liverpool              fans        were       very       hostile,             words       like B a s t a r d s ,         Murderers,

 Pigs,        rained          down         from       those       seated           above      the     terracing.

 The     fans        on th e         p itch were              pushing          fighting            to get       back        into      the

 crowd and              for a m o m e n t             it s e e m e d      that         for    every       two       persons          t h at    came

 out,     one w e n t           hack         in.

 After        a    time       an     orderly           confusion             developed and                s om e     form       of

 disorganised                 system            came     into      be i n g .          Bodies       of    persons          were       handed

fence,            the    body was               placed       on    the    grass          and       left.        At    the       time      that

seemed            the    b es t      policy,           I wa s      handed          a    body,       I carried             it,    placed         it,

left      it       then       went        for       another.            Everyone             was    blue,       lifeless an d                 limp.

I cannot            account              fo r    how many          I carried,                I am     unable         to    describe            any

particular               one       nor      can       I say       how    long          I was       doing      that,        but       I was

suddenly aware                     that         the    hoardings          around           me      were    being          torn apart            and

 ferried          the     body across               the      ground        towards           the H o p        end.

 On arrival             at     that      end     I saw about               20    bodies           l y i ng    on       th e    g ra s s ,       all

 very       blue;       al l    very       d e a d.       An am bu lan ce             attempted              to    get        into       the

 another          10/15        bodies        lying        on t h e       concrete.

 I am       unable        to    r ec a l l     what       I did       next       nor    the        t im e     scale           involved              but

 t he    next      thing        I find         is     that     I have           returned           to     the      Leppings              Lane

 Bodies       were        still       on th e         grass      an d as         I felt           for a       pulse           on    one,        a

 person        in a       suit      walking           along      the       goal       line a n d as               he    stepped           over

 the     lifless          forms       he     looked down             on     each pointed                to    left        and           right

 and     said      " H e ’s g o n e "        "He's           dead"         "He *s g o n e "         and      so        on a n d so          for th .

 The     feeling          of    total        inadequacy was                   overwhelming.

 I wander,           look,         se e a n d       h ea r    the     continual              abuse.           A scuffle                 breaks

 “ I went         to H e y z e l      I saw         t ha t    I hate          coppers         but       that       lad        (indicating
