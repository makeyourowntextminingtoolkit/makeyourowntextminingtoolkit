             At 0800 am Saturday,               15 April       1989,     I reported on duty at B a r n s le y

             was to be played.               I paraded on at B a r n s l e y Poli ce S t a t i o n w here we

             were    brie fed by PS Swift who was                   in charge        of the P ol ic e         c ontingent

             from B a r n s l e y who was a t t e nd i ng         from 0 8 0 0 am.          This     con ti ng en t

             PC Hooson,        his      probationer,       WPC A k r e d and we were              later     j oi ne d by

             2 police o ff i ce r s         from a squad from             S h e f f i e l d H e a d q u ar t er s .    F ro m

             B a r n s l e y we a t t e n d e d at West Bar P ol ic e S t a t i o n at a p p r o k imately 9 am

             w here we were            br ie fe d by Chief      I nspector a nd S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s

             rega rd in g    our duties         for the day.            T hese were       to consist of

             rece pt io n of both L iverpool               and N o t t i n g h a m F orest Fans at the M i d l a n d

             R a i l w a y S t a t i o n at S h e f f i e l d w he re   they were       to be d i v e r te d          to 2 lots

             of P SV buses w h i c h were to be w a it i ng                 for them at s ep a ra t e ends of

             the station.               Two officers were           then to be d e l e ga t ed to each bus to

             travel     up to the H i l l s b o r o u g h F oo t ba l l      G r o u n d w here      buses w o ul d       be

             e mp t ie d a nd fans d i re c t e d       into the g round at the a p p r o p r i a t e ends.

             We were also         inst ru ct ed to make s e ar ch es             of fans as they              came from

             the Station.
Approx imately          1013 am this date,             along w i t h other officers,               I

a t t e n d e d at the S h e f f i e l d R ai l w a y S t a t i o n to commence d uties as

instructed.          However,        once at the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n the serial             which         I

was a t t a c h e d to were          i nstruct ed to take           up position outside            the main

entrance      to the R a i l w a y Stat ion to i ntercept any fans who m a na g e d to

slip the       police      net w it hi n the s t at i on a nd a tt em pt            to go       into town

with a possible            chance of causing            trouble.          This we did and on a

number     of o c c a si on s had to divert             fans back         to the buses w h i c h were

being     laid on for them.                 Most of these         fans,    a l t h o u g h were   noisy,

were well       be ha ve d and no violence              o c c u r re d a nd there was           very little

s u g ge st io n of drink.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .30    pm    (1430)   this date all          fans had a r r i v e d by

trains and along w i th other officers we t ra ve l le d up to H i l l s b o r o u g h

on a P S V .      The    route w hi ch was t aken was                t h ro ug h H i l l s b o r o u g h village

itself on M i d d l e w o o d Road and then               into L ep p in g s Lane.          W hi ls t

trave ll in g along M i d d l e w o o d Road           I n o ti c e d that there was a number                     of

fans still w a l k i n g        towards       the ground.           We then t u rn ed      into L ep p in g s

Lane and       I no ti ce d that there was a                large     volume of fans well               into

the number        of tho us an ds          still w ai t in g   to get      into the ground.             The

area    in front        of the t urnstiles was              packed to capa ci ty a nd the                   crowd

was    spilling      out    onto      the    road i t s e l f .     T here were a number           of police

o fficers who were at the scene who were a t t e m p t i n g to                          control        the

crowd.       As we were         trav el li ng t ow ards        this     part of the g r ou n d          I

n ot ic ed H s eparate          fans who,         in my opinion,          were   e x t r e m e l y drunk and

were having to be carried by 2 friends,                             one under each arm.                I also

n ot i c e d a y o u t h who a p p e a r e d to be a p p r o x i m a t e l y 25 y ears J um p in g                in

and out of the           road    putting his          fists up to         passing vehicles.                 In my

op in io n from the view              I had from the PSV's              there a p p e a r e d     to be a

number     of fans who were drunk.                   As we        passed the t ur n st i le area,             I

also    noticed a n u m ber of supporte rj^ c 1 imbi rtg onto                      the top of the

                                                                                                          R3 1 5

p roducing       tickets       or trying to enter w it h ou t             tickets at all.                The

officers who were              on duty at this          point    in no way         could stop these

y ou th s     doing what       they were doing due to the                 c ir c um s tn a ce s    of the

rest of the           crowd w h i c h were o b v i o u s l y    pushing       to o b t a i n e n t ry as

quick as        possible as the time at this                   point was a p p r o x i m a t e l y quarter

to three.            We then tra ve ll ed from the turn st il es a long L e p p i n g s Lane

towards        the    r oundabout at Niagara.             All    a long     this       road the re we re

still        hundreds     of fans still w a lk i n g       towards        the ground.             We then

t r a v el le d to the N o t t i n g h a m Fores t       side of the g ro un d w h i c h was on

P e n i st on e R o ad N o r t h E nt ra n c e a nd this was a t ot al ly d i ff er en t

scene.         There were       very few supp or t er s a w ai t i n g         to o b ta i n e ntry and

e v er yt hi ng was       quiet.      We were     i ns tr u ct e d to go to the g y m n a si u m as

we were a reserve              serial    for the m a t c h      itself and there we o bt a in e d a

dr i n k .

A b o ut 3.0 0 pm        (1500)    this date,       we were      i n st ru ct ed b y S e r g e an t Swift

to a t te nd w i th him onto the              perimeter        track    in front         of the L ep p in g s

L an e    track.       We had been in the g ro u nd a p p r o x i m a t e l y one m in ut e when

we were g iven these              instructions.          We w a l k e d on the          p erimeter       track

to the L e p p in gs Lane          end where we were            i n s tr u ct e d to take         up

positions a l on g           the track     facing the L e p p i ng s Lane              end.   I w a l k e d up

the end of the L ep pi n g s Lane S t an d nearest                     to the      police     control

room.        T here    I remember       being    stood w it h PC Packer.                 At this        time   it

was obvious           that    there was a large number              of people           in the     crowd in

the      central      s ec t i o n and there were a number              of people who w er e being

p ushed a ga in st        the fencing.          There were screams             coming from the             crowd

but at this           time    it a p p e a r e d that   it was    just a       *p u s h ’ that was         being

m ad e    by fans      from b ehind and         it was    not evident          to m ys el f       the

e n or mity of the           incident.      1 saw a number          of y ouths          open the small

e m e r g e nc y gates and burst onto the                track.        O ff i ce r s    then pushed them
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           R 315

back     into the          crowd as      it was    felt that       they were t rying           to    invade

the track           itself.      This sort of a c t i o n       is normal        p rocedure at a

football           match.      However,      w it h in a very short         space of time            I    am

un able      to say what,          but     I w ou ld e st i ma t e about 30 seco nd s              to a

minute,        I think all         officers       real is ed that     the      p os i ti o n was more

serious.            I did not      see at this time any d e ce as ed persons                       but    it was

obvious       that the         people on the front were              g ra d ua l ly h aving more

pressure           put on them.          The Z small       gates were then o p en e d and fans

were     pulled out          of the      crowd.     The    initial    fans w h i c h      came out w e r e ,

although           short    of b re at h and some were          suff er in g     slight      crush

injuries,          were well       and a p p e ar ed to be alright.              I began to direct

these      fans      into the side e nclos ur e            under    the    police       control      box and

still      not      r ealising     the e nor mi ty of the          incident.        I    remember         one fan

stood on the track J umping up and d o w n shout in g a nd w a t c h i n g                               the game

from the track and not m aking any a t te mp t                       to go to the other g a t e .                    I

got hold of this               lad and      pushed him tow ards           the side       enclosure.            This

c on ti nue d for a short while and then we b egan to                            realise       that the

p ro bl em was more            serious at w h ic h stage we           began to take the

advertising           boards     down w h ic h were        on the    pitch      itself     to a l lo w more

room to bring              spect at or s   out on to.        Duri ng all        this    time       1 began

he aring the fans              s creaming     for h el p and shou ti ng for us to do

something.            We we re also being spat at               from the        crowd.      We      then

c on ti nue d d r a g gi ng      people out and g r a d u a l l y they a p p e a r e d             to be more

s e r i o us l y    injured but still          there were       no persons        d e c e a se d    that were

pul 1ed out.

W hi le we were            s t oo d at the fencing         I saw a w o ma n      I b e li ev e w i t h dark

hair,      in a red a no ra k         pressed up a g ai ns t        the    fence and either her

h u s b a n d or b oy f r i e n d was      stood behi nd her also              in a red a n or ak w it h

his arms           up to either       side of her h ea d pressing a ga inst                 the fence           in

a n attemp t         to shield her from the               pressure.       At    this    stage       this w om an
                                                                                                         PAGE              5

ap ea re d to be alive.            1 then c on t in u ed     in a s s i st i ng       fans who were

being    pulled out by officers at the gate,                      the gate was             only

s u f f i ci en tl y wide    enough for one fan to be               pulled out at a time and

only s ufficie nt at the m a x i m u m of 3 offic er s                 to be at that              gate

pulling them out any more               officers at         that gate w o u l d just              have

b lo cked    it off    totally.        I therefo re       stood back and a s s i s t e d               in

getting      c asualties      onto    the   pitch.      We were       joined by other                 ofHcers

i m me di at el y and some         officers     began   climbing on the               fenc in g       in an

attempt      to pull     people      out of the       crowd.      However,           people were that

t ig htly    packed that       it was almost          impossible       for one offi ce r               to pull

persons      up a l t h o u g h some officers         did m an ag e    it.         P e op l e   then began

climbing      on top of each other              in an a tt e mp t     to escape and all were                          in

total    panic.       I then       remember     t ur ning and      looking at           the couple w hi ch

I prev io us ly d e s c r i b e d and       realis ed that       the w o m an had gone                blue       in

the f a c e , her eyes a p p e a r e d g la ze d and she was                 fro thing at the

mouth.       It was    obvious that          she was     deceased.           Her     partner was also

vorrd 11 i ng from the m o ut h but a p p e a r e d to be alive.                       I then         looked

furt he r back      into the         crowd and    1 could see an old m an who was                           being

sq ua s he d and a p p e a r e d    to be    losing     total    consciou sn es s.              There was

no way that we           could get to any of them.                 I then n ot i ce d that the

fencing,       the actual       wire meshing,         was   b e gi nn in g    to buckle and

g ra d u a l l y get w o rs e and buckle         to s om e th i ng    like 6- 1 2 inches.                   We

then had the        p roblem of a public order                 s i t u a t i o n on the         pitch itsei-f

and     I remember       one y o ut h screami ng and shouting                 that his sister was

 still      in there a nd was s ufferi ng            from asthma.            I told him to stand

 back and a l lo w us to get as m a n y people as we                       could out            but    in the

 panic and em ot io n         , w h i c h one   cannot      blame,    he     c o nt in ue d to try and

 get to the gate            to get to his sister.              However,       this did nothing more

 than hamper       the      police    officers who were           trying      their        best at that

 stage.       I then remember          seeing a m an who          I p resume was w i t h his son at
the front       of the        fence.      He    too    had his arms          p re ss ed up a g ai n s t      the

fence trying           to    protect     his    son    who was in a very d i s t r e s s e d s t a t e .

However,       still        there was no        w ay   that we could get             to     t hese    people.

The only way to get to them                     was    t hr o ug h the gate a nd a few over                  the

top.     H o w e v e r , itw as all           so obvio us     or a p p e a r e d o b v i o u s , that had

m ore   bodies        cl im be d onto the fence to try a nd pull                       them up this          could

have    led to the fence              coll ap s in g    into the          crowd a nd      causing      even more

d eaths and      injuries.            At this      stage a l t h o u g h we         could see        people were

dying and people              g oing under       the    crowd a nd         losing sight        of them       it

did not a ppear             f ro m the gate that          I was at that there was a nyone

d ec ea s e d being         p ulled o u t .     H o w e v e r , the e n o r m it y of the        incident was

be co mi ng mo re a nd m ore a p p a re nt a nd              police o f f i c er s w er e d e s p e ra t e         in

t rying to save             people.      Supporters        both on the          pitch a nd       in the      crowd

itself were           s h o u ti ng at off ic er s a nd s p i t t in g a n d trying              to get them

to do mo re but             there was no w a y the o ff i ce r s             in this area,            incl ud in g

myself,     could do a ny m o r e .             Then as more         fans were         t yr in g to get out

the gate       itself got         b lo c k e d by the e n or mo us          number     of    persons      trying

to get t hr o u g h a small            gap at o n c e .        I remember at this               stage     that a

large man who            I b el ie ve had a w h it e         top on was t r ap p e d w i t h the top

half    of his body           lying on the track on his back and                          from his w aist

d o w nw ar ds was      t r a p p e d w i t h i n the t e r r a c i n g    over the e n t r a nc e      of the

gate.      Along w i t h other           officers,        I a t t e m p t e d to     pull at his arms to

pull    him out w h i l e        other    off ic e rs were        frantically          s ho u ti n g at us to

do t h i s .    We t r ie d but w ere           t o ta l l y u n su c ce s sf u l    a nd this was        due to

the a mount      of pre ss ur e        on his b o t t o m half            by the fans at         the g a t e .

This    caused a large             jam at the gate           for what        s ee me d an e t e r n i t y no

one a p p e a r e d    to be coming           t hr o ug h this gate.

1 do    remember PC T aylor              stood h an g in g       f ro m the     f e nc in g a t t e m p t i n g   to

pul 1 persons          out    of the     crowd     itself.        At this       point       I s t o od back a nd

l oo ke d at the w hole            scene and       I could see that             fans were        b eing     pulled
up to the top of the s eating a r e a by other fans and fans were

climbing over             the    side       fencing a s s i s t e d by the                s u pp or te rs .        There

were a number of                fans    s wearing a nd s ho u ti n g at us on the                           pitch and

both from the             t e r ra ci ng a nd the y o u t h                I m e n t i o n e d e ar li er as trying

to get         his    sister     had to be c h a s ti s ed on a number of o c c a s i o n s                            by

o f f i ce rs a l t h o u g h    the o ffice rs a p p r e c i a t e d the s i t u a t i o n he was                        in

and no at te mp t was made                   to    lock h im up even t h o u g h there was

s u ff ic ie nt       evidence       there.            W hil st    all      this was        going     on a number              of

officers,            inc lu di ng myself,              was    t ry in g to wave at fans                 to tell        them

to move         back     out    of the stand              itself        but    I reme mb er        s eeing a small

crowd just j u m p i n g and                cheering as t h o u g h nothing was                       g oing off.

H ow e v e r    I do feel        that a n y b o d y w i t h a bit of                    common sense w o u l d have

known there was a serious                         pr ob l em at the            front of the           pitch.         There

were a number             of s enior o fficer s who were                          tryi ng     to o r g a n is e     the

o f ficers       but there was a large                       numbe r       of fans m i ll i n g       in a nd out of

other      police        off ic er s w h i c h h a m p e r e d          ins tr uc ti on s.         H o we ve r,    along

w i t h other officers,                we made two              lines       either       side of the          gate a nd we

b e g an to drag          people o u t , two off ic e rs                    per     p erson a nd d r a g g i n g       them

on to the            pitch w i t h     instru ct io ns            to    commence         r es u sc i ta t io n .     This was

c o m m en ce d a n d t he n we         began to try a n d f or m a c o nv ey or                        belt and

d e c e a s e d bodies were            being       passed a l on g            the    line onto        the     p itch

itself         in the hope that medical                       attention           could be g i v en to them

immediately.              H owever,         as we w ere           pulling         these     people      out    it was

q uite o bvious           that    t hey were            deceased           this was due          to the       colour of

the f a c e , the         smell      a nd    it was          o b vi o us    from looking at the                c l ot hi ng

that     they had         lost all          b odily funct io ns .                 The    terr ac e    suddenly

appeared         to b ecome a lmost               empty a n d          I could see a n u mb er              of bodies

piled up and a crush barrier                            collapsed.             Part      of this      c rush barrier

was t hr o w n by a fan at                  the    police         o ff i ce r s who w er e on the f en cing

attempting            to save      lives.          I    b el ie ve      the barr ie r         did hit a police

officer.         The    people        that    I had seen at the front of the t erracing

had just d i s a p p e a r e d and           I have   no doubt      that these         persons        fell    to

the floor w he n the            pressure was          t ak en o f f .     I remember       d uring      the

incident,        although       I cannot        say at what       point,      I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4

or 3 fans seem to s tep backwards a mo ng                        the    crush shou ti ng

a p p r o x i m a t e l y at the      location of the          crush barrier.          We then had to

move    bodies w h i c h were on the              pitch further           in in an a t te m pt         to give

us more        room for     the other          bodies w h i c h we re being           pulled out        so that

a ny first aid that was                 possible      could be given.            Once all        the bodies

were out        I i n st ru ct ed 3 or 4 fans w i t h an a d v e r t i s i n g           b o ar di ng a nd         I

placed a m an on the               boarding and b egan running towards P e n i s t o n e R oa d

end of the g ro un d where other                  people w er e being t aken for

tereatment.            The m a n that was on this was                  o b v i o us l y dead at this

stage.         However,     it was       in an a tt em pt      to get him to the medical                     team

hoping that         s o m e th in g    could be done        for h i m .      W he n   I got     to that end

there was a large             number of bodies at               that    corner and       I placed the

m an down a nd         left him for the m ed ical              staff      to check      him.        I then ran

back    to the L e p p i n g s Lane end           in order       to fetch further             people from

there.         However,     on my return all             the    bodies and        c a su al ti es     that were

to be m o ve d had been.                I then took up posit io n on part of the fencing

that had been pulled a way on the                       i n st ru ct io ns   of a senior         officer       to

stop people going             in and out of the             crowd.

could find and he w a l k e d us off via the P e n i s to n e R oa d end.                              We were

taken     round near        to the g ym n a s i u m and sat down.                Also at        the    start of

the    incident w h en we began m oving a d v e r t i s i n g                boards we were also

In conclusion,           one of the m ain problems                 onto the track a r e a was                the
