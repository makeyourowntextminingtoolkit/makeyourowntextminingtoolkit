              DAVID SCOTT HENRY        PC 2316 MOUNTED DEP           AfiaEAor- '



              At 8.00am Saturday 15 April,          I reported for duty at the mounted

              stables at Niagara in connection with the F .A. Cup Semi-Final Match

              between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool F .C .                 General duties were

              carried out after this time Until-11.30am that date when,                             together

              with other mounted officers          I was deployed in accordance with
                                                      k ! (2-~
              instructions       received from Inspector Hand-Davis of the Mounted

Q/?T   ^      De pa r tme nt



              In view of the fact that mounted officers from other foreign forces

              were in attendance at this match,         I was deputed to work with

              Policewoman 156 Main of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary Mounted

              Department.        Our specifiedjdutl^ss^was the supervision of Nottingham

              Forest supporters on Peni stone Road,         they being allocated that part of

              the ground of the Hillsborough Stadium.              These duties were                  carried

              out with comparative ease and no problems arose during my period of

              deployment at this       location.
At approximately 1;2>5pm that date a radio message was received from

Inspector Hand-Davis j ^ q u e ^ ^ T g ^ >rtwo) further mcmnted officers to

a t t e n d ^ a ^ ^ f a d ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ r i d g e Rj^Uhgay Station to assist with the escort of

.Liverpool fans to the ground ie the Leppings Lane end of the

complex.     Together with Policewoman Main,           I attended at that

^ C L «       Whilst en route to the railway station along Halifax

Road, we were met by large numbers of Liverpool                supporters who were

making their way to the ground.            However,    I also saw literally

hundreds other Liverpool         supporters sitting on walls and at the sides

of the road drinking from cans and bottles of what appeared to be

alcohol.     They were making no attempt to go to the stadium.



Many of those also walking to the ground from their own transport

were seen to be in possession of large amounts of alcohol, mainly 4

packs of lager and beer.          The footpaths and roadside was strewn with

discarded cans.



On arrival at Wads 1ey Station,         again on instructions from Inspector

H a n d - Da vi s, I took up a position at the front of the train escort

which had only just arrived.           After a short      period of time,      together

with a Merseyside Mounted Officer            I led the train escort down Halifax

Road to the Leppings Lane end of the stadium.                 The escort was flanked

on its nearside by six        (6) other mounted officers and foot officers.

The fans on this escort were generally well behaved and did not                     pose

me any personal      problems.



Whilst en route to the ground along Halifax Road,                the scene was much

as before?    largfe numbers of people making their way to the ground;

many of whom were      carrying and drinking from cans and bottles, of

lager and beer and others sat down and laid down at the sides Of the
 fqotp'ath> surrounded by more cans of alcoilol.                      I heard many of these

 who were at the Side of the road ask of those on the train escort for

 spare match tickets.              I did not see any pass hands.



 When tMe train escort             reached the junction with Leppings Lane,              one

 had no alternative but to allow it to intermingle with the many other

 hundreds of Liverpool             supporters who were making their own way along

 that road towards the ground.                   Yet again many of these were      consuming

 alcohol     from cans and bottles which, when emptied,                   were discarded at

 the side of the road.



 Qr^-yj^i&al at the L e ^ p ^ v ^ s mJimg jiu u ,-e n d   of the stadium I saw that the

 area around that end of the ground was already inundated with a

 large influx of Liverpool supporters.                      Other mounted officers were

yalready in position at that location dealing with the control and

 supervision of the fans entering the ground.                        There did not appear to

 be many problems at this stage.



The situation on Leppings Lane was such that the bridge which crosses

the River Don, adjacent to the ground was thronged with people who

were sitting and standing about,                    still drinking cans of lager and

beer and other alcoholic beverages.                       These   people making their way

from the Middlewobd Road area to the Leppings Lane turnstiles via

this bridge were then having to walk on to the road into the path of

oncoming vehicular traffic.                   It was possible that someone may have

been injured as a result of this.



On instructions from Inspector Hand-Davis,                        together with Policewoman

Main, and two other Merseyside Mounted Officers,                        I attempted to

persuade many of the faps around the bridge to move away.                         Most
    refused to move and those who did merely changed location to the

    other side of the      road and continued drinking from their cans and,

    bottles.     Many of   these people appeared to be in drunken states                but

(   the situation being as it was, with 2-3,000 persons ijn the area,                    it

     as both pract i cally                     i . p o s s i M . to_do a n t i n g   about

    this matter.     On one occasion,    I took   it upon myself, whilst             riding

    the full    length of the bridge,    to knock off the bridge wall and into

    the river numerous empty partially full and unopened cans and bottles

    of mainly lager.



    On my own initiative      1 abandoned this idea as it was not having any

    desired effect and the majority of the supporters appeared to treat

    our requests with      total disregard in that we were treated to a

    barrage of verbal      abuse and obscenities.



    At one stage    I do recall a radio transmission being passed,

    /requesting that Leppings Lane be closed off to all vehicular traffic



    By this time I could see that the turnstiles            leading to the Lepping

    Lane   (standing area)   for Liverpool    supporters was very heavily

    ' c o w e s t e d and large numbers of them were   literally pushing and

     moving    in waves from the back of the queues.



    0 tjne^jjnmu^              were already in the area and appeared to be

     taking vair^e^uest^s and attempts to sj^yv the pushing in order that

    the pressure on those at the front of the turnstiles could be relieved,



    I then took up a position next to the iron perimeter gates which gave

    access to the standing area and together with other mounted officers,

    attempted to form a barrier wi th horses through the crowd.                  The idea
being that pressure on the queues from those surging could be

relieved,   this preventing     possible    injuries to those most at risk ie

those nearest the turnstiles.           The fans by this time were   clearly

incensed,   many still drinking and obviously the worse for wear and

blatantly refused to stop pushing and move back.



On numerous occasions myself and my horse were being pushed sideways

into the metal uprights which supported the perimeter ga tes.            This

  used more supporters to surge past me, adding to the congestion

already at the turnstiles.        A number of fans also crawled on hands

    knees between my horses legs just to get nearer to the turnstiles.



The mood of the fans was somewhat nasty and many vented their feelings

at not being able to get       into the ground,    on myself and other mounted

officers.    This   consisted of obscene verbal abuse,      being spat on and

aeing showered with alcoholic       liquid.



It was impossible to maintain a static barrier of horses as the

horses and riders were literally being shoved out of the way by the

surging mass.



At one point    I saw a          loy being passed over head high from the

queuing fans at the front of the queues                              away from

the turnstiles.     He appeared to be in a limp and dazed state.



As a result of what       I had seen,    I again made many requests of the

mass on my nearside to again stop pushing and to move back,            but I was

again met with a barrage of abuse.



I also caught sight of a number of fans; scaling the perimeter wall
adjacent    to G a t e   B and   gain   entry   to   the   ground.




A number of both youngish and middle aged supporters around me who

were in obvious fear for their own safety tried in vain to stop the

  shing from behind them by shouting                 verbally at their fellow

supporters.



Those entering the ground via the turnstiles appeared to be doing so

only slowly due to the congestion around them.



I saw two fellow mounted officers a U e m p t               to foirm orderly queues on

the approach to the turnstiles but this was again a physical
   /                                            ’
ipyfrossibi l it y .     They were 1 iteral ly being shovec^asjide by sheer

wf^jht^ of numbers who had total disregard for the horses                  presence.



At one point      in the events,         it was decided that the iron perimeter

gates should be closed,           this providing an extra barrier to assist the

f>6rses and prevent the incessant surging from behind.                   Foot officers

on the outer side of the gates attempted to physically hold them in a

Closed position so that those fans nearest the turnstiles                   could be

made to enter the ground as safely as possible.



Those fans to my nearside             (those outside the perimeter gates)        some

2 - 3,000 in number were by this time even more increased..                   They were

in time being joined by still more supporters just arriving at the

ground.     I tried to explain to those around me that people were being

crushed at the front of the queues.                  Some appeared to Understand the

problem,    but others,       still     consuming alcohol,, were oblivious to any

form of reasoning whatsoever.               They still attempted to force their

way through.       On two occasions         I assisted fathers with young       children
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             R92

to escape tfis melee a n d through the gates to relative safety.



Some   irate faris insisted on trying to climb over the iron gates and

on occasions I had to refrain them from doing so by physically

pulling them from off of the gates.       I caught sight Of one youth

behind me with a lighted cigarette      in his hand.     He was being urged

on by some of those around him to stub his cigarette out on my horses

hind quarters.     I attempted to refrain him from doing so,            but the

situation being as it was,    I could only speak to him severely about

the consequences of his actions      ie that my horse may kick out and

strike someone Causing    injury and that he could be arrested for his

behav io u r .



As the numbers of those queuing at the turnstiles slowly diminished,

th^ iron perimeter gates were slowly opened so that those outside

could then form queues in some semblance of order.           However, at this

instant, a surge of hundreds of fans      literally s w a m p e c ^ ^        the

gates towards the turnstiles - some through their own volition,               but

others,    through sheer weights of numbers surging from behind.



I saw some people near to me stumble and fall to the ground and get

trampled on by others    in their eagerness to get into the ground.

Young children were screaming out in fear and I personally felt at

this time that someone was going to be seriously injured in the

melee,    particularly those nearest the turnstiles.



I made several    local appeals   to those surging from the rear but was

again met witH taunts and verbal abuse and most of all, a blatant

refusal to stop surging.     I did notice that many of those around me ,

were still -drinking from cans and bottles.        I managed to confiscate
 and dispose of some of them but many refused to hand them over.



 The throng of people in the area at the time was such that I felt it

 would only add to the already dangerous situation if I went into the

 crowd with my horse,       that I gently withdrew him.             As well as being          in

 fear for my own safety and that of my horse,                I Was most fearful      for

 the safety of the supporters around ise.



 Although jj^acLU) recept ion was p o o r ^ u e ^ t o   the shouting and screaming

 round about me,      I do recall a message        requesting one of the

 ^nc^j^na^at^          to fcMj^ojjjejned up to   relieve the pressure on the

 turnstiles.      People were     literally being       crushed and no amount of

^ vocal or physical     persuasion could prevent          it.     I first noticed

 ’Gate A* being opened        (this leads to the North Stand)           for a short

 period of time.       This allowed an influx of supporters             into the ground

 thus   relieving the pressure at that           location.       This was followed,       I

 -believe, a short time later by Gate            'C'.   This also housed a large

 influx of fans     into the West Stand area.           I cannot     recall Gate    'B'

 being opened although it may well           have been.         My attention was

 concentrated on what was happening directly towards me.                   I was

 literally being shoved into the perimeter gate upright with no room

 for manoeuvre.      Even after the concertina Gates              'A* ~ ’C* were again

 in a closed position there were still many hundreds of fans still

 outside the ground.



 I held my position as best as I could but eventually withdrew to

 await further    instructions.       I was then detailed with five other

 officers to attend at the rear of the North Stand via Gate                  *0* on

 standby for a possible pitch invasion.

                                                                                                .R92

                    •Oharrival    at that    location it became apparent that there was no play

                    on the field and after a short time I saw numerous               persons of both

               'xA* sexes, "both dead a n d a l i v e   being carried on makeshift' stretchers from

          ■Q        the playing area,      past me to the gymnasium.      Some time later the

 rh                 match was officially abandoned and I was directed to patrol the

              v      exterior perimeter of the stadium in company with Inspector Hand-
          ,         n
                  ,/L^Davis, to supervise the dispersal of fans from the area.  I was later

      \             stood down to Niagara stables where          I later retired from duty.



                     In my 13 years experience as a Police Officer, 8 of which have been

                    as a mounted officer,        I have regularly policed large football matches

                     throughout South Yorkshire.          Many of these have been at the

                    Hillsborough Stadium,        including previous F.A. Cup Semi-Finals.         In

                     all these years,      I have never come across a situation as bad as I

                     have described.       The actions which I have carried out on this

                     occasion are similar to those which I have carried out on numerous

                     previous occasions at .football matches,         but never before have     I been

                    met with such hostility and drunken abusive behaviour from football

                    fans, who seemed,       in the main,    totally oblivious to any requests for

                     calm and order.



                    Since the events of Saturday 15 April           I have sinee ins£e_ct_ed my horse

                    a/(d have found that there are several         lumps on both its re^j^jT^n^and^

                    oj^~-h^ndjuart^s.         The coat surrounding those lumps appears singed

                    which may be consistent with having lighted cigarettes stubbed out on^

                    his body.     I have    informed Inspector Hand-Davis of this matter.          I

                    have never known this to happen before and it merely confirms the

                    physical drunken state of many of those fans at Leppings Lane and

                    their total disregard for fellow man or animal.
