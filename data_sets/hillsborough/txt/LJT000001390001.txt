      Appraisal of Sports Grounds                  : The Institution of   Structural
      Engineers report : May 1991

     I am writing to bring the above report to your attention.   The
     report was originally commissioned in July 1986 and was given
     impetus by the tragedies at the Birmingham, Bradford and Hysel
     football grounds.    You will remember that a substantially
     complete draft report was made available to your own Inquiry
     following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, and the published
     version of the report takes account of the recommendations made
     in the report of the Inquiry.

     A feature of the report is the recognition that appraisal of
     sports grounds cannot be undertaken solely on the basis of the
     condition of the structure and fixtures. The manner of operation
     and control is equally important and there is strong interaction
     between the physical and organisational requirements.        The
     breadth of interest is reflected by the contents of the report
     and the range of expertise of the Task Group primarily concerned
     with its drafting.

      I hope you feel that the report adds to the results of your
      Inquiry. The intention was that it should be useful for anyone
      involved with owning, operating, appraising or licensing sports
      grounds. In addition, much of the material considered is equally
      relevant to the design of new facilities.




                                                                               ./cont
                              -   2 -


The Institution is to hold a one-day meeting on the report on the
topic of appraising sports grounds on 17 October 1991; 1 should
be delighted if you felt able to come to the Institution on this
occasion and contribute to the meeting.

                            In July 1986, the Institution o f S tructural Engineers established an ad hoc
                            Com m ittee to draw together technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal ol'
                            sports grounds an d their individual elem ents. The C om m ittee’s task was to
                            establish a referenced body o f knowledge th at w ould be com plem entary to the
                            Guide to safety at sports grounds. This Guide, first published in 1975, was
                            revised following the Inquiry by M r. Justice Popplew ell into the tragedies at
                            B irm ingham , B rad fo rd and Hysel football grounds in 1985. In January 1990
                            following the fu rth er disaster at H illsborough Stadium in A pril 1989, the final
                            rep o rt by the Rt. H o n . L o rd Justice T aylor was published containing
                            ‘recommendations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports
                            events’. These recom m endations have been studied a n d where appropriate

                             m ainly concentrates on m easures to see th at existing grounds are safe.
                                Sports grounds differ widely in configuration, size, condition a n d usage. To

                             could jeopardize public safety. It also requires an understanding o f b o th the

1.4.8 Testing o f barriers
As part of the appraisal process, the engineer will need,
with the agreement of the certifying authority where
required, to schedule barriers that should be tested and
subsequently to record those results.
1.4.9 Inspection during use
Where because of the nature or condition or configuration
of a ground, or of a particular event at that ground,
emphasis is placed on active measures to ensure crowd
safety, an inspection during use of the ground may be
required so that the club’s engineer and certifying
authorities can witness the interaction of passive and active
functions of crowd control and, in particular, assess the
quality and organization of the stewarding.
   Record of the prevailing conditions and results of this
inspection during use should also be included in the club’s
operating manual.

1.4.10 Certification and reporting o f the appraisal
A chief purpose of the appraisal is to establish reasonable
levels of safety. This appraisal can then be submitted to
the club in written form, with illustrations as necessary.
In the case of a certified ground in the UK it can form the
background to the annual inspection by the local authority
whose responsibility it is to define this club certificate. This
inspection will generally need to involve a club
representative together with the certifying officers and their
structural, mechanical and electrical engineers and means-
of-escape advisers as necessary, together with
representatives from the police and fire services.
   Certification of the capacity of a ground is based on its
existing condition. Remedial measures may be necessary
to improve the state of the ground so that an increased
capacity can be safely accommodated. The main body of
this report gives guidance on this process.

2.3 Refurbishment and reconstruction
without disruption to club activities
2.3.1 General
Changes in legislation and the need to make significant
improvements in the provisions for spectators have pre­
sented football clubs with a serious challenge to their
existence. Clubs of different standing and for different
principal sporting uses are confronted by major expendi­
ture on their existing grounds in order to meet future
standards of comfort, safety and competition.
   Functional and financial considerations often necessitate
redevelopment work being carried out in phases, and
management of projects of this kind requires special
technical and practical skills especially in the case of large-
span structures. Whether the aim is to construct a single
stand within an existing ground or to create a completely
new complex, the project requires technical, managerial
and financial skills of a (high calibre.
2.3.2 Preplanning
There are many important matters to be considered in the
refurbishment or creation of sports grounds, and pre­
planning and project management are essential elements
of reconstruction.
  Preplanning commences with a definition of the overall
concept of the proposal for development, by identifying
and researching the potential market for the facilities and
by making arrangements for financing the reconstruction
work. The importance of obtaining a clear and compre­
hensive brief agreed by all parties before commencing the
works cannot be overemphasized.
  During refurbishment safety provisions should at least
comply with the requirements of the Guide9. Conformity
with fire regulations is of paramount importance.
   Management will need to estimate the necessary work
and prepare a financial operating plan so that the aims can
be achieved.

   In a new design using materials with low flame-spread
characteristics and non-combustible construction, the fire
potential is low. However, smoke is still likely to be the
main risk to the public. Each case should be considered
individually. Factors such as limited fire load, and the
considerable time taken to fill a very large volume should
be reviewed, along with the need for a smoke-control
scheme and other fire-protection measures.
   Although completely covered grounds in which both the
sporting activity and spectators are covered by one single
enclosure do not come under the Safety at sports grounds
A c t20, many of the criteria and recommendations
concerning category 2 stands are appropriate to covered
grounds.

This larger dimension allows for pedestrians carrying
personal articles, psychological preference to avoid bodily
contact with others and body sway. Body sway occurs even
while standing in order to aid blood circulation and to rest
leg muscles.
    American practice is to consider different ‘levels of
service’. The Highway capacity manua? developed six
levels of design for road traffic, based on service volumes
 and a qualitative evaluation of driver convenience. The
 level of service concept was developed by Fruin2 to the
 design of pedestrian spaces. The following locations were                         Level of service D

clear identification of exit routes is of major importance.
   It should be recognized in the capacity calculations that
spectators do not distribute uniformly between exits.
Unacceptable congestion at particular exits may arise, even
if there are sufficient exits overall, e.g. if one exit is close
to a railway station.
   Protection provided to stairs, landings and passageway
should be enclosed to a standard such as not to pass a
100mm diameter ball through the protection.
   Splitter barriers are those that are arranged parallel with
the flow and split it into separate lanes. They have a
regulatory effect, help to reduce surge pressures and
provide a desirable hand support on one side. Some
reduction of flow occurs with lanes less than 1.1m wide,
and such lanes should be excluded from flow calculations.


5.8 Crush barriers
It is important that crowd pressures cannot be generated
so as to cause injury to those spectators pressed against
the barrier, and it is of paramount importance that collapse
of barriers under crowd pressure does not occur. It should
be recognized, however, that on terraces, viewing slopes
and elsewhere maximum pressures will occur when all
spectators contribute simultaneously to the build-up of
pressure. Although this seldom occurs, it is likely to cause
gross discomfort rather than actual injury. It is important
therefore that no undersized or understrength crush
barriers are permitted.
   The Guide1 contains guidance on the spacing of
barriers. Where the horizontal distance between crush
barriers is greater than that recommended in the Guide'
the area beyond the recommended distance should be
discounted for capacity calculations.
   For some events, such as ‘pop’ concerts, barriers may
need to be provided in front of the audience to create a
‘sterile’ zone between audience and the stage, racetrack,
etc. Care is needed in the design of such barriers that they
are both adequate elements in themselves and properly
founded and that they do not cause injury from excess
pressure on individuals against the barriers. Padding out
may be necessary to prevent this. Consideration should also
be given to curved barriers, with areas for overspill at each
end.
   Appendix F has been included to provide professional
engineers, architects, surveyors, etc. with the scientific
background to barrier design and which may in certain
instances be necessary for a proper appraisal.
   Where barriers are substandard either by strength, height
or in any other way do not comply with the Guide' they
should be excluded from capacity calculations. Where any
barriers are so substandard as to offer a positive risk to
safety they should be removed or such areas taken out of
use.

6.10 Replacement or strengthening of weak
Structural elements
Where either the survey or subsequent testing or appraisal
shows an element to be unsatisfactory, it should be either
replaced or suitably strengthened. Such considerations may
well require the installation of temporary support until such
time as the permanent remedial work can be undertaken.
All such temporary works should be designed and con­
structed with the location and nature of usage in mind and
be reasonably proof against vandalism.
   Adequate access will need to be provided to undertake
these measures, so that they can be correctly effected and
inspected prior to commissioning.

   Inspection should be made for effects of corrosion on
all elements of the structure, and that the fire separation
of the construction from other structures is sufficient.
   Fixings and handrails for all platforms, stairways, etc.
must be adequate.
   Means of escape from such temporary stands on
evacuation must be direct to a sufficient place of safety
outside. Special care needs to be taken so that in providing
sufficient means of egress from a temporary stand or place
of assembly that the capacity of means of egress from
existing or adjacent structures is not impaired (and vice
versa).

The perceptions of people in a crowd determine whether the crowd
crush will be just an unpleasant experience, or end in disaster.
People in a crowd do not have a broad view of what is happening
around them, and unless authoritative information is received
from a reliable source, will act on the speculations of others
nearby. If there is a perception of danger, the human flight
response can cause the sudden type of movement that unleashes
the massed energy of the crowd. The opposite of the flight
response can also occur — a ‘craze’, or competitive scramble to
attain some intensely desired or valued objective. The Cincinnati
Coliseum and Pope’s tour incidents are examples of the type of
rush where no threat exists.
   In systems analysis, information is also viewed in other ways.
For example, tickets that require patrons to use different entrances
are an information element that reduces crowding by spreading
patrons out over a larger and more separated area. Another
example is the time-of-arrival ticket, like those used in the King
Tut exhibit tour, which regulates patron arrivals by spreading
them over a longer time period. The reserved seat ticket, as
compared to general admission, can be considered an information
 element, because it reduces the urgency connected with attempts
to obtain a better seat.

Architectural design
To prevent crowding and facilitate pedestrian movement, places
of public assembly should provide several dispersed entrances and
exits rather than centralised ones. Well-designed auditoriums
characteristically have direct lines of patron flow and clear lines
of sight. Circuitous and narrow passageways, ‘dogleg’ routes,
obscured doorway^ and stairs, and ambiguous pathways create
confusion, and in an emergency flight response situation, have
the potential for disaster. In such emergencies ‘the-line-of-sight’
becomes ‘the-line-of-flight’.
 Communication
 Information strategies to modify the time, space, and energy
 elements of the crowd model not only involve the use of all types
 of media, but also the development of a well-planned
 communication network involving the manager, staff, patrons,
 and local police and emergency services. A clear chain of
 responsibility for crowd control and emergency procedures must
 be established and repeatedly reinforced. This requires formal
 designation of the authority to open and close pedestrian facilities,
 make crowd-control-related public address announcements, and
 summon emergency services. Liaison must be developed and
 actively maintained with local police, fire, and medical services,
 and respective roles clearly defined in writing, or, more effectively,
 in the form of an organization chart. Special events that increase
 patron attendance beyond the normal require a careful review
 of the crowd management plan and the adequacy of auditorium
 facilities and staffing.
    The availability and reliability of communications equipment
 and the means of its use are crowd management considerations.
 The public address system must be connected to the emergency
 lighting circuit or other standby power to ensure that communi­

    At the end of the activity the steward will:
 • secure exit door(s), or on instructions of a police officer or

the public have left the premises
• return standard key and surcoat.

Fire stewards
Each fire steward is to collect standard key and distinctive sur­
coat. Each fire-picket team leader is to collect emergency
communications radio and to deploy fire pickets.
Prematch inspections and tests to be carried out to check that
equipment is working include:
• radio
• fire alarm
• telephones where applicable
• firefighting equipment
• housekeeping: see that combustible materials are stored in
designated store areas.
   The fire steward is to identify and liaise with door steward,
and inform fire picket team leader of any problems encountered.
   On hearing fire alarm the fire steward is to check the location
of fire on the fire-alarm indicator panel. The team leader is to
report affected zone to control via radio.
   Each fire steward should proceed to affected zone collecting
firefighting equipment en route. The team leader is to assess the
incident and decide on the action to be taken.
   The team leader has to report circumstances or incident to
senior fire steward and police control, and advise on evacuation
etc. A search of the area is to be commenced, or if fire in pro­
gress, firefighting to be commenced if safe to do so.
   The team leader is to liaise with fire brigade on arrival.

    At end of specified activity the fire steward is to:
 • check stand/ground and see that members of the public have
left
• check that all firefighting equipment is in place
• report any deficiencies to the licence holder
• return all equipment.
On receiving notification of a possible fire, the senior fire steward
(or deputy) for a designated area is to adopt the following
procedures:
• see that the police control box has been informed
• respond to incident and deploy fire stwards as appropriate
• on arrival at an incident either:
  • if no fire is obvious, supervise a thorough search of the
  area, or
  • if a fire is in progress, take control of firefighting operations

                                                                           The optimum is about 150m. An optimum viewing circle can be assumed
                                                                           at 90 m from the centre spot for both association and rugby football.
As the diameter of a football is 220mm, it follows that the
maximum distance between a spectator and the furthest point
on the football playing area should not exceed 190m. It should
be borne in mind that at this distance the object is barely
recognizable and does not in fact provide a good and unstrained
visibility. The maximum distance therefore should, where
possible, be reduced by 20 % —40 % of that calculated by the
above, i.e. for a football ground the furthest point of the field
to a spectator should be limited to, say, 150m. In a football (and
also in a rugby) ground this will correspond roughly to a circle
of 90m radius from the centre spot as shown in Fig. E l.

 maximum distance in two existing grounds. In the case shown in
 Fig. E4 a section of the spectators will remain outside the optimum
 sight distance or even the maximum sight distance of the full arena.
    This consideration sometimes is most crucial in deciding whether
 the stand should have a single rake or multi-tiered ones.
    Another aspect interrelated to good viewing is the sightime. The                                   ii:
 slope of the rakers should be such that the lines-of-sight from the
 eyes of spectators in each row to the focal point should be clear
 of or at least tangential to, the top of the head (together with the
 head cover) of the spectator in the row in front. The focal point
 is taken as the near edge of the playing field or the centre-line of
 the nearest line of the nearest lane of the athletic track. The profile
 of the raker can be determined graphically and by calculation.
  Simplified formulae can be obtained from references listed in the
 Handbook!'.
    There are three main categories of raker:
  • straight rakers of constant slope
  • series of straight rakers of different slopes, and
  • curved rakers.
  The curved arrangement is theoretically ideal but cumbersome in
  practice, and apart from the high cost, there can be a safety hazard
  where crowd movement is involved. Orientation of the stand as             Fig. E4 A n example with much too large an arena which also

  Depending on the nature of the performance there appear to
be three broad patterns of crowd circulation in stands:
(a) static crowd: which exists where the show is continuous or
    even intermittent such as football, rugby and some athletics,
    but without any interrelated diverse activities during the
    interval
(b) circulating crowd: which exists where the show consists of
    several consecutive events with interrelated extra activities
    during the interval between them, and generally associated
    with betting, such as horse racing, dog racing, etc.
(c) a combination o f (a) and (b), where one part of the stand
    could have a static crowd, while the other parts have
    circulating spectators.
Compared with category (a), crowds are smaller and more
leisurely in the other two categories, especially in category (b).
The design criteria, of necessity, will be different, and the facilities
provided by the designer will, of course, have to be compatible
with the requirements of the patrons in each relevant category.

 components of the barriers to the uniformly distributed force
 required to test that category of barrier. As a general principle,                                                                       Dial to register
