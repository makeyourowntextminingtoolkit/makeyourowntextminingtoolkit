                               disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                               Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                               Following a Public Inquiry and Report

                               the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                               Police consulted with the Director or

                               Public Prosections and as a result

                               West Midlands Police ware requested to

                               do a criminal investigation.    This

                               investigation came at the same time

                               that certain members of the public

                               decided to make specific allegations

                               against named police officers and you

                               are one of those officers, and you've

                               already been served with a Regulation

                               6 Notice dealing with those specific

                               complaints.   The nature of those

                                and other matters they raise matters

                                of both a criminal and disciplinary

                                nature, so before you answer any

                                as an ACC.

            WWWJ                Yes at that time I was Assistant Chief

           WWWJ                Yes.

           CC SHARP            So you became ACC Operations and you

           CC SHARP            When did that change?

           WWWJ                That changed in July last year

                               (000789) when I took over from the ACC

                                football, previous football experience.

           WWWJ                 That's right sir.

           CC SHARP             But in total going across that career,

                                experience have you had over the

                                 of course South Yorkshire as as ACC

                                 Operations.

            CC SHARP             Yes.   Before you were ACC though let's

                                 concentrate on that just for a moment.

                                When you were responsible for the

                                policing at Main Road, did you also

                                have a responsible for pre-planning,

                                preparing the operation order, that

                                sort of thing?

           WWWJ                 Yes as Chief Superintendent the the

                                plan was prepared by my Junior

                                Officers but I was responsible for

                                okaying the plan.

           CC SHARP             Okay.    Now while you were ACC

                                Operations in South Yorkshire, could

                                you, again briefly, but as as detailed

                                as you want, but as briefly as

                                possible, can you tell me what your

                                responsibilities were as ACC

                                Operations in South Yorkshire?

           WWWJ                 Yeh.    As, as ACC Operations, I was

                                responsible for operational policing,

                                traffic policing and criminal

                                Yorkshire, what experience did you

                                have of policing football matches at

                              included football matches.

          CC SHARP            Yes, and I think you were responsible

                              either for introducing or certainly

                              introduced?    Would you just have a

          WWWJ                Yes it is sir.

          CC SHARP            Thank you.    Now when were those

                              Standing Instructions produced?

          WWWJ                Well those, when I arrived in South

                              Yorkshire they had Standing

                              Instructions and I updated them as

                              necessary, for example, after the

                              Popplewell Inquiry I updated it and

                              emphasised such things as evacuation.

08.06     CC SHARP            Yes.    When were they last amended

                              then?   Was that the last time they
JACKSON              WALTER


                               were amended after the Popplewell

                               Inquiry?

          WWWJ                 Yes that was the last time they were

                               amended sir.

          CC SHARP             Yes.    Now you produced the Standing

                               Instructions, now what system is

                              employed in South Yorkshire for seeing

                              that those Standing Instructions are

                              conplied with?

          WWWJ                The main system is first of all I, I

                              circulate the Standing Instructions to

                              all Divisional Commanders,

                              Superintendents et cetera.     We have

                              two meetings a year, one at the mid­

                              season and one at the end season with

                              Chief Superintendents and Commanders

                              of football grounds, and we go over

                              the system, discuss what's happened

                              during the season and see whether there

                              is any need for any further amendment.

          CC SHARP            Mm.     When you say we, do you mean you

                              or is it your Ops Department or do you

                              both go?

          WWWJ                Well, when I, when I say we,

                              collectively I mean with the Chief

                              Superintendents, it's a co-operate

                              decision with the Chief Superintendents

                              and the Commanders of the football

                              particular problems or there is a need

                              to update the Standing Instruction

                              then we would do it.

09.17     CC SHARP            Would you be present at that meeting

                              or those meetings?

          WWWJ                Oh yes I'd chair, I'd chair those

                              meetings sir.

          CC SHARP            Thank you.   Were you involved in the

                              planning for the Semi-Final at

                              Hillsborough in 1987 (000087) - that

                              was the Leeds and Coventry match?

          WWWJ                Yes sir, our system of planning is

                              that it's done by the Division

                              concerned and the Chief Superintendent

                              appoints a planning team to work to

                              him.   My Chief Superintendent

                              Operations and Traffic is involved

                              as and where necessary.

          CC SHARP            This was applied in 1987 (000087),

                              we're talking about the 1987 (000087)

                              match ...

          WWWJ                Yes that's right sir.

          CC SHARP            specifically are we?

          WWWJ                And then when the plan is completed it

                              is forward via the Chief Superintendent

                              Ops Traffic to me and I then approve

                              it or give any advice that's necessary.

          CC SHARP            And that would have happened in 1987

                               (000088)?

          WWWJ                Yes I did.    That's the Leeds -

          WWWJ                Yes I did.

          CC SHARP            Any problems?

                              there?

          WWWJ                I didn't sir.

          CC SHARP            Right, but did you receive any reports

                              on it?

          WWWJ                Yes I did.

          CC SHARP            And did those reports reveal any

                              one or two other minor things.

          CC SHARP            Yeh.   The... my, frcm my recollection

                              I think there was a minor pitch

                              invasion on that occasion.

          WWWJ                Yes there was at the end of the game

                              sir.

          CC SHARP            And was that the Liverpool fans that

          CC SHARP            And how was it handled?

          WWWJ                Oh very well.    I think it more or less

                              it was a sort of fairly joyous

                              occasion, didn't cause us any real

                              problems ...

          WWWJ                but the danger is always there but was

                              handled quickly, efficiently, without

                              any real problems.

          CC SHARP            So there weren't any real

                              repurcussions as a result of that?

          WWWJ                No sir.

                              that you did start to think about what

                              we got the AA, we got the Club to pay

                              extra manpower on the perimeter track

                              to ... just in case there was another

                              pitch invasion.    There was something

                              else which I can't quite remember,

                              there was a report by Superintendent

                              required doing it sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.   We, we might come back to that

                              when we start talking about 1989

                              (000089).   But either in 1987 (000087)

                              or in 1988 (000088) were you as ACC

                              Operations aware of any problems on

                              and that sort of thing?

           CC SHARP             Okay.   Do you since then, have you

                                found out if there were any problems

                                of overcrowding, crushing ...

                                the South Yorkshire Police Standing

                               associated with that document there's

                               this South Yorkshire Police memorandum

                               dated the 20th of March (200386) which
13.13                          I'll show you.    It's DPP Document 192

                               because it's associated with that, but

                               do you recognise that document?
          WWWJ                 Yes sir, it was prepared by my

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 He signed that.

          CC SHARP             Fine.    Now it looks to me as though

                               that was prepared after the Popplewell

                               Inquiry, it seems to me that.

          WWWJ                 That's right sir.

          CC SHARP             Would you agree with that?

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             And I think you signed it.

          WWWJ                 I signed and circulated it.

           CC SHARP             Oh I understand, I always wondered

                                where that name came frcm.
           WWWJ                 so we used hi.. his name sir.

           CC SHARP             Thank you.     Now if I can just

                                specifically look at that, I'll let

                                ten there relates to the training of

                                stewards.    Now for the just.... and

                                it's between the two, the two red

          WWWJ                  Yes.

          CC SHARP              and it also talks about to this end it

                                is felt the Police should provide a

                               significant input into the training of

                               stewards.

          WWWJ                 Right.

          CC SHARP             Right.   What significant, significant

                               input into the training of stewards

                               does South Yorkshire Police have?
          WWWJ                 What, what we did and at our met...

                               meetings, I made it quite clear that

                               the club were responsible for the

                               stewards and the training, but clearly

                               because of our expertise we, we had an

                               input and what we did usually at the

                               beginning of the season the Ground

                               Conmander would go to the club and
 JACKSON              WALTER

                                trouble was likely to cur... to occur,

                                how to deal with it, how to deal with

                                particular one that Sheffield

                                and the Fire Brigade also attended, so

                                there was a kind of co-ordination of

                                all services, the Club involvement and,

                                and the stewards.

           CC SHARP             Now is that as a result of 1988

                                (000088) or is that imp., in

                               preparation for 1989 (000089) that

           WWWJ                No that was a, that was a result of

                               the Popplewell Inquiry ...
           CC SHARP            Oh right, I understand that,
           WWWJ                and so it was ongoing since then sir.
16.09      CC SHARP            Now what sort of people frcm the Club

                               were there at that ...?

           WWWJ                Mm, I think the Club Secretary.     I

                               didn't go to it.

           CC SHARP            No.

           WWWJ                The Divisional Ccmmander went and I

                               think the Club Secretary went as well.

           CC SHARP            So the, so the point I'm really trying

                               to get to is that that is the result

                               of the Popplewell recommendations ...

                              was all of them sir.

          CC SHARP             So would you say then that as far as

                              the Popplewell recarmendations, you

                              had sown the seeds in the people who

                              needed to know.

          WWWJ                Oh very much so sir, because not only

                              did I have mid-season and end of

                              also had a meeting with the, the

                              Services attended those meetings

                              because we talked about finance and

                              any other problems, and I always

                              emphasise the need for public safety

                              and any other matters such as, for

                                over the year, over your years as ACC

                                Ops and the Club, have they been

                                receptive to these proposals ...
           WWWJ                 Oh yes, yes sir.

           CC SHARP             inputs?

           WWWJ                 Yes.   I mean, for example, at

                                Sheffield Wednesday we developed a

                                closed-circuit television quite

                                considerably and also they had their

                                own computerised system.   Another

                               development, for example, at one time

                               in Leppings Lane they had not on___

                               they had heme and and away supporters



          CC SHARP             Yes.

17.53     WWWJ                 and eventually I think it was late '86

                               (000086), '87 (000087) they decided to

                               give us Leppings Lane totally ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 for away supporters which was much

                               easier to deal with,

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          CC SHARP             Now could you just tell me how that

                               came into being?

18.46     WWWJ                 Yes.    After, after the Popplewell

                               Inquiry it was quite clear or I felt

                               it was necessary to give seme advice

                               and, and guidance regarding

                               contingency plans for evacuation, and

                               as a result of that my Superintendent

                               Operations, Terry STEWART and I,

                               decided that that's the advice that we

                               would give to all of our officers as

                               guidance in terms of safety for

                               evacuation sir.

          CC SHARP             Yes I understand.

                               Now I don't know whether I've got one
JACKSON              WALTER


                               to hand but you may not need it to

                               refresh your memory, but I do believe

                               that there were very few, if any,

                               amendments made by the Association of

                               Chief Police Officers to you... the

                               drafts put up by South Yorkshire.

          WWWJ                That's right sir, yes ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                that is correct.

          CC SHARP            Okay, thank you very much for that.

19.31                         Now again at page    36 onthat

                              particular and I've highlighted the,

                              the parts I'm going to refer to it

                              talks about stewards should be briefed

                              by a Senior Police Officer prior to

                              every match to ensure that they are

                              aware of their duties and responsib­

                              ilities in event of evacuation or

                              other emergency.    What briefings were

                              given to the stewards prior to the

                              match on the 15th of April 1989

                              (150489)?   Do you know?

          WWWJ                Yes the, the Inspectors who have

                              responsibility for a particular area

                              with the stewards on that area, I

                              know brief.. briefed them in terms of

                              their responsibilities and their

                              duties on that particular day sir.

          CC SHARP            Now what notes would the Inspector
JACKSON              WALTER


                               have with him to help him on that

                               briefing?

           WWWJ                He ... I'm not quite sure what notes

                               he would, he would have sir.    He would

                               be aware of his responsibilities which

                               were written into the Operational

                               Order, so from that he would give the

                               appropriate advice.

          CC SHARP            And would the Inspector, for example,

                              have that somewhere in his locker or

                              or perhaps given to him on the day and

                              he could use that in fact if he wanted

                              to.

20.38     WWWJ                Yes he would be aware of that sir,

                              because I mean that document was, was

                              circulated quite comprehensively.    Our

                              aim always was to make sure that

                              wherever possible regular Inspectors

                              policed the match so they, they would

                              be aware of, of the document.

          CC SHARP            And how do you manage (overtalking) to

                              cope with the promotions and transfers

                              that happen because it's easy to give

                              out a standing instruction to all

                              Inspectors but then they get promoted

                              and others come in don't they.

          WWWJ                I mean the important th... thing there

                              again is the regular meetings that I

                              have with Divisional Commanders and,
JACKSON              WALTER


                               and they would ensure that any,

                               anybody who was promoted would be

                               aware of the Standing Instruction and

                               be aware of what it contains so they

                               could operate it.

          CC SHARP             Okay.    Thank you for that.   Now on

                               page 39 if you could just turn to it,

                               at point 16, it deals there with crowd

                              monitoring and it says, "This should

                              detail what methods exist within the

                              ground to observe and assist in crowd

                              movement for evacuation purposes and

                              should include some closed-circuit

                              and television facilities and the

                              other." Could you tell me in your own

                              words what does that actually mean?

21.54     WWWJ                Yeh basically sir it's all about

                              public safety and it's, it's part and

                              parcel of the evacuation part in the

                              Operational Order and it, it means

                              that the officers should have aware...

                              an awareness of any crowd problems as

                              well as the public order side.

          CC SHARP            Yeh.     Would you agree with me that

                              doesn't really jump out of the page

                              at you though, that message, it deals

                              with evacuation and there are those

                              words at the end and other I think

                              isn't it, "Methods of preserving ...
JACKSON               WALTER


                                a crowd for evacuation purposes."

                                It's just talking about evacuation.
           WWWJ                 Yes it is sir.

           CC SHARP             Yes okay. And then on the same page

                                at 18 under 'Addition Information' and

                                I 1/ I ask you about this just really

                                to test how that is translated into

                                action on the ground.   On page 18

                               under 'Additional Information' it says,

                                "The following points are put forward

                                for consideration:-

                               a) local conditions, for example,

                               whether emergency vehicles can gain

                               access to the stadium.

22.59                          Did you know that on the 15th of April

                               1989 (150489) there was a problem of

                               access for emergency vehicles?

          WWWJ                 Yes I was told about that sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.   So to give me some idea as to

                               how that Standing Orders Standing

                               Instruction is converted into action

                               would you expect your Ground

                               Commanders or your Inspectors or who­

                               ever it is, would you expect anyone

                               to inspect the ground, for example,

                               before a major match, to ensure that

                               the access points are clear?

          WWWJ                 Yes, generally I would expect this sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.   And do you happen to know if
JACKSON              WALTER                                              26


                               that happens?

           WWWJ                I I, I don't six.    All I can say is

                               that the, the guidance is set out

                               there.    What I can say is that on two

                               occasions in last year there was a dry

                               run with the emergency services in, in

                               terms of the response to evacuation.

          CC SHARP             Yes, and who triggered that dry run

                              off?     Was it the Police or ...?

          WWWJ                Well that be the the, the Division did

                              that sir.

          CC SHARP            Right, so it's a test run.

          WWWJ                So it's a test run, yes.

          CC SHARP            Did they do that, you say they did it

                              twice?

          WWWJ                Yes.

24.09     CC SHARP            Did they do that about other aspects

                              of the policing of Hillsborough ...

          WWWJ                In ...

          CC SHARP            to your knowledge?

          WWWJ                In respect of ...

          CC SHARP            Dry runs of any other aspect of it.

          WWWJ                Oh yes I think, I think what they did

                              at Hillsborough, the the Divisional

                              Commander also gave a dry run on his

                              own, looked at the various aspects of

                              the order, in other words you know

                              the fire points ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.




                                                                              1 1 54
JACKSON              WALTER                                              27

           WWWJ                and closed-circuit television, all the

                               other.   They were always on top of it

                               in as much as when we had our meetings

                               we always emphasised the need for

                               safety ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 the need to mate sure that everything

                              was in ortter sir.

          CC SHARP             I understand that.   Now if you turn to

                              page 40 on, I think I've highlighted it

                              again, it specifically relates to

                              stewards at number three, and it says

                              there, "Stewards should be distributed

                              throughout the ground in accordance

                              with a detailed pre-arranged schedule

                              agreed between the police and the

25.06                         management."   Was there any detailed

                              pre-arranged schedule agreed between

                              South Yorkshire Police and the

                              Sheffield Wednesday Club management?

          WWWJ                I think in relation to this the

                              Divisional Commanders took the view

                              that it should be grounds specific.

                              There were changes at every match so

                              clearly they needed to consult with

                              the management of the club at a

                              particular match to decide where to

                              deploy the stewards sir.

          CC SHARP            Are you talking about how many




                                                                              1 155
 JACKSON               WALTER


                                 stewards there would be and where

                                 they would be? (Overtalking)

            WWWJ                 How many stewards there would be,

                                 where they would go et cetera.

            CC SHARP             And, and can you help me as to how

                                 the club would respond to that, I

                                 mean if the local Carmander said, "I

                                 think we'll want fifty stewards today

                                 and I think we'll want them there,"

                                 it would probably would be negotiated.
           WWWJ                  Yes.

                                one, one thing you know from time to

                                were prepared to look at that and take

                                it up so that we got the right

                                stewards.

           CC SHARP             Well I think, I think in fact Mr LOCK

                                was an ex-policeman was he not.
           WWWJ                 He was indeed sir.

                                to look after the stewarding and

                                security.

           WWWJ                 Yes, yeh, and Mr LOCK of course was

                                very keen in relation to that because

                                he had in fact policed Sheffield

                                Wednesday before.

           CC SHARP             So would, can you help me again.     It's

                               probably the Divisional matter but do

                               you happen to know if the negotiation

                               about the stewards numbers and deploy­

                               ments was between the Divisional

                               Commander and Mr LOCK or was it with

                               Mr MACKRELL or or what?

           WWWJ                I, well I think basically it would be

                               Mr with Mr MACKRELL but I think Mr

                               LOCK would be involved as well sir,

                               but I'm not quite a hundred per cent

                               sure.

26.57      CC SHARP            Okay.   Now if you turn to page 42,

                               again we're looking at the Standing

                               Instructions for Policing Football

                               Instructions.   And I think there it

                               talks about the specific duties of

                               stewards, specific duties to be under­

                               taken by stewards include preventing

                               overcrowding, ensuring the crowd

                               limits in various parts of the ground

                               are complied with and that gangways

                               and exits are kept clear.   Was that,

                               before that was put into our Police

                               Instructions, was that ever agreed

                              with the club.

          WWWJ                Yes I think it would be sir, with the

                              Divisional Commander.    I know that at

                              Leppings Lane there was seme I think

                              the Div..., the Divisional Corrmander

                              Mr MOLE agreed that the police would

                              play more of a part there.

          CC SHARP            Mn okay.    Now how would that be

                              reflected back to you or would you not

                              expect it to be?   Would that be a

                              matter that's left on the Division to

                              iron out?

          WMJ                 No it would be a matter for the

                              Division sir.    I think because of the,

                              you know as I said before the ground's

                              specific nature of football matches

                              which are ever changing, you can get

                              an easy match, one that's a bit more

                              difficult et cetera, so it's an

                              ongoing thing all the time and I

                              wouldn't necessarily expect Divisional

                              Conxnanders to report back to me unless

                              they've got a particular problem.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

                             of weight support behind them I was

                             there.

         CC SHARP            Yes.

         WWWJ                An example of that, for example, would

                             be I could give you at Barnsley where

                             they had the, the Police Room behind

                             the stand which was absolutely

                             ludicrous because you couldn't see the

                             ground in the first instance, and I

                             badgered away at that until we get a

                             proper Control Room which overlooks

                             the ground with closed-circuit

                             my role basically was to support the

                             to matters like that where they were

                             having problems.

         CC SHARP            Yes.

           CC SHARP             would have, would have had that?     You

                                 accept that?

           WWW                  Yes I do sir.

           WWWJ                 Yes.

           CC SHARP             Now do you, do you happen to know

                                whether, having got a copy of the

                                Sheffield Wednesday memorandum, did we

                                ever respond to it do you know?     Did

                                we ever argue with it?   Did we accept

                                it? And was it ever incorporated into

                                our planning?

           WWW                  I think how it would be incorporated

                                into our planning would be through

                                their, the briefing at the football

           CC SHARP             Okay.

           WWW                  That's how it would be done.

32.43      CC SHARP             Well we'll cone back to what happens

                                to papers in a moment.   It ... that

                                because of the briefings that go on,

                               but it doesn't seem to me to coincide

                               with what you've been saying in the

                               Standing Instruction.   Would you

                               agree with what I'm saying - it

                               doesn't appear to because it, it's

                               much truncated isn't it?

           WWW                 It is, it is truncated sir, yes, yes.

           CC SHARP            But, I mean if you were now seeing

                               that as ACC Operations from Sheffield

                               Wednesday, what's your reaction to it?

                               Would you accept it or would you want

                               to say I, I'd better get back onto the

                               Club here because it doesn't cover x,

33.23                          it doesn't cover y, it doesn't cover z?

           WWWJ                I think what, what I, I would have

                               done with that is, does it, it goes

                               on here ...

           CC SHARP            What I can tell you is it, it

                               certainly doesn't res... refer, for

                               example, to stewards being on the

                               terraces or at the back of the crowd,

                               it doesn't refer to the stewards

                               being responsible for packing and ...

                              seems to me if that's the perception

                              of the work of the stewards of the

                              Club, it doesn't coincide with our

                              perception or the Police perception.

         WWWJ                That that's right, there, there is a

                              difference in perception there.    All

                              I can say in relation to that sir is

                              that the, you know, the Divisional

                              Ccrrmander is well aware of the the

                              ACPO guidelines ...

         CC SHARP            Yes.

         WWWJ                in relation to stewarding and so he

                              would, he would operate in relation to

                              that.   Having said that they, they are

                              only guidelines.   Now it might be that

                              the Divisional Corrmander, for reasons

                             of his own, would make an agreement

                             with the club because it might be the

                             best way to deal with the situation,

                             and I think the important thing in all

                             of our orders, all of our contingency

                             plans, is a degree of flexibility ...

 34.43     CC SHARP             Okay.    So to wrap all that up if I

                                can, what as the Semi-Final for the

                                15th of April last year (150489) drew

                                near, what was your expectation as ACC

                               Ops, about what would be done about

                                stewarding on the day?

          WWW                  Well, I would expect the Divisional

                               Commander to liaise with the Club in

                               terms of the number of stewards that

                               were being provided, that on the day

                               in question there would be discussions

                               with the Secretary, in terms of how

                               they would be de... deployed, what we

                               would actually be doing.    The briefing

                               then would take place with Inspectors

                               so that we are well aware of their

                               responsibilities sir, so it's a none,

                               it's a short period of time of course

                               with semi-final ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 You haven't got a lot of time to

                               prepare the plan, but there would be

                               ongoing liaison between the Divisional

                               Commander and the Club, the Planning

                               Team and the Club, to make sure that

                               the stewards were well aware of their

35.46     CC SHARP             Okay.    So again your expectation of




                                                                               1 1 66

                               the stewarding on the day was that

                               they would be responsible for crowd

                               monitoring and crowd packing if I can

                               use the word, distribution.

           rnwj                Yes, yes.    I think you know having

                               said that, it's always a, it's always

                               a combination that as well, you know

                               police officers are there, you know

                               they have a special responsibility if

                               they see anything wrong ...

           CC SHARP            Yeh.

           WWWJ                they would deal with it, and all our,

                               all our officers were, are well aware

                               of that necessity.

           CC SHARP            Okay.   Perhaps, perhaps we'll cone

                               back to that in a minute.    But I want

                               to be fairly clear, your expectation

                               was though that the prime

                               responsibility in respect of the

                               prevention of the overcrowding in

                               terms of monitoring and distributing

                               the crowd, was the Club's.

           WWWJ                That's right sir.

           CC SHARP            Thank you.   Now I suppose now it's a

                               question you should never ask but,

                               with the benefit of hindsight, do you

                               think the stewarding lived up to your

                               expectations on the day?

36.42      WWWJ                It's a difficult one that sir without,




                                                                              11 67

                                 without having had control of the match

                                 itself without being the, the Commander

                                 but if if you ask me in the general

                                 sense I would say no.   I would think it

                                 could have been better ...

            CC SHARP            Okay.

           WWMJ                 but I wouldn't like to be over-critical

                                 in relation to that.

           CC SHARP             But I think it's, I think it's

                                 important your perception as the

                                operational top man as it were, is

                                important.   If you don't think they

                                lived up to our expectations, where

                                would we then cast our net to find out

                                why it wasn't?   I mean is it the role

                                of the Divisional Commander to make

                                sure the stewards knew what they were

                                up to and what they should be doing,

                                or do you think the Club, perhaps Mr

                                IOCK or whoever, should have been much

                                more positive in saying this is what

                                the stewards need to do, whatever?

           WWWJ                 I think possibly on the day that

                                everybody did their, their best under

                                the circumstances sir.   I mean I think

                                that's what I would say overall.

           CC SHARP             In terms of the briefing?

37.38      WWWJ                 In terms of the briefing, yeh.     The

                                                                                 1 1 68

                                brief the stewards ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                and brief than with clarity in teems

                                of their responsibilities.   I think on

                                the day in question everybody was

                                faced with a difficult situation.      Now

                                stewards of course are not police

                                officers ...

           CC SHARP            You're right.

           WWWJ                so they face an even more difficult

                                situation and I would say that

                                basically everybody probably did the

                                best that they could sir.

           CC SHARP            Okay.   Do you think then there was any

                                flavour about '89 (000089), because

                                '88 (000088) had ostensibly gone so

                               well, basically it was a carb...

                               There were seme minor amendments which

                               we'll talk about in a minute, but

                               basically it was a carbon copy of the

           WWWJ                Yes it was but that would basically

                               was because we had virtually the same

                               information and so the plan, whilst it

                               was basically a carbon copy with

                               slight amendments, was based on the

                               information and intelligence that we

                               back to the, the where we started

                               really.     What is the system in South

                              Yorkshire Police for the preparation

                              of the Operation Order for the Semi-

                              Final at Hillsborough?

          WWWJ                What, what happens is sir, that we,

                              we have a Planning Team and it's

                              always basically the, the same

                              Planning Team and the, the person

                              responsible for running the operation

                              and preparing it is the Superintendent

                              on the Sub-Division.     He has got the

                              special responsibi1ity for ensuring

                              that the plan is completed properly.

                              The Chief Inspector and the Chief

                              Inspector in this particular case is

                              David BEAL and he plays a leading

                              part, David BEAL, and so he does it on

                              a regular basis with the Football

                              they prepare the plan ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                so they've built up quite a tremendous

                              expertise and knowledge as to what's

                              required in terms of any, any plan at

                               Commander ought to be freed from

                               just a bit about that?

          WWWJ                Yes, yes I could tell you about that

                              sir, we we, we were always looking for,

                              looking to make the !plan more

                              effective and develop it, it's always

                              been you know part of our job that and

                              what we did is after running the Leeds

                              - Coventry ...

          CC SHARP            Eighty-seven (000087).

          WWWJ                Eighty-seven (00008")) Semi-Final we

                              felt possibly the Divisional Conmander

                              had too much on his plate in looking

                              after all of the traffic side and so

                              what we did we developed a separate

                              traffic plan in, in the following year,

                              and then it was fully operative the

                              next year where the Chief

                              Superintendent Ops Traffic was solely

                              responsible for the traffic.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                I mean there was still the link

                              between the, you know in terms of




                                                                        1 171

                              communication between the traffic and

                              the Divisional Conmander, so that you

                              be aware of what any problems were so

                              if there was a delay, for example, he

                              would be aware of that but we

                              separated that out so it was much

                              easier for him to police the football

                              match.

41.08     CC SHARP            Is there a danger with that and I talk

                              now with my ACPO hat on now?    Isn't

                              there a danger with that - I can see

                              all the benefits.   I mean you've got

                              a Chief Superintendent in charge of

                              traffic, you've got a Chief

                              Superintendent in charge of city

                              centre, you've got a Chief Inspector

                              in charge of the ground and it's

                              environment, but isn't there a danger

                              that there's no bossman and that

                              conflicts and confusions can arise.

          WWWJ                No I, we didn't think so sir and we,

                              we discussed it when we actually ran

                              it with the, the Commanders concerned



          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and they were quite happy about it,

                              about that, and it, it didn't cause

                              any, it didn't cause any confusion at

                              all.   In fact what we thought it did
           WALTER


                     it eased his, it eased his workload in

                    terms of concentrating on the ground



CC SHARP            Yes.

WWWJ                and his surroundings as opposed to the

                    traffic, and certainly it would have

                    been much, it would have been

                    difficult for him to control the city

                    centre (interruption) that that ...

CC SHARP            So basically sitting on top of that is

                    the Force Control Room really because



WWWJ                Yes.

CC SHARP            all three are at the end to that,

                    there's no separate Control Box for

                    the traffic, no separate Control Box

                    for the city centre or there's the

                    local Sub-Divisional Commander ...

WWWJ                That's right.

CC SHARP            but the Force Control Roam is really

                    co-ordinating the communication of

                    that.

WWWJ                Yes that's right sir.

CC SHARP            Okay, I understand that.   Thank you

                    very much for that.   And I think you

                    said that was the system which was in

                    operation, or certainly not the split

                    control, but the planning process was

                    the same in '87 (000087), '88 (000088),

            WWWJ                 Yes that's right sir.

            CC SHARP             Now I think ...

            DCI 2514             We've got two minutes sir.

 42.30      CC SHARP             Thank you.   We've got about two

                                minutes before we need to change the

                                tape.   Now I think we can talk about

                                the Football Liaison Officer.

           WWWJ                 Right sir.

           CC SHARP             Now I know his role about him getting

                                information - intelligence.     Do you

                                happen to know what he actually did

                                this time prior to the 1989 (000089)

                                Semi-Final.

           WWWJ                 Yes we, we also have an Intelligence

                                Officer and what we do is we gather

                                via the ACPO guidelines all the

                                information and intelligence regarding

                                the, the, both clubs as to what the

                                likely problems are ... and as a

                                result of all of that intelligence it

                                forms part and parcel (buzzer) of the,

                                the order.

           CC SHARP             Well I think that is a good point just

                                to stop so we change the tape.    We're

00.40     CC SHARP             Thank you.   We were talking at the

                               conclusion of the last tape about the

                               Semi-Final in 1989 (000089).   When I

                               was reading seme of the transcripts of

                               the Public Inquiry it did seem to me

                               in fact sent the Intelligence Officer

                               across to Merseyside.   I'm not sure

                              unusual because there was a match in

                              and Liverpool and I think they brought

                              there was little trouble there and,

                              and so part and parcel of the, the

                              borne out by that particular match,

                              so that we, we didn't expect any,

                              any real problems from either, from

                              either club.

          CC SHARP            Yes.   I think at the Inquiry, there

                              were questions placed at various

                              police officers saying were you aware

                              of the York match and were you aware

                              of it. (Interruption)    Do you think

                              they were relevant?




                                                                             1 176

           WWWJ                Well not, well not, not really sir,

                               because I think basically we, we

                               depend on the, on the police forces

                               concerned regarding intelligence and

                              what the likely problems are.    I mean

                               I think that's where the main
02.52                          information comes from.   We, we had a,

                              a brief prepared by the Intelligence

                              Officer who was a very experienced

                              officer, the Detective Sergeant .,.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                Who ...

          CC SHARP            Is that CHARLESWORTH?

          WWWJ                CHARLESWORTH ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                who actually did it - experienced man

                              and he did the intelligence in the

                              pre..., the previous year and so that,

                              that intelligence was accepted ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and I think coupled with the match in

                              January which showed a very low, a low

                              key picture, we accepted what the

                              intelligence was.

          CC SHARP            Yes.   So although perhaps you didn't

                              get as much information as sent to you

                               that?

          WWWJ                 I'm very happy with the intelligence

                               system sir, yes.

          CC SHARP             It's not at the... cause it's not only

                               information from other sources, I

                              understand that in South Yorkshire,

                               for example, there's a Headquarter's

                              Policy file and there's also a

                              Divisional Policy file on Policing.

          WWWJ                Yes.

03.56     CC SHARP            Would those two files contain relevant

                              data about problems in the past at

                              Hillsborough?

          WWWJ                Yes they would but all, all the

                              information would be available from

                              the Policy files that we, we required

          WWWJ                to, to police the match, yes.

          CC SHARP            And without referring to any

                              a Divisional Commander who's got a

                              semi-final coming at Hillsborough,

                              who's going to be in charge of the

                              two files?

          WWWJ                Yeh, he would have access to those

                              files sir.

          CC SHARP            Would he have to ask for them or would

                              he, would they be sent to him?

          WWWJ                 If, if he required than they would be

                              we, what we actually do in is if

                              matches vary from season to season and

                              that's why the ACPO system was set up



          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                in order so that we could get the

                              intelligence, the information required

                              that was current at the time.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

04.52     WWWJ                You you would, you would find, for

                              example, in my experience, that if you

                              went back three years the intelligence

                              on a particular club would be different

                              to the current year.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                Take Millwall, for example, now that

                              Club has turned completely round, so

                              you deal with the intelligence based

                              on the, the latest information.

          CC SHARP            What about Liverpool though and that's

                              a case in point?

                              would expect the latest current

                               were behaving.

          CC SHARP             And, and did you, do you happen to

                               know if in 1989 (000089) in the build

                               up to the match, did you get an...

                               any information from Merseyside about

                              expected large numbers of late

                              arrivals or did you get any

                               information about expected large

                              numbers of people arriving without

                              tickets or that sort of thing?

05.45     WWWJ                No we didn't sir.   There is, there was

                              an intelligence brief ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                prepared, I mean we had the, the City

                              Order for Policing the Match, and also

                              an intelligence brief ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and that was very low key sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes okay.   I think, how much, how much

                              store, how much emphasis would you as

                              the ACC Ops place on the experience of

                              past matches at Hillsborough?    How

                              important was it or is it something

                              are the past matches at Hillsborough

                              something which we can say, we deal

                              with that our system is such that we

                              debrief, we identify the problems, we




                                                                             1 1 80

                                put it right and we can start again?

                                Is it worth, for example, a new

                                Divisional Commander coming in and

                                saying, "I'd like to know what

                                happened in 1981 (000081) or I'd like

                                (000087)."     I mean what's your view on

                                that as the ACC Ops?

           WWWJ                 It's it's, that information is always

                                worth knowing but what I would

                                emphasise sir is the the, the

                                important aspect is the current

                                intelligence and the current informa­

                               tion.

           CC SHARP            Yes.

           WWWJ                You know so that as, as games are

                               progressing throughout the year ...

           CC SHARP            Yes.

           WWWJ                you perhaps might go back to last year

                               of course as well ...

           CC SHARP            Yes.

           WWWJ                and look    at theinformation there.

           CC SHARP            Yes.

07.04      WWWJ                But if     I go back to theMillwall case,

                               for example, if you actually policed

                               Millwall Football Ground the same way

                               you policed it four years, then you

                               would be expending a lot of resources

                               that you didn't require ...




                                                                            1181

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 so the important thing is that the

                                current intelligence and information

                                to deal with that particular club.

                                I think that's the important aspect

                               sir.

          CC SHARP             Yes.     Okay let me, let me approach it

                               another way then, I understand what

                               you're saying.    Were you aware that in

                               the 1981 (000081) Semi-Final at

                               Hillsborough there'd been a crushing

                               problem at the Leppings Lane end?

07.39     WWWJ                 Yeh, I was generally aware of that

                               sir, yes.

          CC SHARP             Right.    Now how were you aware of that?

          WWWJ                 Basically I think there was a report

                               on file and it, it was mentioned by

                               one or two people that they, they had

                               this incident in 1981 (000081).

          CC SHARP             Right.    Now once you'd become aware of

                               it, does your curiosity go then one

                               stage and then said I wonder what they

                               did about it?

          WWWJ                 Oh yes sir ...

          CC SHARP             So what did they do about the crushing

                               (overtalking) ...

          WWWJ                 Well what what, what they did in 1981

                               (000081) is they put arterial fences

                               in to prevent the type of situation




                                                                           1 I 82

                              that occurred there ... I can't ...

          CC SHARP             I'm looking at the map which is in, in

          CC SHARP            Those are the fences ...

08.31     WWWJ                Those yes sir.    They put in I, if I

                              understand it those radial fences and

                              also I think they up'd the number of

                              police officers be... because they,

                              they had a problem in as much as you

                              had fans, away fans with home fans

                              together there.

          CC SHARP            In the West Stand or on the terraces?

          WWWJ                In the, in the, on the terraces ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and I think on the West Stand as well

                              and so they up'd the number of police

                              officers in terms of segregation ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                both there and behind in the concourse

                              as they came in and also I think they

                              put one or two more policemen on the




                                                                              1 1 33

                              perimeter.

          CC SHARP            Okay.

          WWWJ                So those were the main aspects to deal

                              with that situation.    But having said

                              that what we did ...

          CC SHARP            This is ...

          WWWJ                we worked on that with Brian MOLE who

                              is a Divisional Ccmmander and when

                              Graham MftCKRELL came, who is the

                              present Secretary, he agreed that that

                              would be all given over to the away

                              fans sir, so it was much easier to

                              control then.

09.37     CC SHARP            Now that sounds to me like a solution

                              to solve a segregation problem.

          WWWJ                Mm.

          CC SHARP            The problem as I understand it in '81

                              (000081) was one of overcrowding.

          WWWJ                Right.

          CC SHARP            Now did the Club address the problem

                              of overcrowding?    Did we have any view

                              on the overcrowding which had occurred

                              in '81 (000081) for example, and I'm

                              exploring the system now ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            in South Yorkshire?

          WWWJ                Yes.    Well perhaps if I could explain

                              what happened in terms of the system,

                              there is a Safety Garmitee sir, which

                               consists of the, the responsible

                               Safety Officer from the local

                               authority, the Fire Brigade and the

                              Police and they would be responsible

                               for arty other alterations that might

                              occur.   That's how the system works.

          CC SHARP             I understand that,

          WWWJ                and ... (interruption)

          CC SHARP            That's for the purposes of the Safety

                              Certificate?

          WWWJ                The Safety Certificate, so we, we would

                              work in accordance with that, that

                              that's how the system works.

          CC SHARP            I understand that.

10.33     WWWJ                And as a result of the, the radial

                              fences going in, I think this was

                              considered to have resolved the

                              problem as such in terms of the

                              incident that occurred in 1981 (000081)



          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and there was this additional part of

                              the, the segregation that you've

                              mentioned ...

          CC SHARP            I understand that.

          WWWJ                and that was, we worked at that for

                              seme time.

          CC SHARP            Yes.   Now you've got a a, a fairly

                              good working knowledge now of '81




                                                                             1 1 85

                              expect the Divisional Commander who's

                              going to police Hillsborough to have

                              that sort of knowledge?

          WWWJ                Not, not necessarily so sir, in as

          WWWJ                and look at the situation.

          CC SHARP            Well this might help that answer a bit

                              more.    Do you have any system in South

          WWWJ                 Yeh, yeh.   One of the things I had

                               they were at the same place, would

                               identify the people concerned, so

                              specifically to the '89 (000089) Semi-

                              Final.     When did you first learn that

                              the 1989 (000089 FA Cup Semi-Final was

                              to be staged at Hillsborough?     Can

                              you recall?

          WWWJ                Yeh I think it's in me statement if

                              I'm, correct me if I'm right sir, it

                              was the, the 20th of March I think ...

          CC SHARP            Would you like to ...

          WWWJ                and I happened to be in Brian MXE's

                              office when he got a call in relation

                              to it sir. (Overtalking)

          CC SHARP            Please have that in front of you if

                              you want it.

          WWWJ                Right sir.     Yeh 20th of March sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.     And did you know at that time

                              that Mr MDLE was about to be moved to

                              Barnsley I think?

15.15     WWWJ                Yes I think we already knew at that

                              time sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes,. And, and did you know at that

                              time that Mr DUCKENFIELD was to be the

                              new Mr MDLE on the ... ?

          WWWJ                Yes it had been, it had been discussed.

          CC SHARP            Right.




                                                                              1 1 90

           WWWJ                What what, what I did in relation to

                               that is in the initial stages Brian

                              MDLE, the Chief Superintendent there,

                              prepared the skeleton of the ...

          CC SHARP            Okay I'll cone to that in a second,

                              and now we, so we know Mr MDLE is

                              going, we know we've got Hillsborough

                              and it's a semi-final, we know Mr

                              DUCKENFIELD is caning in.   At that

                              time did you know that Mr DUCKENFIELD's

                              experience with Hillsborough was about

                              ten years old, although he'd been

                              doing Bramall Lane I think in the

                              meantime?

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            His certainly, his experience of

                              Hillsborough was about ten years old

                              I think.

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            Yeh.   So you obviously know the

                              question I'm caning to is, did it

16.02                         occur to you that it might have been

                              prudent to let Mr MDLE police the

                              event on the 15th of April (150489)

                              with perhaps Mr DUCKENFIELD by his

                              side or not even there perhaps.

          WWWJ                Well I think there's two aspects to

                              that sir.   In, in the service we're

                              always subject to being promoted in

                              dealing with major incidents.     David

                              DUCKENFIELD was a very experienced

                              Divisional Comnander, he had the city

                              centre, Sheffield United ground.       He

                              was aware of Sheffield Wednesday and

                              I'm quite sure had he felt that it

                              was necessary to have Brian MDLE

                              assisting, he would have asked but he

                              was quite confident about it.    He had

                              the same team round him as the

                              previous year and so the the, there

                              wasn't a problem envisaged in relation

                              to that.     I also arranged through

                              Brian MDLE that initially before he

                              was promoted at the first meeting that

                              David would go there and share the

                              experiences with Brian MDLE in terms

                              of the number of people that were

                              there, the planning, what they would

                              do et cetera ...

          CC SHARP            Okay.

          WWWJ                so you ...

17.15     CC SHARP            Wiell let's, let's lead into that then.

                              So you were happy with Mr DUCKENFIELD

                              taking on the Mr MDLE, going off to

                              his new Division?

          WWWJ                Yes sir.

          CC SHARP            One other thing about that of course

                              is that newly promoted Chief




                                                                               1 1 92

                               Superintendent would have been quite

                               euphoric about his promotion - it's a

                              very important step in a man's career,

                              to be promoted Chief Superintendent.

                              Do you think it's likely that a newly

                              promoted Chief Superintendent is going

                              to say to his ACC Ops, "Well I don't

                              really think I can cope on this

                              occasion, perhaps Mr M       " I mean I

                              think that's asking a lot isn't it.

          WWWJ                Well I think we try to, what we

                              operate an open and frank policy in,

                              in South Yorkshire sir ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and the meetings that we have all, all

                              my Divisional Ccnmanders know that

                              they can say what they want to me in

                              relation to that so I, I don't think



          CC SHARP            Okay right.

          WWWJ                I don't that prevails sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay, so you were just about to start

                              talking to me about the planning.

                              Once you know that you've got the

                              match and you know Mr MDLE's going,

                              you know Mr DUCKENFIELD's coming in.

                              Now you, you were starting to say so

                              you got Mr MDLE to do certain things

                              to get the thing off the ground.




                                                                             1 193

 18.21    WWWJ                Yes, he he, he looked at it initially

                              and sort of prepared the skeleton of

                              the plan ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and then very quickly because we we're

                              moving quickly from the date as you

                              can see ...

          WWWJ                the 15th of March (150389) to the 15th

                              of April (150489).    It's not long to

                              prepare the plan.    I arranged with

                              Brian, Brian MDLE, that David

                              DUCKENFIELD would go across to the

                              meeting to the first meeting he had ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                so he'd be in right at the start in

                              terms of the, the development of the

                              operational plan.    That was then

                              carried on by the Planning Team which

                              was Chief Inspector BEALE, Inspector

                              SEWELL and overseen closely by

                              be Mr DUCKENFIELD, and so the plan was

                              developed by the same team ...

19.16     CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                that did the plan the previous year

                              sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.   And then having got Mr MDLE to,

                              to start the process off, then can

                              you just talk me through, briefly if

                              you like, the planning stages which

                              then followed?

          WWWJ                Yes, the the..., there were a number

                              of meetings sir.     The first one was

                              with the various the services there,

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and so there was a discussion on, on

                              the match itself, the routes, all the

                              usual information.

          CC SHARP            Would the Club be there at that time?

          WWWJ                I, I'm not sure whether the Club were

                              at that particular one but what would

                              happen there Inspector SEWELL and

                              Chief Inspector BEALE would closely

                              liaise with the Club in relation to

                              the development sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                So the Club would be kept well and

                              truly in the picture.

          CC SHARP            Okay.

                              They would work through the various

                              matters concerning it, the number of

                              resources, for example, they wanted

                              more horses and more dogs which I

                              agreed and approved, and that's how

                              the planning was worked through sir.

                              done by the people on the Division ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

21.35     WWWJ                so I wouldn't be involved in the, in

                              the nitty gritty of the planning ...

          CC SHARP            Yes I understand that.

          WWWJ                It's never done that way, I don't

                              think it's done ...

          CC SHARP            Okay.    Now if I, if I can just show

                              you that.    Does that look like the

                              plan?    I'm showing Mr JACKSON DPP

                              Document 194.    Is that the final

                              Operation Order as you remember it?

          WWWJ                Yes it is sir.

          CC SHARP            Now although you don't sign it, do

                              you actually have to give your

                              approval to that before it is, is

                              finalised?

          WWWJ                Yes.    What what, what actually happens

                              is that when the plan's prepared they

                              send it via Chief Superintendent Ops up

                              to me and then I look at the plan.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                If I wasn't satisfied with it then I'd

                              ring the Divisional Commander and say

          CC SHARP            Okay.

                              the blurred, it's just the first

                               appendix I think.     There's a signature

                              right.     I think is that Appendix Al?

          WWWJ                Yes sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.     Were you satified that the

                              duties and areas of responsibility of

                              the senior officers.     I'll call them

                              the Ground Commanders if I can.

          WWWJ                Yes, yes sir.

          CC SHARP            Do you think they're clear and

                              unambiguous?

          WWWJ                Yes I do.

          CC SHARP            Are you happy with that?

          WWWJ                Yes I am sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.    Now from that plan can you tell

                              me what were to be the duties and

                              areas of responsibility of

                              Superintendent GREENWOOD, for example,

                              in general terms?

          WWWJ                Well Superintendent GREENWOOD was

                              Ground Catmander inside the ground and

                              also had responsibility for the

                              turnstiles sir.

          CC SHARP            Right.    And what were the duties and

                              areas of responsibility for

                              Superintendent MARSHALL?

          WWWJ                Sup... Superintendent MARSHALL had,




                                                                                1 1 93

                              was Ground Comtvander outside the

                              ground and Superintendent CHAPMAN had

                              the Kop end - that's the Notts Forest

                              end sir.

23.33     CC SHARP            Now when you say Mr GREENWOOD is the

                              Ground Ccmnander inside the ground,

                              can you give roe a boundary line?   Was

                              his area and responsibility up to the

                              iron perimeter gates for example,

                              outside the turnstiles?

          WWWJ                Oh just to the, just to the turnstiles

                              sir.

          CC SHARP            Just up to the turnstiles?    It

                              presents me with this problem as an

                              outsider looking at that, although

                              I've now got quite a lot of knowledge

                              of it but that Operational Order

                              presents me this problem.    If you look

                              at Serial 16, 17, 18 and 19, they're

                              the turnstile serials ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            and they've got responsibilities of

                              searching and making sure implements

                              and weapons aren't brought in, that

                              drunks don't get in, that no non­

                              ticket holders don't climb over.

                              They've also got the problem of

                              controlling orderly queues outside the

                              turnstiles.   Now I would say to you

                              going back to my original question,

24.25                         isn't that, could that not be seen as

                              a confusing overlap between Mr

                              GREENWOOD who's penned inside the

                              ground and Mr MARSHALL who's outside

                              the ground, and there's that no man's

                              land where ...

          WWWJ                Well yeh, not really sir, because

                              we've got a Chief Inspector of course

                              in charge there as well ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                who's an experienced officer.     The,

                              the overlap may in fact pro... produce

                              seme some good in as much as both

                              Superintendent, Mr MARSHALL was well

                              aware of what his responsibilities ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and in fact an, an agreement at with

                              Mr GREENWOOD that he would come up to

                              that particular area, so you've got

                              two Superintendents there who could if

                              necessary meet and discuss any

                              particular problems.

          CC SHARP            But how would you know as the ACC Ops

                              who's got to give his final approval

                              to that plan, how would you know

                              they've come to that agreement?

          WWWJ                I think if I could go back to the,

                              the serials themself ...




                                                                            1200

           CC SHARP             Yes.

25.29      WWWJ                 each serial had they'd, they'd got a

                                Chief Inspector in charge.   Now I

                               wouldn't necessarily know that Mr

                               GREENWOOD, wherever Mr GREENWOOD would

                               be sir, but I would know that they

                               were all involved in the briefing, they

                               were briefed by the Divisional

                               Comnander, so the Divisional Commander

                               would be pointing out areas of

                               responsibility and where everybody was

                               so Mr MARSHALL and Mr GREENWOOD would

                               be well aware of their responsibilities

                               and what the order contained.



          CC SHARP             Yes.

                               I can't leave that unchallenged

                               because we actually have a verbatim

          CC SHARP             I do know from other sources that Mr

                                did Mr DUCKENFIELD know that as the

                              I'm convinced anyway that it didn't

                              play too much of a role, if any at

          CC SHARP            Now you talked to me about you giving

                              approve that order for the 1989

           CC SHARP            No, but how how, could you guess or

                               could you estimate for me how many

                               days before the kick-off for exanple.

          WWWJ                 Oh yes, yes, it was quite a few days

                               before the kick-off that I got the

28.27     CC SHARP             Yes.

          CC SHARP             And you would have approved the order

                               for the previous year, the 1988

          WWWJ                 Yes I did sir.

          CC SHARP             Now I think is the time really we

                               could talk just perhaps about what the

                               amendments were from ... 1988 (000088)

                               to 19...   Could you just outline those

          WWWJ                 Well one thing we picked up was the

                               improved the traffic signs.    There was

                              thing we did.

                              can't remember them off hand.

          CC SHARP            Of all of those things that you did

                              were as a result of lessons learned

                              from '88 (000088) were they?

          WWWJ                Yes they were sir.   We picked those up

                                the circumstances that you know changed

                               area and by the turnstile area I mean

                               between the turnstiles and the iron

                               perimeter gates.   Now I'm pointing to

35.27                          the map and I'm pointing to the

                               Turnstiles 1 to 8, 9 to 16 and A to G,

                               and the dotted line which represents

                               the iron perimeter fence.   Now I think

                               you agreed at the Public Inquiry it

                               was important to control that ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             and for, to try and prevent it from

                               becoming congested.

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             Now is that why you've got these

                               serials there to ensure orderly queues

                               and control the queues?

          WWWJ                 Yes it is sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.   Now I think again from the

                               transcript at the Public Inquiry you
JACKSON               WALTER


                                agreed that it was important to

                                provide seme sort of filter system

                                outside the turnstile area and I

                                presume by that we mean there some­

                               where ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             or there somewhere in that area and

                                I'm pointing to the map and I'm waving

                               my hand from the turnstile line out

                               through the iron perimeter fence into

                               lappings Lane, and I think you agreed

                               at the Public Inquiry it could be

                               important to provide sane sort of

                               filtering ...

36.24     P METCALF            Should we have a look at the reference

                               and the transcript, should we have a

                               at the reference?

          CC SHARP             Yes by all means.   Here it is.

                               Do you recall that part of it?     I put

                               highlights on there to try and draw

                               your attention to it.   Please take all

36.44                          the time you want. (Pause)

37.03                          There's an awful lot of it. Just while

                               you're looking at that I was going to

                               say I think you rejected the idea of

                               putting barriers across Leppings Lane

                               and you rejected one or two other

                               suggestions which were put to you, but

                               I think you agreed with the principle
JACKSON              WALTER                                             84


                              that if you are to keep that area free

                               from congestion there's got to be seme

                              control ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            keeping them in there.

          WWWJ                Yes sir.

          CC SHARP            Now the point I'm putting to you is

                              that Leppings Lane isn't there a

                              natural barrier in that we've got the

                              perimeter gates, the iron perimeter

                              gates?

          WWWJ                That's right sir, yes.

          CC SHARP            Now I think it was put to you in that

                              Public Inquiry that if the police

37.37                         managed to maintain a crocodile of

                              people coming down the pavement and

                              I'm pointing to the map in the

                              interview room, I'm pointing down the

                              the that would be the eastern pavement

                              of Leppings Lane coning down,

                              travelling south towards the turnstile

                              end.   I think that was put to you in

                              the Public Inquiry was it ...

          WWWJ                Yes it was sir.

          CC SHARP            If you could have a crocodile there

                              and you had a filter system here, you

                              could control the crowd in that

                              turnstile area outside.

          WWWJ                Yes, yes.

          CC SHARP            Now what di... would you like to

                              explain to roe.   Do you, what do you

                              think about that as a proposition?

          WWWJ                It depends very much on the

                              circumstances.    With some crowds it

                              might be possible to keep 'em in there

                              but it depends on the numbers, then

                              you've got problems.    I mean if, if

                              you go to any football match, a big

                              one, and go to any particular street

                              you'll see hoards of supporters coming

                              down filling the street.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

38.34     WWWJ                You're then talking about a large

                              number of police officers to try and

                              push 'em into a crocodile line, and

                              you could in fact sort of col... cause

                              problems by doing that but people

                              don't want to go and tie up a lot of

                              police officers so it's a difficult

                              situation and one that can only be

                              decided upon by the officers who are

                              there are at the time who would take

                              note of the numbers of people who are

                              there ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          mm                  and the feasibility of doing it sir.

          CC SHARP            Well but, but we had very little

                              intelligence to suggest there was




                                                                            1213

                                                  ?

          WWWJ                That's right sir.

          CC SHARP            and that there was going to be any­

          WWWJ                That's right sir.

          CC SHARP            You had the experience of '88 (000088)

                              behind you and there didn't seem to be

                              any problem.

          WWWJ                Yes.

39.16     CC SHARP            I mean the question I'm coining to is

                              do you think that those serials and

                              mounted deployed there, given the

                              state of art which ^?as the

                              intelligence you'd got and the

                              experience of '88 (000088).   Do you

                              think they were sufficient to ever to

                              have adopted such a scheme of making

                              sure there was a nice orderly corridor,

                              that there was some filtering in and

                              orderly queues kept?

          WWWJ                Certainly in, in normal circumstances

                              like '88 (000088) that, that would

                              have been possible and the numbers

                              there.   I think we were talking about

                              sev... about seventy officers there,

                              and also a number of mounted officers




                                                                             1214

          CC SHARP            And do you think - sorry.

          WWWJ                Having said- I was going to say and

                              having said all that I'd go back to

                              do that in any circumstances because

                              you can go to, you can go to grounds

                              and you can see hoards of people

                              to do.

          CC SHARP            Yes.     But on the state of the

                              intelligence you had and the

                              information, do you think that those

                               would add a caveat sir, it they're

                               they may be certain times when there

           WWWJ                now bearing in mind how much traffic

                               he has ...,

           CC SHARP            Yeh.

           WWWJ                what the reaction of the crowd is, is

                               it, is it a peaceable crowd, are they

                               behaving themself.

           CC SHARP            Yes.

           WWWJ                Is there, is there danger to oth...

                               otter, you know other people.     So

                               those decisions really have got to be

                               flexible on the day so you can make an

                               appropriate decision.     I don't think

                               you can say yes let the traffic run

                               or close it.     I think you can say

                               depending on the circumstances and

                               what the, what the Ground Commander

                               thinks in terms of public safety all

                               around sir.

42.06      CC SHARP            Yes okay.     So I think you agreed with

                               me, I think you agreed with me, and if

                               you didn't please ... but it is

                               important to try mid keep that

                               congestion free ...

          WWWJ                Yes it is.

          CC SHARP            there ...

          WWWJ                Yes it is sir.

          CC SHARP            outside the turnstiles ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            behind them and, and the propostion

                              I'm putting to you is, there is a

                              barrier there, it's called the iron

                              perimeter gates ...

          WWWJ                That's right sir.

          CC SHARP            And that could be used to keep that

                              congestion free.

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            Now with the officers they had there

                              deployed and given that there was no

                              untowards intelligence, the expereince

                              of '88 (000088) was good, do you think

                              there was enough officers there to, to

                              do that?

          WWWJ                Ee I'm satisfied there was sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.

          WWJ                 Absolutely.

42.48     CC SHARP            Would you be surprised if I was to say

                              to you they didn't because in 1988

                              (000088) we have the video film of it

                              and I'll show it to you if you like.

                              In 1988 (000088) we have the video

                              film which shows that those gates were

                              closed at 11 o'clock (1100) in the




                                                                            1218

                               morning and were never opened again

                                'till after kick-off and that the

                               crowd was allowed in at one point

                               there and one point here, and that

                               there were policemen there filtering

                               the crowd in and the video shows that

                               there was no congestion built up in

                               that area.   Now I've also got the 1989

                                (000089) video which shows that those

                               gates were never closed at all until

                               there was a mass of people in there.

                               Then they were closed and of course

                               eventually they were forced through.

                               Does that surprise you when I tell

                               you that?

          WWWJ                 Yes, yes it does sir.

          CC SHARP             Would you like to see the video?

          WWWJ                 No.

          CC SHARP             Do you take it that that is exactly

                               what happened? (buzzer)

          WWWJ                 Yes, yes I accept what you say sir.

43.45     CC SHARP             Well I think that that's the buzzer.

                               I think this is an ideal opportunity.

          P METCALF            I wonder if we shouldn't have a look

                               at that video however ...

          CC SHARP             Shall we do it the next, next tape?

          P METCALF            It's not my recollection of what I saw

                              after the, after the break.    I think

                              this is a good time for it to give you

                              a break.    We've been sitting here a

          P METCALF            Peter METCALF of Hairmond Studdards,

                               Mr JACKSON'S Solicitor.

00.41     CC SHARP             Thank you . This is a continuation of

                               the interview which was started

                               earlier today and I was just asking

                               some questions about the police

                               control outside the Leppings Lane

                               turnstile and I think what might be

                               opportune now is if I showed the

                               video which was taken from the fixed

                               closed-circuit television at

                               Hillsborough in 1988 (000088) and I

                               think I'd like to start showing you

                               the video at 2 o'clock (1400), 2 pm

                               (1400).    Now the perimeter gate that

                               I'm referring to and I'm pointing to

                               the television screen and I'm

                               pointing to the line where the iron

                               perimeter gates are at Hillsborough

                               outside Turnstiles A to G, and they

                               are closed.    The gate opposite the

                               turnstiles is open and the crowd is

                               actually caning through it into the

                               turnstiles and you can see on this

01.53                          picture a sterile area where there is

                               no crowd whatsoever.   Would you like

                               to ...    Before, before we go any

                               further can I just remind you, you are

                               still under caution and I, I forgot to




                                                                             1 221

                               say at the beginning of the tape.          So

                               anything you want to say please do

                               but ... the camera in 1988 (000088) is

                               now flitting around and it's stowing

                               scenes at various parts of the ground.

                               Back at Leppings Lane and again you

                               can see the gates were closed.        It is

                               that fleeting - if you want us to stop

                               it at any time please do.       Could you

                               mo... shall we move it on a bit

                               further?

          P METCALF            Yes.        I just, my point I mean, the

                               gate opposite that lane, yes I'd seen

                               that shut I ... the other gates appear

                               to be open. I, I'm not just it's, it's

                               •   •   •




          CC SHARP             These gates are shut.

          CC SHARP             and opposite the turnstiles well your

                               people have got to come in ...

          P METCALF            Yeh.

02.47     CC SHARP             I'm now pointing to the map on in the

                               interview room.       Here is the

                               turnstiles in question and here is the

                               gate which is open to let the people

                               come in to the turnstiles.       Those are

                               shut so that that is a ...

          P METCALF            We're in agreement that was I.... I

                               understood from the earlier comment

                               that it was being said that all those

                               gates were shut ...

          CC SHARP             No.

          P METCALF            whereas in... it's only those gates at

                               the end which give access to the

                               sterile area.

          CC SHARP             No.

          P METCALF            We're in absolute agree and I don't,

                               don't think we need to ...

          CC SHARP             don't need to bother with,

          P METCALF            see any more.

          CC SHARP             Thank you very much.       Thank you.

                               Now do you want to see the 1989

                               (000089) video which shows that those

                               gates are opened and the crowd build

                               up here is quite significant.

          P METCALF            Walter for myself I accept that the

                               gates were opened ...

          M J                  Yes    ... (overtalking)

          P METCALF            ... the gates were opened in '89

          CC SHARP             Can ... I think I'd like to frame the

                               question this way then.       If I had

                               told you that, the day before

                               Hillsborough last year, as ACC Ops




                                                                             1223

                              would you have been concerned about

                              that?

          WWWJ                Yes I, I mean o b . o b v i o u s l y I

                              would sir, yes.

          CC SHARP            Yes.    I take your point that as ACC

                              Ops you have to leave the control on

                              the ground ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            to the Ground Commanders on the day.

          WWWJ                That's right sir.

          CC SHARP            But I think that having shown you ...

                              (interruption)

          WWWJ                It was, it was an option that was

                              available for the, the officers to

                              use sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.    To be fair to that of course at

                              a much later stage those gates were

                              shut ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            and that there is also video evidence

                              to straw that that gate was forced and

                              that crowd came in after they had been

                              shut, the policeman couldn't hold that

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            but certainly there was no attempt to

                              shut them prior to the crowd getting

                              out of hand ...

          CC SHARP            when Gate C had been opened.

04.43     WWWJ                Certainly I've not had the opportunity

                              of asking the officers concerned ...

          CC SHARP            No I understand that.

          WWWJ                what their reason for that was sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes I understand.   So now can I just

                              repeat the question and say that do

                              you think it is feasible to whatever

                              the circumstances, to control the

                              crowd down the east pavement of

                              Leppings Lane, control the entrance

                              here as a filter by keeping gates

                              closed or opened and allowing only

                              limited numbers through, so that you

                              prevent congestion in the area out­

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            and therefore facilitate an even flow.

                              Do you think that's feasible?

          WWWJ                I would, I would accept that sir

                              providing you've got an orderly crowd

                              and not a crowd that's making a

                              determined effort to get in which

                              would make it a, a different situation.

          CC SHARP            Press you on it just a little, that if

                              the crowd find that those gates are

                              shut when they arrive and the filters

                              in operation when they arrive do you

                              not think it more likely that they'll

                              conply with that, then they would if

                              you don't have it?

05.53     WWWJ                Oh yes, a... absolutely right.     I was

                              just making the point that you made

                              earlier on sir that the gate was in

                              fact forced at one time when it was

                              closed.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                But yes I accept that.

          CC SHARP            Okay.     While we're on this point can

                              we just talk about the forcing of the

                              gates.     Your understanding of it was,

                              is what about the forcing of the

                              gates.    Which gate?   Could you point

                              to me on the map which gate do you

                              think you're talking about when you

                              said they forced the gates?

                              question.

          CC SHARP            Alright let me put it another way

                              then.     I'm not sure whether you said

                              it at the Public Inquiry but it was

06.48     CC SHARP              is because they forced them anyway.

                               Is that your view or was that your

          CC SHARP             Were you aware that those perimeter

                              evidence suggests that that gate was

                              forced at some stage.

                              forcing of those gates?

          WWWJ                Well yeh I m... I mean in speaking to

                              the officers, the circumstances as I

                              undertand it is there was a big crowd

                              build up there, they had seme mounted

                              officers there trying to stop them

                              forcing their way in and as a result

                              I understand they forced the gates.

                              Don't you see that the problem there

                              is with that.     It is feasible to

                              that those gates were forced anyway.

          WWWJ                Oh yeh.     I mean what I did say sir it

                              depends on the circumstances of the

                              crowd.     Now what sort of crowd you

                              have.     If you have an orderly crowd

                              coming down and I agree with you that

                              that if the gate is closed then people

                              naturally sort of stop don't they, but

                              if you've got a different type of

                              is that there were a lot of people who

                              intelligence that we, we in fact had,

                              we didn't expect a build up like that

                              in, in the last ten, fifteen minutes

                              to cause such a problem.

          CC SHARP            And yet I understand that in the

                              planning for the match, now I think it

                              would be in the 'D' Division Order,

                              there was considerable activity in

                              terms of going round licensees.    Now

                              I'm think, I, there was a policy

                              adopted in relation drink wasn't

                              there.

          WWWJ                That's right sir, and I think

                              basically that was a proactive policy




                                                                              1230

                              to try and deter people from having

                              too much to drink, so we were

                              practically involved.     Basically it's

                              it's good police practice to do that,

                              and that's, in fact that was one of

                              the other things that we did you've

                              just reminded me, we had this closed

                              door policy for licensees so that

                              they wouldn't, would let in their

                              ordinary customers but hopefully ...

10.53     CC SHARP            Why did you bring it in for '89

                              (000089) and not before?     Was it

                              because it was Liverpool or was ... ?

          WWWJ                No we, we just felt it was a good

                              practice to do that.

          CC SHARP            And you'd have done it whether it

                              was Charlton Athletic, Ipswich,

                              Oldham or ...

          WWWJ                Absolutely because you know drink is

                              always a factor in, in disorderly

                              behaviour, and it it, it was felt that

                              in general terms it was a good thing

                              to do.

          CC SHARP            But there was no specific intelligence

                              which caused you to do that?

          WWWJ                No, no sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.    Thank you.   So as far just to

                              finish off the iron perimeter gates

                              thing, has it been the practice in the

                              past, to your knowledge, to use those

                              iron perimeter gates in the way I've

                              described to act as a filter by having

                              them closed apart from one to allow

                              people in the controlled way.     Has

                              that been the usual practice?

          WWWJ                I couldn't tell you that sir for sure.

11.45     CC SHARP            Okay, okay.     Now for whatever reason

                              would you agree with me that at some

                              stage and for whatever reason, the

                              police lost control of the crowd

                              outside those turnstiles and I'm

                              pointing to the map in the area

                              outside Turnstiles A to G, between

                              Turnstiles A to G and the iron

          WWWJ                Yes sir.

          CC SHARP            Have you any views on how it happened



          WWWJ                Well we we ..

          CC SHARP            that we have lost control.

          WWWJ                All of us have gone over and over and

                              over those circumstances I think

                              basically the, the only reason we can

                              come up with is because of the flood

                              in the last ten, fifteen minutes, the

                              numbers of people that came there,

                              plus a lot of feedback frcm, frcm the

                              officers on the ground is there were




                                                                              1232

                              a large number who had been drinking,

                              Now that's not to say they were drunk

                              but what it does sometimes do is give

                               'em that extra anxiety to try and get

                              into the ground, ie it's ten minutes

                              to go we're going to get in, and I

                              think that's basically you know why

                              it, why it transpired.

12.59     CC SHARP            Okay.   Latecomers and drunk.    Did non­

                              ticket holders, do you think ...

                              (interruption)

          WWWJ                Yes as well.     There was also some

                              information fed back frcm some

                              officers to say there were non­

                              ticket holders there, people trying to

                              get into the turnstiles which I think

                              may have been an additional factor you

                              know later on towards the game starting

                              and because when I looked at your

                              programme on television there was a

                              kind of blip in the numbers coming in.

                              It it's sort of drops and then it

                              rises quite considerably and it would

                              appear to me I think it's the fact

                              that the turnstiles were getting stuck

                              at that time and conseqently there

                              weren't people getting in and it was

                              creating a further build up and

                              exacerbating the situation more sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.   Can we talk about the latecomers

                              then because I mean would you, it is

                              latecomers which cause the problem,

                              one of the, one of the causes of the

                              problem you see.      What is there in

                              your planning to deal with latecomers?

                              Do you think you've got adequate

                              planning in there in case what was it?

                              latecomers in, in the normal situation

                              there is adequate planning there.     I

                              mean there's, we've got a lot of

                              police officers to draw in, we've got

                              reserves, we've got sufficient police

                              officers outside to control them and

                              to consider any contingency plan that

                              might be necessary in normal

                              circumstances and based on the

                              information of course that we, we had.

          CC SHARP            Yes. Did you do anything in advance

                              Merseyside, giving the routes, the

                              early to get there.    We also went on

                              the importance of arriving late.      I

                              also wrote to the people who prepare

                              Liverpool and made them aware of the

                              need to get there in plenty of time to

                              avoid any, any congestion.

15.26     CC SHARP            Yes.    I think also there was an

                              arrangement made to have a gate open

                              early or seme gates open early to

          WWWJ                Yes.   We did that as well sir.

          CC SHARP            Did you know that the tickets

                              opening of those gates?

          WWWJ                What what.      Could you just refresh me

                              memory sir.

          CC SHARP            I think the ... a special arrangement

                              was made to have gates open frcm 11

                              ( 1100) . . .

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            whereas the tickets said the gates

                              would be open at 12 (1200).

          WWWJ                Twelve (1200, yes sir, yes.

          WWWJ                It's not.       I think what had happened

                              there they decided that they would

                              have 'em open an hour early to make it

                              even better ...

                              comers, any more of a problem than as

                              had been experienced in earlier years

                              do you think?

          WWWJ                I've never experienced anything like

                              what could you do about it in terms

                              just flooded in ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                in the last, last, particularly the

                              last ten fifteen minutes ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                and that makes it, policing, extremely

                              difficult.

          CC SHARP            Does it make it impossible?

          WWWJ                Virtually impossible.    I mean you,

                              you're talking about hundreds and

                              hundreds of police officers to try and

                              control the situation like that.       I

                              mean we are very much dependent on the

                              public to behave themselves to a a

                              certain extent but dealing with

                              football matches of course we, we're

                              alive to the need for certain

                              contingency plans, but then on that

                              particular day it made policing

                              virtually impossible sir.

17.34     CC SHARP            Okay.   Moving on just a little bit,

                              we're still with the Operational

                              Order - take that away now you don't

                              need that I think now.   And I think

                              we were talking about the roles of

                              the stewards and the policemen

                              earlier.   Did the Operation Order.        I

                              repeat the question if I'm ask... it

                              I put before I apologise, but I repeat

                              the question.    Did the Operation Order

                              ask or require any police officer to

                              monitor the crowd on the terraces with

                              a view to preventing overcrowding?

          WWWJ                Not specifically sir, but what it did

                              sir the order right at the, the

                              beginning ...

18.12     CC SHARP            We're looking at the 'D' Division

                              Operational Order Document 194.

          WWWJ                "With the intention of the police to

                              allow this match to take place to

                              public order and safety both inside

                              and outside the football ground to

                              segregate and control opposing fans

                              and prevent unnecessary obstruction

                              the order sir.

          CC SHARP            You pointed me to the word 'Safety'

18.50                         alright.   Did the Operation Order ask

                              or require any police officers to

                              monitor the numbers of fans going onto

          w m                 No it didn't sir.

          CC SHARP            Apart from the general statement there

                              about safety which you've just

                              referred me to you, do you know any­

                              thing in the Operation Order for 1988

                              (000088) or 1989 (000089) which deals

                              with the closing off of entry to any

                              of the pens when they're filled to

                              capacity?

          WWWJ                No I can't recollect it sir.     I can't

                              recollect at all sir.

          CC SHARP            Why, why doesn't the order cover those

                              eventualities?

19.33     WWWJ                Well one of the reasons is sir that

                              the semi-finals are treated

                              differently to an ordinary match.     If

                              I could perhaps just speak about an

                              ordinary match.   What happens there is

                              decisions made with be g... the

                              officer in charge and the club in

                              terms of how many pens are are

                              required, makes policing much easier.

                              That's dealt with by the information

                              that we actually receive from the

                              various clubs, so they decide that

                              they'll have two pens and that's

                              sufficient easier control.     In terms

                              of the semi-final, because the whole

                              lot is being used, it's dealt with




                                                                               1239
JACKSON              WALTER                                             112


                               similarly to the Kop at the other end

                               where Lord Just.. Justice TAYLOR made

                               those carrnents about the fans finding

                               their own level and that is basically

                              what it's all about in the, in the two

                              semi-finals ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                in the three semi-finals sir.

          CC SHARP            I think also you've said previously

                              that even though a, a policeman has

                              got a specific responsibility you

                              would expect him to take a wider brief

                              than that and because their officers

                              who regularly police Hillsborough they

                              do take a wider brief.

          WWWJ                They, they do indeed sir.

20.48     CC SHARP            So although there's nothing in the

                              order which specifically talks about

                              overcrowding and cutting off pens and

                              monitoring, what did you expect of

                              your police officers in respect of

                              overcrowding or whatever?

          WWWJ                Well certainly all of our police

                              officers are, are very well trained

                              and if they identified a particular

                              problem they would deal with it, they

                              would liaise with the stewards where

                              necessary, they would contact if it

                              was a PC or a Sergeant would contact




                                                                              1 240

                              his officer in charge of the serial

                              and say we've got a problem, we've got

                              to deal with it and they would deal

                              with it, so that they're well aware

                              that well you're used to policing

                              football matches and, and would deal

                              with anything as and when it occurs.

          CC SHARP            And would you expect them if they had

                              to deal with any aspect of overcrowd­

                              ing for example, that that would be

                              reported back through the system of

                              debriefs and whatever?

          WWWJ                Yes.

21.43     CC SHARP            You see in 1988 (000088) there is

                              evidence to show frcm police officers

                              that they specifically blocked off

                              the end of the tunnel into pens 3 and

                              4, so that the crowd could be diverted

                              other ways, but I understand that you

                              are unaware of that.

          WWWJ                I didn't know that sir.

          CC SHARP            And an' frcm what I've read in the

                              transcripts no other police officer

                              was ever aware of that.

          WWWJ                No I, I dealt with the, the debriefing

                              note the previous year from Chief

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 and certainly there was nothing in

                               there in the debriefing note about

                               closing the tunnel sir.

          CC SHARP             Yes okay.   But do you accept that it

                               it did happen?

          WWWJ                 I ... if you're telling me that then

                               yes.

          CC SHARP             Well there are policemen who said

                               they did it.

          WWWJ                 I accept it sir if ... yes, yes.

22.42     P METCALF            There is a possible reason for that in

                               in that there are seme Liverpool fans

                               who gave evidence who recollected that

                               it was stewards with policemen who ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          P METCALF            blocked the tunnel.   One in particular

                               who says it was more stewards than

                               policemen, so if it was an operation

                               by stewards with policemen helping

                               them then it wouldn't necessarily have

                               been reported ... (overtalking)

          CC SHARP             There's many permutations you can put

                               on it.   Yes I accept that.   The

                               policemen of course say they don't

                               know who told than to do it, someone




                                                                               1 242

                              told than to do it, they don't know

                              who told than to do it, so it could be

                              either way - you're quite right.        So

                              there is an expectation amongst our

                              that the, an order can't spell out

                              officers are aware of the need to deal

                              with situations as they arise and they

          CC SHARP            that seems to be your impression.       Do

                              you know anything of the system that

                              the club operates?    It's a sort of

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            Are you aware that that system will

                              not allow you, it doesn't provide

                              information sufficient to say there

                              are so many in that pen, so many in

                              that?

          WWWJ                That's right sir, it's it's just a

                              board.

          CC SHARP            Okay.     So either the club or the

                              police if they want to monitor pens

                              have got to put someone there.

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            Now on the day it seems as though no

                              one did.    Does that surprise you?

                              Does that alarm you?     Is there any­

                              thing in your system which you think

                              has fallen down, that that didn't

                              happen?

24.51     WWWJ                When you say there was no one there,

                              do you mean in Leppings Lane sir?

          CC SHARP            Well let's take two, let's take Pens

          CC SHARP            But, but certainly I'm right am I when

                              I say you're Standing Instructions and

                              the Green Guide put the responsibility

                              another thing in terms of putting

                              police officers in the pens.    It's not

                              good practice and we never have done

          CC SHARP            I understand that.     But you're

                              talking, you're pointing now to the

                              policemen on the perimeter track and

                              the policemen in the West Stand over­

          WWWJ                Right.

          CC SHARP            if we're looking at that particular

                              part of the ground as I'd like to,

                              okay.    So what we're really saying is

                              that although they've got specific

                              responsibilities and we could, we

                              could look at them if we wanted to,

                              and I think you've said there won't be

                              anything in there talking about over­

                              crowding, we would expect them to be

                              vigilant to all sorts of things, one

                              of which might be overcrowding what­

          CC SHARP            Now if he did spot that, what would

                              the policeman be expected to do?

          WWWJ                Well what, what he would do first of

                                would clearly speak to his supervisor

                                 and then with the appropriate

           CC SHARP             Yes.

27.06      WWWJ                 So I mean it depends where the over-

                                crowding was and what the options that

                                moving them wherever sir.

           CC SHARP             But the policemen haven't got radios,

                                only the supervisors have got radios.

                               they did.

                               pointed to that one place in the order

                               where you think overcrowding or could

                               be embraced which is safety and there

                               was seme debate about, there was a

                               fairly long debate ...

          WWWJ                 Yes, yes.

28.07     CC SHARP             about that at the Public Inquiry.     I

                               don't want to pursue that, but if that

                               is the only place in there where we

                               mention safety which embraces over­

                               crowding and if the role of the police

                               in terms of overcrowding is the great

                               unspoken which is the expectation of a

                               trained police officer.     I pick up the

                               suggestion which was made in the

                               Public Inquiry that the whole tenor of

                               the instruction to the serials was

                               really to emphasise the contingency

                               for disorder, perhaps a pitch invasion




                                                                                 1248

                              with very little if you like steering,

                              guidance as to their role in terras of

                              overcrowding and if I look at the

                              briefing notes which the various

                              people did in their briefings, there's

                              no mention there other than the

                              general word safety.   Now would you

                              agree with that proposition that there

                              is a danger that there is an over­

                              emphasis on the disorder side?

29.04     WWWJ                I think ACPO picked that up generally

                              across the Force nationally sir ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                but I think if you look at probably

                              there has been this kind of emphasis

                              more on the public order side.

                              Although we're aware of our respons­

                              ibilities for safety, there's been

                              more of a, an emphasis on public order

                              naturally because of what's happened

                              over the years, but it does go hand in

                              hand with safety, it's one of the

                              principles of, one of the principles

                              of policing and nevertheless ACPO have

                              identified that from the various bits

                              of information they send out, that

                              there is an over-emphasis on public

                              order and frcm now on there'll be




                                                                             1249

                              now going back to the expectation of

                              I talk perhaps now about the policeman

                              in the West Stand overlooking the

                              terraces, perhaps the policeman on the

                              track.   What has been suggested by

                              seme of the complainants is, well you

                              might expected that of them but they

                              certainly didn't do it because there

                              were 95 people killed in a crush.

                              So your expectations Chief Constable

                              are not being lived up to.     Now how

                              would, how would you answer that?

                              If we expect them to do it they didn't

                              seem to do it on the day.

30.30     WWWJ                Yeh.   I think there are one or two

                              things there.   I mean I think, I think

                              actually the barrier played a

                              significant effect in terms of it's,

                              in terms of it's collapsing.    It may

                              be that officers, the officers on the

                              day didn't have the perception of

                              being overcrowed.   In fact one of the

                              things that we've done and it's been




                                                                              1250

                              adopted nationally is we've made a

                              video of our overcrowding and crowd

                              safety to ensure that officers are

                              aware and will develop the perception

                              for overcrowding, and and it's obvious

                              on the day that they didn't perceive

                              or they didn't seem to perceive that

                              there was, there was overcrowding sir.

          CC SHARP            Have you any view on that as to why

                              that was?

31.23     mm                  I, I think all we've got to do and

                              I've looked at quite a number of

                              football matches on television since

                              particular aspects in relation to

                              Hillsborough, and if you look at the

                              crowds they're not much different to

                              those that were at Hillsborough having

                              looking at, looked at all the photo­

                              graphs, and it's difficult you say

                              well if you look at that it it, you

                              get the same perception looking at

                              that as you do looking at the photo­

                              graphs on Hillsborough and I think,

                              I think the main thing is there is

                              one, that that, that we need

                              nationally as I say which we are, we

                              are doing we picked it up, is to make

                              sure our officers are aware of

                              safety, aware of overcrowing and that




                                                                             1 25 3

                                their perception is right.   I think

                                the video that we've produced it's

                               been adopted nationally, cause

                               naturally we've taken the lead

                               because of Hillsborough in many areas

                               which will certainly help our police

                               officers in policing that situation.

32.23      CC SHARP            And it's a bit late this for seme

                               people that's what they would say.

           wmj                 I accept that sir, yes.

           CC SHARP            Can ... can we then look at specific-

                               all Serial number one.    This is the

                               perimeter track serial.    I think

                               there's the perimeter track serials.

                               I think that what you're saying to me

                               is that there's, there isn't a flavour

                               of safety which embraces overcrowding

                               in that, there was a flavour of safety

                               which included overcrowding in the

                               briefings, so and there was an

                               expectation of policemen being

                               trained, regular officers in the spots

                               to look out for overcrowding whatever,

                               so in terms of Serial one, what ...

                               apart from what is says there that

                               Serial one have got to do it and I'm

                               Operation Order.    I mean apart from

                               what it spells out there, what else

                               did you expect of them this expect­

                               ation?

33.28                          (Pause)

33.39     WWWJ                Well basically just as it spells out

                              there sir.     I, I mean they've got

                              responsibilities which are set out

                              there.     I mean they would also rtea]

                              as any police officer would any

                              situation that arose that required

                              their attention.     I'm, I'm not quite

                              sure what.

          CC SHARP            Alright well, put it another way

                              then.     In that Operation Order it

                              talks about, it directs that the

                              perimeter gates must remain bolted

                              at all times except when in use.

          WMJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP            No one is to be allowed access to the

                              track from the terrace without the

                              consent of a senior officer, except

                              to receive medical attention.     Now

                              that seems to be a pretty clear and

                              a pretty rigid policy, yet I do know

                              that even before the kick-off one of

                              those gates had been o... at least

                              one of those gates had been open and




                                                                              1 2t>3

                               people were being led along the

                               perimeter track and being rehoused.

                               Now can you talk me through that?

                               How does that equate and does that

                               surprise you, shock you or would you

                               say I'd expect that or whatever?

34.38      WWWJ                Well the m.... it, it doesn't

                               surprise me sir, because again in

                               relation to flexibility if there was a

                              problem or a perceived problem and I

                              wouldn't expect the police, police

                              officers to wait to ask a senior

                              officer to deal with it because I mean

                              my view and all the views of

                              Divisional Commanders here are despite

                              what's said there, the police officer

                              does something of necessity then he

                              gets one hundred per cent support, so

                              I'd expect him to deal with any

                              situation that arose that required

                              something like that being done.

                               happening when you saw that?

35.30     WWWJ                Well the, the first time I saw that I

                              was in the Directors' Box __

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                after the game started and I looked up

                              and saw people coining out and I wasn't

                              really sure what the problem was. It

                              could have been a number of problems

                              and I think I've said in me transcript

                              one was had there been a bit of bother,

                              two had we got fans in the wrong end,

                              you know that sometimes happens so we

                              move 'em to, to somewhere else, and

                              that's the sort of line I was going

                              down.

          CC SHARP            Yes okay.   So you saw that happening.

                              New does that equate with what you

                              were trying to explain to me, it's my

                              fault not yours, you were trying to

                              explain to me about this expectation

                              of this extra role and I think the

                              point I'm making is you've got that

                              expectation, there's a direct order

                              which tells them not to open the gate

                              and yet they were opening the gate ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            now does that support what you were

                              telling me or or, or is it a neutral,

                              neutral path.

36.31      WWWJ                No I think it supports sir, I would

                               expect a police officer to to, to

                               deal with a situation regardless of

                               what is said.   I mean that nay be a

                               bit rigid - it's actually designed to

                               ensure the police officer gets

                               appropriate assistance.   So what we

                               are saying to them unless you've got

                               a situation which is a, you know a

                              medical problem of where you need to

                              do something immediately, then you

                              should contact the senior officer so

                              he can get the appropriate support

                              cause it may be that, that the police

                              officer you know is ready and dives

                              in and exacerbates the situation ...

37.26      CC SHARP             I understand now. I understand what

                                you're saying.    Now then going back on

                                one other thing that we haven't really

                                talked about yet, did your role as ACC

                                Operations extend into rules or

                                guidance as to what criteria are to be

                                adopted for the delay of a kick-off

                                for example?

          WWWJ                  No sir, because I mean really that,

                                that's a matter for the Ground

                               Commander to decide on all of the

                               circumstances. I think it's very

                               difficult to ...

          CC SHARP             Were, were you ever consulted about

                               what rules they apply, Mr MOLE for

                               example ...

          WWWJ                 No sir.

          CC SHARP             they would.

          WWWJ                 In, if we go back to the 1987 (000087)

                               match, I went out to the perimeters

                               there on that particular match and I,

                               I saw that there was a big crowd build

                               up, you know a big traffic build up,

                               and I radioed on to the Ground

                               Commander ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 making a suggestion at that stage he

                               might look at the business of delaying

                               the match which he did for 15 minutes.

                                Well that was because I was there,

                                if there's any other police officers

                                they identified an issue that needed

                                addressing.

38.34      CC SHARP             Bold question - you were there on the

                                ground, you were watching the match,

                               you were in the ground before the

                               kick-off, do you think that the kick-

                               off should have been delayed on that

                               day as ACC Operations?     Was there

                               anything to suggest it should be?

          WWWJ                 Perhaps if I could give you two

                               situations sir and this is where it's

                               down to the Ground Commander ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 One is if he delays the match, there

                               is always a possibility of problems

                               inside, you know by the fans because

                               he has in fact delayed it, and

                               secondly the other one is you've got

                               a big crowd outside always with

                               problems, there is a possibility that

                               you, you should delay it.    Are you

                               asking me what I would have done in

                               the circumstances?

          CC SHARP             No, no, what you have done with the

                               benefit of hindsight ...

          WWWJ                 Yes, yes.

          WWWJ                 Yes.

           CC SHARP            Did you perceive anything which

                               occurred on that day which suggested

                               to you my god we ought to delay the

                               kick-off here.

39.32     WWWJ                 No, no sir, no.   Certainly frcm my

                               by that time there were a few places

                               left in the North Stand and certainly

                               when I glanced up the top end that

                               was filling quite nicely.   On, on

                               numerous occasions we get the

                               situation where we get 200 hundred

                               people coming in a bit late and that

                               wouldn't bother a football ground

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 a bit so I, I didn't see anything to

                               suggest that, that should happen sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.   Now we've gone a long way into

40.26     CC SHARP            Now at any stage before the match did

                              you discuss it with the Chief

                                 that we are still under, under caution



          WWWJ                  Right sir.

          CC SHARP              Mr JACKSON.

                                 (Pause)

          CC SHARP              I 've got the wrong time have I ...

                                The time then at the start of this

00.56                           tape is 12.43 (1243) and yes thank you.

                                Sorry about that.     We were just

                                talking about you approving the three

                                orders and you were giving me some

                                idea of what goes through your mind

                                when you approve them and you apply

                                the ACPO IIMAC principle to them and

                                you also said earlier I think that you

                                were satisfied these complied with

                                that.

          WWWJ                  Yes I was sir.

          CC SHARP              Thank you very much.     Now these three

                                orders clearly required a large amount

                                of manpower to be raised and you

                                briefly touched on it earlier.       How

                                was that amount of manpower raised?

          WWWJ                  Right.     How we raised manpower in

                                South Yorkshire sir, first of all we
JACKSON              WALTER


                               give the responsibility of the, the

                               planning to the Divisional Commander

                               where the Division is and his

                               responsibility also is to identify his

                              manpower needs.    Having identified his

                              manpower needs he will then see what

                              manpower can be raised on the Division

                               himself.   The additional manpower he

                              would come to the Operations

                              Department to raise that across the

                              Force, so we would then take manpower

                              from the various divisions to supple

                              ment his requirements.

02.18     CC SHARP            And I think you said earlier that you

                              had some involvement in the raising of

                              that manpower because they wanted

                              Mounted Branch and Dog Handlers.

          WWWJ                That's right, I mean if, if they,

                              it's a policy decision sir, if they

                              wanted additional mounted and dogs or

                              if they wanted to have men from

                              outside the Force, that's a policy

                              matter which can only be dealt with by

                              me, and Mr DUCKENFIELD requested

                              through the Chief Superintendent Ops

                              that he wanted more mounted, more

                              dogs.   Chief Superintendent Ops and I

                              had a discussion about that and I

                              approved that and made the necessary




                                                                         1265
JACKSON              WALTER                                             138


                               arrangements sir.

          CC SHARP             Yes.    Now that was Mr MOLE then

                               really started to get the manpower

                               together was it?

          WWWJ                 Yes it, it was, but I think as you

                               know, as they developed the order I

                              think the request came from when Mr

                              DUCKENFIELD was actually in, in sit.,

          CC SHARP            In situ.

          WWWJ                at the, at the end of that.     He felt



          CC SHARP            Okay.

          WWWJ                that he needed seme additional

                              resources.

03.18     CC SHARP            Right.    And I believe the total man-

                              available on the day was something

                              like 1,133.     Does that figure sound

                              that right to you?

          WWWJ                That's right sir, yes.

          CC SHARP            And I believe that was a, a 40

                              reduction, a reduction of 40 from the

                              previous year.

          WWWJ                Yes it was sir.

          CC SHARP            That's right.     And I think you've

                              explained earlier how you managed to

                              achieve that reduction.    Now that's a

                              lot of manpower and I believe it was

                              said that it represents about 38 per

                              cent of the South Yorkshire Police




                                                                              1266
JACKSON              WALTER                                             139


                               establishment.

          WWWJ                 Ye., that's yeh, about 38 per cent

                               sir, we're just under 3,000 so you're

                               ... it's about 38 per cent.

          CC SHARP            Now the question I ask from that is

                               in that case did you consider whether

                              or not it was an operation so large

                              that you ought to take personal

                              command of it?

          WWWJ                No I didn't.   We've, we've never done

                              it before sir and the, the other

                              operations were done in a similar sort

                              of way ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.

04.11     WWWJ                In fact I've got a feeling that the

                              Cup Final, I'm not sure of the

                              previous one, they may have up to now

                              was done by a Chief Superintendent.

                              Certainly the, the other semi-final

                              down at West Mids was done by a Chief

                              Superintendent as well, so it's, it is

                              general practice.   There was no reason

                              why I couldn't do it if I wanted to

                              but I didn't think it was necessary.

          CC SHARP            Well I mean could you give me an idea

                              of what guideline you would adopt,

                              what personal guideline, never mind

                              what the Chief says or the Deputy, but

                              what personal guideline would you




                                                                              1267

                               adopt then to say, this is one for me

                               I ought to really be ...

          WWWJ                Well if I could give an example, not

                               necessarily on...

          CC SHARP            No not necessarily.

          WWWJ                on football match sir.    We we, I dealt

                              with two armed seiges whilst I've been

                              with South Yorkshire, one lasted five

                              days the others two days, and I, I

                              took the view because it was firearms

                              I should take responsibility, so it

                              depends on if, depends on the circum­

                              stances.     Now if that match had shown

                              a turn of intelligence we we're likely

                              to have extreme serious disorder going

05.21                         wrong with it, then I think I would

                              have said to the Chief, I'm going to

                              take charge of this one because of the

                              circumstances. Another one that I also

                              took control of was the two, we had

                              two riots at Lindholme Prison in

                              Doncaster.    I turned out to that, went

                              to the Force Ops Room and took charge

                              of that and directing all the, the

                              resources with the Divisional Ccnmander

                              at Doncaster as a forward commander.

                              We dealt with both of those quite

                              successfully, and the reason for that

                              one is because of the disorder element




                                                                               ‘   1268

                               but how would those three Chief

                               Superintendents react to the ACC Ops,

                               I mean what matters do you think would

                              carte up to you for decision on the day

                              if it required it?

          WWWJ                 If if, if they felt there was a policy

                              matter then I was available you know

                              to deal with that, to deal with that

                              situation.

          CC SHARP            Yes.   And on the 15th of April 1989

                              (150489) were you on duty that day?

          WWWJ                Yes I was on weekend cover sir.

          CC SHARP            Yeh, now what does that mean?     I 've

                              seen it referred two ways, one was

                              Force call out and the other was

                              Force cover.   What, what does it mean?

07.24     WWWJ                Well what it means you're actually on

                              duty but you're available to deal with

                              any situation in the Force, so in fact

                              if there was a serious incident or an

                              armed incident or what have you, then

                              I could be contacted.   It didn't mean

                              on a Sunday for example you necessarily

                              had to go in to Police Headquarters

                              and be available from there.    You

                              could in fact be available at heme.

                              We've, we've got a 'Vidophone' at hone,

                              we've got a bleep system ...

          CC SHARP            Yes.




                                                                              1270

           WWWJ                 et cetera, as long as that you're

                                available within the Force area to

                                attend any situation.

           CC SHARP             I understand that.    And were you on

                                in uniform on the day?

          WWWJ                 No I was on, in civies.

           CC SHARP             In civies.    And is that normal

                               practice?

          WWWJ                 Well yeh, in fact the previous year

                               w h e n i wasn't on duty the ACC didn't

                               go there.     Normal practice is as much

                               as if, if I'd gone in uniform there I

                               think the, it tends to ...

          CC SHARP             I mean in general terms when you're on

                               Force call out I mean.

          WWWJ                 Oh yes, yes sir.    Normal practice.

          CC SHARP             Okay.

          WWWJ                 Yes.

08.23     CC SHARP             Now how did you start your duties on,

                               on that day, on the 15th? (150489)

                               Can you talk me through that?

          WWWJ                 Yes I can sir.    What I did I turned

                               out to Police Headquarters. I think

                               it was about roughly quarter to nine

                               (0845).   Did the general paperwork,

                               spoke to Chief Superintendent NESBIT,

                               the Ops, Ops and Traffic ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 at some time during, during the

                                 him about?

            WWWJ                 Well generally about the, the

                                 operation, ie was everything going

                                 alright, any problems et cetera, and

                                 he assured me it was.

            CC SHARP             It was going alright?

           WWWJ                  It was going alright.

           CC SHARP              Right.

           WWWJ                 Later on I went down to, I had

                                arranged particularly an extended

                                 Incident Room within the Force Control

                                Room ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 to deal exclusively with, with the

                                match, in other words the match

                                itself, it could listen in to 'D'

                                Division and the traffic ...

09.14      CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 et cetera.    And we had a Chief

                                Inspector overseeing that.    I mean

                                the rationale behind that was that if

                                we had any particular problem you know

                                they could pick it up ...

           WWWJ                 they could contact me or whoever.      I

                                went down there, I forgotten the time

                                now, spoke to the Chief inspector and
 JACKSON               WALTER


                                 also at that time Superintendent

                                 I spoke to them all generally about

                                 the, about the operation which was

                                 going alright.     They were were busy at

                                 that particular time, you know the

                                 traffic in ...

            CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                  to the ground but nothing that was

                                causing us any real problems, being

                                managed alright by the Traffic Depart­

                                ment.   After that ...

                                through it a bit then cause I think

                                this is just logistics now.     I think

                                you left Headquarters about 1.30 pro

                                (1330) ...

10.09      CC SHARP             and I think you were with Chief

                                end of the ground ...

            CC SHARP             Yes.   And when you arrived at

                                 Hillsborough where did you go first?

            WWWJ                 I went to the Control Room sir, walked

                                 through the Directors' car park and

                                went to the Control Room.

            CC SHARP            That's the Control Box?

           WWWJ                  It's the Police Control Box.

                                roughly what time that was?

           WWWJ                 I think it was roughly about five

                                past two (1405), just after two

                                o'clock (1400).

10.54      CC SHARP             Could it have been just before two

                                (1400) or ...

           WWWJ                 I thought it was just after two (1400)

                                I don't know.

           CC SHARP             Round about two o'clock (1400)?

            WWWJ                 Yes.

            CC SHARP             Now can you recall who was in the

                                 Control Box when you got there?

           WWWJ                  Yeh.   There was the video operator,

                                 I've forgotten his name now.

           CC SHARP              BICHARD?

           WWWJ                  BICHARD.

           WWWJ                 Yes PC BICHARD.     RYAN and Chief

                                 Inspector McROBBIE.    I think that was

                                it sir.

           CC SHARP             Okay.     Did you say anything to them?

           WWWJ                 Just a general chat and I hadn't had

                                really time to talk much to them when

                                I saw Superintendent MURRAY and Chief

                                Superintendent DUCKENFIELD coning up

                                the, the terrace to the Control Room.

           CC SHARP             Okay.   And that would been again

                                shortly after two o'clock (1400)?

           WWWJ                 Yes sir.

           CC SHARP             Interested in Mr McROBBIE because he

                                doesn't appear on the Operation Order.
11.44      WWWJ                 Right yeh.    Now I, I spoke to David

                                DUCKENFIELD about that and what, what

                                happened there and in fact was quite

                                well done perhaps in, in relation to

                                the lad himself, he was a new Chief

                                Inspector there and he'd asked Mr

                                DUCKENFIELD although he wasn't on the




                                                                           1 275

                                 order, could he come along and just

                                 have a look cause obviously he was

                                 going to deal with football matches

                                                 . -      1

                                 sir.                     J

           CC SHARP             Okay. And he was in plain clothes then

                                presumably?

           WWWJ                 He was in plain clothes yes.

           CC SHARP             Okay.       Now you say Mr MURRAY was with

                                Mr DUCKEN....          Do you know where

                                they'd been?

           WWWJ                 Yeh, they'd been to see the referee.

                                When they came off they said to me,

                                they'd been to see the referee to talk

                                about the, you know the arrangements

                                for the match.

           CC SHARP             Yes.       So by about five past two (1405)

                                the full complement of the Police

                              was Leppings Lane.     There were a lot

                              you've noted the ground is filling

                               to the atmosphere, just generally

                               looking around as the ground filled up.

18.51      WWWJ                  No, I, I suppose really because I was

                                 That's the only reason.

19.52      WWWJ                Well I was watching the sort of flow

                               and I saw the ball moved up to the

                               out behind the goals and then a number

                               realised that that there was seine sort

                                what was happening on the ground sir

           CC SHARP             Alright.

23.57      WWWJ                 cause it was an unusual thing you know

                                footballs hundreds of people to be

                                there.

          CC SHARP              Well then what was the impression you

                                got?       Was it, can I, I mean the words

                                I would put to you were was there any

                                air of puzzlement, pause or was there

                                hectic activity or was there panic or

                               what ... (overtalking)
          WWWJ                 Oh yes, well I no I think there was a

                               bit of both.       I think there was

                               concern and puzzlement as to what,

                               what was going on and what what, what

                               was happening.

          CC SHARP             Okay.       Now did you ask Mr DUCKENFIELD

                               what had gone on?

          WWWJ                 Yeh ... I said words to the effect

                               what's the problem David and he said

                               well I'm not sure yet.       I've forgotten

                               the ... his exact words but he, he

                               wasn't quite sure what, what had

                               caused the people to be out on the,
JACKSON              WALTER


                              on the perimeter sir.

          CC SHARP            Did he say anything at that stage

                              about a pitch invasion?     What would,

                              what you, looking for your statement?

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            There's your statment.

          WWWJ                I think he might, I think he might

                              have said something about it looks

                              like a pitch invasion or a possible

                              pitch invasion.

25.10     CC SHARP            Take your time.

25.24                         (Pause)

          WWWJ                I don't actually say, say there, but

                              I think there was a short conversation

                              about the possibility of a pitch

                              invasion sir.     I think that may have

                              been said.

          CC SHARP            Okay.   Perhaps in another way then

                              the question was anything said to you

                              on that occasion when you were in the

                              Police Box about the opening of Gate

                              C or about any gate being forced open

                              by hands?

          WWWJ                I don't recollect anything being said

                              at that particular time sir.

          CC SHARP            Okay.   Do you rec... recollect that

                              being said at some time but it might

                              have been there it might have been

                              another time?
JACKSON               WALTER


           WWWJ                  Right.    I, you mean I said in my

                                transcript and I remember this partic­

                                ularly saying in the melee something

                                might have been said about the gates

                                being stormed, but the first I

                                recollect about the gates being opened

                                was basically when we got virtually

                                everything wrapped up and I've asked

                                for Superintendent MARSHALL to come in

                                because I wanted the full circum­

                                stances.

26.24      CC SHARP             Okay we'll come back to that then.

                                But at the moment the answer to the

                                question was, was anything said about

                                the opening of Gate C or the forcing

                               of a gate, you don't recollect any­

                               thing being said at that time?
          WWWJ                 I don't sir ... sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.   Now while you were in the

                               Police, well first of all what did you

                               decide to do - anything at that time?
          WWWJ                 Yeh well I'm, I looked at the

                               situation and, and Mr MURRAY was sent

                               down by Mr DUCKENFIELD who quickly

                               said go down and see if you can get

                               the people cleared from the pitch.
          CC SHARP             Now you didn't know that though, he

                               wasn't there when you got there

                               presumably.
JACKSON               WALTER


           WWWJ                 Yeh.   I think what, what happened is

                                that if I recollect it right, he had

                                gone down, I arrived, he'd gone down

                                and I think he'd ccme back and then

                                I'd arrived.    I, I feel that I arrived

                                slightly behind him ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 so I feel that, I think Bernard MURRAY

                                was there ...

27.24      CC SHARP

           WWWJ                 and that Mr DUCKENFIELD had said, go

                                down and see what the problem is and

                                see if you can get the people off the

                               pitch, so he had gone then.    Now I'd

                               looked at the situation which was

                               looking down on the pitch which was,

                               was developing into a situation that I

                               didn't like and so I decided to go

                               down to the ground where I saw Roger

                               GREEN... Superintendent GREENWOOD and

                               I spoke to him very briefly because by

                               that, by that time they were, there

                               was a lot of people.   The match had

                               been stopped, a lot of people on the

                               ground, people lying on the pitch ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 quite clearly injured ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 and so I spoke to Bernard MURRAY,
 JACKSON               WALTER


                                  assessed the situation, sorry spoke

                                  to Superintendent GREENWOOD ...
            CC SHARP             GREENWOOD.
            WWWJ                 assessed the situation and he then

                                 went to deal with ...
            CC SHARP             Yes.
            WWWJ                 the rescue attempts sir.
            CC SHARP             Alright.    Then having s... well

                                 perhaps while you're talking to Mr

                                 GREENWOOD, what was your impression

                                 then of the police activity around at

                                 the time?    Did you get a feeling of

                                 satisfaction that everything was being

                                 done that could be done ...
28.31      WWWJ                 Oh yeh, I mean I ...

           CC SHARP             or were you much more preoccupied than

                                that?
           WWWJ                 Well no, I c... I could see quite

                                clearly that the gates were open sir.

                                There were policemen round the gates,

                                there were policemen up on the fence.

                                I had a recollection at that stage and

                                and it's only a recollection, you know

                                whether it was there or in the Control

                                Box of policemen coming down the back

                                from the terraces ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 so I mean my, my conclusion in

                                relation to all of that is that our
JACKSON              WALTER                                            167


                              police officers were busy engaged in a

                              rescue attempt in relation to the

                              people who, who went down.

          CC SHARP            Did you actually go up to Pens 3 and 4

                              at that time?

          WWWJ                No I didn't sir.

          CC SHARP            Where were you talking to Mr MURRAY at

                              the time?

          WWWJ                I was talking to Superintendent

                              GREENWOOD.

          CC SHARP            GREENWOOD sorry.

29.14     WWWJ                I think near the, the south side.

          CC SHARP            Can you point to it on the map if you



          WWWJ                So it would be round about here.

          CC SHARP            We're pointing to the map in the

                              south west comer of the playing area

                              roughly isn't it.

          WWWJ                Sir I think, I think ...

          CC SHARP            By Gates 1 and 2, somewhere near gates

                              1, and perimeter gates 1 and 2.

          WWWJ                Yes I think it was there that it was

                              ... (overspeech).

          CC SHARP            Now did, did, what inpress ion did you

                              get from Mr MURRAY at that time as to

                              what had happened?

          WWWJ                Superintendent GREENWOOD.

          CC SHARP            Sorry I ... yes Mr GREENWOOD.

          WWWJ                Superintendent GREENWOOD said that




                                                                             1295
JACKSON              WALTER


                               we'd obviously got a number of people

                               that injured and we had a crush

                               situation, so I mean when you, when

                               you looked at the situation it was

                               obv... obviously serious.   My, me

                               first thoughts then were the fact that

                               Superintendent GREENWOOD was going to

                               going to deal with the rescue, we'd

                               loads of police officers there and I

                               thought the best place for me as a

                               senior officer would be to go back to

                               the Control Room where we'd got our

                              conmunications to, to assess the

                              developing situation and be prepared

                              to take any action that was necessary.
30.24     CC SHARP            Right.    So you went back to the

                              Control Room?

          WWWJ                I went back to the Control Rocm sir.
          CC SHARP            Now up to the sta.. up to that s ...

                              up to that stage when you spoke to Mr

                              GREENWOOD, had you yet seen Mr KELLY

                              of the FA, Mr KIRTON of the FA or Mr

                                situation, there was a call from the

                                Force Operations Room asking if the

                                ACC Ops would confirm Operation

          WWWJ                 Right.

          CC SHARP             slowly if I can.    At that stage did

                               you give any orders or did you

                               consider yourself to be in command of

                                exactly whether I'd looked at the

           CC SHARP             Okay. Well let me, but someone did

                                and you authorised it.
           WWWJ                 I authorised it three, three tiroes

            CC SHARP              Okay.   Now if I can show you this,

                                  this is DPP Document 205 which is the

                                  South Yorkshire Operation Support and

                                 operation main contingency plans and

                                 do you recognise it?

           WWWJ                  Yes sir.

           CC SHARP              Now it seems to me that Operation

                                 Support is designed to deal with

                                 outbreaks of spontaneous disorder, in

                                 fact it says that on the front.     So

                                 are we saying then at the time that

                                 Operation Support was approved by

                                 yourself, the senior police involved,

                                 not necessarily you, but senior

                                policemen involved, thought they were

                                 still dealing with a disorder

                                situation?
33.06      WWWJ                 No not necessarily sir.   I mean I

                                think there were two aspects to it,

                                one is the possibility of you know an

                                outbreak of disorder because there was

                                somehow a lot of shouting and fran the

                                lappings Lane end, you know eminate

                                from there and the other thing is that

                                you know looking and looking down at

                                the ground When they came through and

                                said would ACC Ops confirm Operation

                                Support, I looked out of the window

                                and there was a, a lot of people by




                                                                                1299

                                  that time on on the pitch going well

                                  beyond the goals, a number of people

                                  lying down and it was quite clear that

                                  there was a possibility that we may

                                  need additional officers, whether it

                                  be for a disorder situation that might

                                  develop or that would be the, the

                                 problem that there was a lot a people

                                 who were obviously injured so I took

                                 the bull by the horns and asked for

                                 Operation Support because I could

                                 clearly see that we'd got a developing

                                 situation that might need additional

                                 officers for what, whatever purpose

                                 whether it be disorder or you know the

                                 people Who were injured.
            CC SHARP            And that was, that was on the first

                                occasion you went to the box, that was

                                before you went down to speak to ...
34.23       WWftJ               No I'm talking about the second

                                occasion sir when they came through to

                                confirm it.
            CC SHARP            I know but you asked, it was asked for

                                and you approved ...

            CC SHARP                    you were asked to approve it

                                 certainly.

            WWWJ                 At 3.10 (1510) yes.

            CC SHARP             Yes.

            WWWJ                 But I'd gone down, spoke, spoken to

                                 Roger GREENWOOD ...

            CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 come back up and if we just sort of

                                step back a bit I, I then got the

                                 information that we'd, we'd sent for,

                                for a Whole fleet of ambulances ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and that we then got a call for Force

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 saying, 'Will ACC Ops confirm ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

35.06      WWWJ                 Operation Support,' and so I looked at

                                the situation down there and it was

                                quite clear to me I thought I'm going

                                to grasp the bull by the horns ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and said, "Yes send us the extra

                                resources," because I felt that we, we

                                obviously ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 might need than, whether it be for a

                                disorder situation or the developing




                                                                         1301

                                 situation which I could see quite

                                 clearly was happening on the ground.
            CC SHARP             Alright.   So at the time that

                                 Operation Support was asked for,

                                 whether it was you or Mr DUCKENFIELD

                                 doesn't matter, it was about 1307 and

                                 that's in the incident log.
           WWWJ                  Yes, yes, yeh.

           CC SHARP              That was at the time when there was

                                 confusion and no one really knew in

                                 that Control Box what had happened.
           WWWJ                  That's right (overtalking).    I think

                                 there was seme confusion there and I

                                would say that at that stage probably

                                there was an element that there might

                                be a public order situation ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 as opposed to the ...

           CC SHARP             I mean do...    If I show you the
36.03                           incident log.     I'm now looking at DPP

                                Document 220A, it's the Extended

                                Incident log.     There is the actual log

                                which talks about it.    You can see it

                                it's at 1507 from Ground Control,

                                Operation Support to Hillsborough

                                please - repeat Operation Support.

                                Now to be fair from that it's

                                iirmediately followed is it not by

                                something about an ambulance is it?

                                 you're saying there is the element of

            CC SHARP             disorder and there is the element of

                                 injury ...

            WWWJ                 Yeh.

            CC SHARP             concerned, alright.

           CC SHARP             And at that stage when you came back

                                and you agreed that Operational

                                Support, to authorise Operation

37.04      WWWJ                 Well I thought there'd obviously been

                                a problem in the terraces Where some­

                                thing had gone wrong and running

                                through my mind was that the, there

                                had been been over... overcrowded,

                                 overcrowding.     I didn't know about the

                                 barrier having sir, giving way at that

                                 time but as a result of what Mr

                                 GREENWOOD told me I was quite, it was

                                quite clear in my mind we had a

                                crushing incident.
           CC SHARP             What was it he told that made you

                                think that?
           WWWJ                 Well he said that we've had a crushing

                                incident and a number of people have

                                been injured ...

                               you like.    Nowhere on this Extended

                               someone saying, 'Implement the Major

                                  were required, they would immediately

                                  implement the Major Incident Plan sir.
            CC SHARP             So and they're doing that by listening

                                 through on talk-through.
            WWWJ                 Right, yeh.

           CC SHARP             So now we've gone down onto the pitch

                                spoken to Mr GREENWDOD, you've gone

                                back up into the Police Control Box.

                                I would, I presume that during the

                                a lot of people came in and out ...

            CC SHARP              I understand that ...
            WWWJ                  Yes.

            CC SHARP              but can you specifically remember Mr

            WWWJ                  I, I, well I remember Mr MACKRELL

                                 because he, he was at the front of

                                 the Control Box and he spoke briefly

                                 to me and I didn't, I didn't intend

                                 to be vague about this you know ...
           CC SHARP              Yes.

           WWWJ                  because I wanted to say exactly what

                                 had happened ...

           CC SHARP              Yes.

           WWWJ                  and I was a bit concerned certainly on

                                 where it said there was certain

                                could just explain sir at that time

                                we, we were extremely busy ...

                                  it.

            WWWJ                 Yeh, well I mean it was hyped up quite

                                 considerably and lots of things were

                                 happening.   I mean it's all under

                                 Command and Control ...
            CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                  there for example, and David

                                 DUCKENFIELD was performing his, his

                                 ground, his incident command job in

                                 terms of directing certain things.

                                 that I should be dealing with then I

                                 was considering those, you know for

                                 example I was shouting to our

                                Controller, "I want the Casualty

                                there was lots of other things going

40.49      CC SHARP             Can I just ... now that just causes a

                                question, if you set up the Extended

                                Headquarters and if they're monitor­

                                Incident Plan, why do you need to make

                                all these arrangements about Casualty

                                Bureau and anything?
JACKSON              WALTER


            WWWJ                Well yes, yes, I think it's just the

                                fact that you know the incidents

                               happening there, the adrenalin is

                               going and you want to make sure that

                               everythings being done that should be

                               done.   I think one of the things that

                               we sometimes do in the service is we

                               we we, we duplicate, we tend to say is

                               it being done and I think the incident

                               was, the incident was so so traumatic

                               and stressful and so important in

                               terms of how we did things and did it

                               quickly, that despite the fact that

                               Chief Inspector EDMONDSON had set the

                               system going in terms of a Major

                               Incident Room at the Force Control

                              Room by sending the ambulance and

                              making sure the Major Incident Plan

                              was working, there were certain things

                              that vrere flashing through my mind

                              that I wanted to make sure ...
          CC SHARP            Okay.

          WWWJ                were, were being done sir.

                              that well Mr KELLY probably was there

                              and Mr KIRTON prob... probably was
JACKSON               WALTER


                                 there.

           WWWJ                 Yeh, yeh I did sir.
           CC SHARP             And it was Mr MACKRELL who spoke to

           WWWJ                 Yes he did.

                                and I, I didn't say much bee... at

                                that time because basically I was, I

                                was concerned with what was happening

                                down there, ie you know where the

                                injured people were being taken away,

                                did we have a sterile area - you'll

                                see in the Corttnand and Control for

                               example I think it was about 3.12 pn

                                (1512) we were asking for as... a

                               sterile area to make sure that the

                               ambulance came in et cetera ...
          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 and I merely said briefly to him, we

                               we're trying to get the people out

                               and away as quickly as possible and

                               everything, I didn't ...
          CC SHARP             Now, although you were in a very

                               Control Box, I think on a previous

                               occasion you did say that you heard

                               someone mention something about

                                think in terms of sort of do this, do

                                that, they, what's happened somebody,

                                I think somebody said something about

                                the gates being stormed sir ...
          CC SHARP              Okay and I think you actually said

                                that you thought it was Mr DUCKENFIELD.
          WWWJ                  I did yes. (buzzer)

          CC SHARP             Okay. Now can you, try to just pause

                               but I, can you try to remember what it

                               was that was actually said or shouted

                               or screamed or whatever it was ...
          WWWJ                 In ...

          CC SHARP             at that, in that sentence.   Was it the

                               Liverpool fans have stormed the gates

                               or was it someone has stormed the

                               gates or did it say the gates have

                               been broken down or the gates have

                               been stormed or what?

44.07      WWWJ                  1/ I think it was something to the

                                effect that the gates had been stormed

                                sir.

           CC SHARP             Okay.     What did you understand that to

                                mean?

           WWWJ                 That somebody had broken through the

                                gates, somebody had got, I didn't

                                really, I mean at that ... it seemed

                                unimportant at the time ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 in terms of what was, what was happen—

           CC SHARP             Okay.    So it couldn'd have been that

                                the storming of the gates was happen­

                                ing at the moment ...
          WWWJ                 Oh no.

          CC SHARP             it was talking about something which

                               had happened (overtalking) ...

          CC SHARP             So presumably it was in answer to or

                                just beginning to talk about when it

                               was the first time1you learned that

                               Mr DUCKENFIELD had authorised the

                               opening of the gates, particularly of

                               Gate C.   Can I ask you the question

                               again, when was the first time that
                                                 • ■ -j



                               you learned that Mr DUCKENFIELD had

                               authorised the opening of gates,

                               particularly of Gate C?
01.09      WWWJ                My, my first recollection of that was

                               when we had completed the, the rescue

                               and I asked Superintendent MARSHALL

                               to came in to discuss it and we, we

                              then had the first opportunity to

                              relax and if you can call it relaxing

                              and to discuss the situation and, and

                              that was my recollection of knowing

                              that the gates had been opened when

                              we discussed it together sir.
          CC SHARP            And that was in the Police Control

                              Box?
          WWWJ                That was in the Police Control Box,

                              yes.

          CC SHARP            And that would have been some time

                              after four o'clock (1600), after the

                              game had been abandoned?
          WWWJ                Yes it was sir.

          CC SHARP            So it would have been about 4.15

                              (1615) time?

                                   conversation with Mr MARSHALL.       Did

                                   you ask him what's happened or ...
           WWWJ                    Yes.

           CC SHARP                whatever?

           WWWJ                    Yeh.     I mean prior to that I think it

                                   was about 3.25'ish (1525) you'll find

                                   on the Command and Control.    I'd

                                   asked to speak to the Chief Constable

          CC SHARP              Yes.

          WWWJ                  cause quite clearly at that stage you

                                know the situation I wanted to brief

                               him and, and so to give him the best

                               brief possible I wanted Mr MARSHALL to

                               came in from outside and, and we we

                               talked about it there.        In other words

                               you know what, what's what's happened

                               •    •   •




          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 what was the situation and, and Roger

                               MARSHALL told me what had happened.
          CC SHARP             Well how did he say it?
          WWWJ                 I think ba... basically he said

                               because of the prevailing situation

                               outside, the number of people, the

                               pressure on the gates, we opened the

                               gates to ensure that the people out-
JACKSON               WALTER


                                 side weren't, didn't suffer.    I think

                                there was a great danger for the

                                people outside ...
03.04      CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and consequently he asked David

                                DUCKENFIELD to open the gates ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and then there was a sort of general

                                discussion about that.
           CC SHARP             Now did that come as a, a shock to

                                you at 4.15 (1615) when Roger

                                MARSHALL was telling you that?
          WWWJ                  Yeh I I, I was surprised at that

                               because I hadn't, I mean I'd got to

                               this perception in me, in me mind

                               that the gates had been stormed.
          CC SHARP             Yes okay.

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             Now I think it was about 3.30 pm

                               (1530) that you went to Sheffield

          WWWJ                 I did.

          CC SHARP             And can you describe for me who was

                               actually there in the boardroom?
          WWWJ                 I think in the, in the boardroom ware

                               the FA officials if I remember.     I'm

                               not sure whether the referee was there

           CC SHARP             And I think Mr MACKRELL was there.
03.59      WWWJ                 Yeh I think he was, yes.
           CC SHARP             Now first of all why did you go there?
           WWWJ                 They'd asked David DUCKENFIELD to go

                                there.     He'd got a message in the

                                came into the Control Box on the

                                earlier occasion?
           WWWJ                 No this was later on sir.
           CC SHARP             Yes but ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             could the appointment have been made

                               in the boardroom at the earlier

                               occasion?
          WWWJ                 Oh well it, sir I don't, I don't ...
          CC SHARP             Wall I think that the sit.... the

          WWWJ                 Right.

          CC SHARP             and that was when there was a lot of

           WWWJ                 Right.

           CC SHARP             Then at some time later you and Mr

04.43      WWWJ                 Right.

           CC SHARP             Now could it have been on Mr KELLY's

                                visit to the Control Box that he said

                                would you and Mr JACKSON ...

          WWWJ                 No I, I went with him because ...
          CC SHARP             Alright, okay.

          WWWJ                 I felt that I wanted to go and, and

                               one of the things that I was concerned

                               about at that stage sir is that we

                               hadn't announced the game was going to

                               be abandoned ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 although it was quite clear to me and

                               obvious to David DUCKENFIELD that the

                                 game was going to be abandoned ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 because of the circumstances. I

                                didn't want to make that announcement

                                      anybody else to make that announce­
05.36                           ment because I was concerned about

                                getting the injured out and I felt

                                quite strongly that if we made that

                                announcement and even if we'd have

                                said at that stage you know there's a

                                problem et cetera, we're going to

                                abandon the game, but please stand

                                still, I know how crowds operate who

                                would have drifted off and I'll give

                               you an example later on when we did

                               announce it, that actually happened.

                                I wanted to make sure that all the

                               injured got off to the various

                               hospitals ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 without any problems outside with

                               traffic and, and there was something

                               I think said about you know they want

                               to see Mr DUCKENFIELD        and

                               there was something sir suggested

                               about the abandon... abandonment of

                               the game and of course running through

                               ny mind is I'm not finished here yet.

                               I want to make sure whatever anybody




                                                                                  1318

                                 does, they don't make an announcement

                                 the game would be abandoned because

                                 that would have upset all of the plans

                                in terms of getting injured up to

                                hospital.

           CC SHARP             Now is that what happened in the

                                boardroom then there was, was there a

                                discussion about that?
06.40      WWWJ                 Yeh there was, there was basically

                                there was a discussion about, about

                                the game being abandonded, about the

                                injured people et cetera and David

                                DUCKENFIELD was explaining the

                                situation and I, I was anxious to get

                                back and I sort of after three or

                                four minutes interrupted at the end

                               and said the important thing at this

                               stage is to get off, make sure that

                               all the injured are off to hospital

                               and we won't be announcing, announcing

                               an abandon... abandonment of the game

                               at this stage, so it's basically that

                               type of conversation.
          CC SHARP             Where was Mr ... was Brian CLOUGH and

                               Kenny DALGLISH in the Directors'

                               time?

          WWWJ                 I don't think they were sir .

          CC SHARP             You don't.
JACKSON               WALTER


           WWWJ                 I don't think they were in there.
           CC SHARP             Okay.   Now you just said to me that

                                David DUCKENFIELD was telling than

                                what had happened.    When you went to

                                the boardroom what was your under­

                                standing of what had happened?
           WWWJ                 I took ... yeh, I think basically

                                running through my mind was still the

                                fact that the gates had been stormed.
07.42      CC SHARP             Stormed (overtalking).
           WWWJ                 Yeh.

           CC SHARP             Now when you came out of the boardroom

                               having completed that meeting to get

                               that, was your perception still the

                               same?

          WWWJ                 I think it was still the same sir,

                               yeh.

          CC SHARP             So no one had said anything in that

                               room which you heard anyway to change

                               that?

          WWWJ                 I, I don't recollect anything being

                               said in there sir.    My, my concent­

                               ration basically was in, in making

                               the point that we weren't, we weren't

                               going to make this announcement that

                               the game would be abandoned.   I mean

                               I think that was the important aspect.
          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 In terms of actually what happened it
JACKSON               WALTER


                                 ... as is usual with all operations

                                that could be picked up at the end ...
           CC SHARP             Yeh.

           WWWJ                 or put ...

           CC SHARP             That was your perception?
           WWWJ                 That was ray perception.   There were

                                still important operational matters to

                                to consider.    You know, ie is the

                                Casualty Bureau up running, function­

                                ing okay ...

08.31      CC SHARP             But the Club would be very interested



           WWWJ                 Yeh.

           CC SHARP            presumably.
          WWWJ                 and, and perhaps, perhaps I should

                               have spent or we should have spent a

                               bit more time in in, in that last bit.
          CC SHARP             No no, all I, I only raised that point

                               because it does indicate that the

                               clubs might be that anxious they, they

                               asked, 'What's happened, what has

                               happened?'    Now you're not sure that

                               that didn't happen in the boardroom -

                               causation wasn't talked about in the

                               boardroom as far as you know.
          WWWJ                 I I, I don't, I don't think so sir



          CC SHARP             Okay.

          WWWJ                 I think basically they they, they were
JACKSON               WALTER


                                talking about the number of people Who

                                were injured ...
           CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and, and the circumstance.       I don't

                                recollect anybody saying you know what

                                how did they get, how did this

                                happened ...

           CC SHARP             Right.

           WWWJ                 I don't recollect that sir.
09.13      CC SHARP             And, and you don't recollect anyone

                                saying the gates were forced in the

                                boardroom, and you don't recollect

                                anyone in the boardroom saying police

                                authorised the opening of Gate C?
          WWWJ                 No I don't sir.

          CC SHARP             Okay.

          WWWJ                 I just don't recollect that.
          CC SHARP             Okay.     Now you then went from the

                               boardroom back to the Control Box.
          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             Now my estimation would be about 3.35

                               (1535) something like that time.
          WWWJ                 Yes, yes.

          CC SHARP             Would you agree with that?

          WWWJ                 That's right sir.

          CC SHARP             Now can you describe for me again

                               what was happening in the Police Box

                               when       got   back.   What was the

                               atmosphere?
         WWWJ        Well prior to us leaving,

                     Superintendent MURRAY had arrived so

                     he was in control in, in the Control

                     •   •   •




        CC SHARP    While you were away?
        WWWJ        Whxle we were away.    Still very busy

                    and shortly after that, I think it was

                    shortly after that, and you can check

                    the tiroes, Kenny DALGLISH and Brian

                    CLOUGH arrived.
10.02   CC SHARP    Alright, yes.
        WWWJ        I think that was about ...
        CC SHARP    What did they want?
        WWWJ        About that time.
        CC SHARP   What did they want at that time?
        WWWJ       And basically I think they were

                    interest... oh basically they were

                   interested in the game being abandoned

                   and I spoke to CLOUGH in particular.

                   David was speaking to Kenny DALGLISH

                   and, and he said is there anything we,

                   I can do and so we said do, yes you

                   could make a, an announcement to give

                   him something to do.    You, you can

                   make an announcement to the Liverpool

                   fans, you know to keep calm, the

                   police have got it in control et

                   cetera and he went to make it a

                   Tannoy and I didn't realise this




                                                             1323
 JACKSON              WALTER


                                afterwards because we were so busy he

                                got went downstairs to the disc

                                jockey's Tannoy and did it from there.

                                Now I don't know whether there was

                                something wrong with our Tannoy at

                                that tune or he couldn't work it and,

                                and I was speaking to CLOUGH and

                                CLOUGH, "Oh we... we can't, the game

                                can't go on."   I said, "No it's not

                                going on but we're not making the

                                announcement because we've got a lot

                                of injured people to, to get away."

                                I was a bit concerned that he mi...

                               he might go and say well you know the

                               the, the game's being abandoned ...
11.13      CC SHARP            Yes.

           WWWJ                and I didn't want and I still didn't

                               want any announcement made at that

                               stage sir because I was still ...
           CC SHARP            So, so what announcement did Mr

                               DALGLISH actually make?

           WWWJ                Well ... DALGLISH did very well. He

                               spoke to the fans, telling than to

                               keep calm that the police were dealing

                               with the situation et cetera ...
           CC SHARP            Okay.

           WWWJ                and, and the fans did in fact cheer

                               that ...

                               at the other end - the Notts fans were

                               getting a bit excited and so because

          CC SHARP             Not as far as you know.       You didn't

                               ask him to go there?

            CC SHARP             Okay.   What were those things first?
            WWWJ                  I had in fact asked for the head of

                                took the call and told him to get down

                                to the ground as quickly as possible

                                and see me at the Control Box ...

                                chock-a-block with people in and out.

                                ffe couldn't keep track of it.    I mean

                                one of the things I, I mentioned at

                                 had a fireman stuck in the door and

                                 Mr ALOIS couldn't get in when he came

                                 up the stairs ...

            CC SHARP             Yes.
            WWWJ                 and I said see you down there so I

                                 walked down the stairs and, and

                                 briefly said that the temporary

                                 mortuary had been set up in the

                                 gymnasium.   I wanted him to take

                                 charge of that and also the inquiry

                                 into the events.    And the reason I

                                 lxnked both, we linked both, was

                                because quite clearly it, the

                                identification wasn't going to be

                                complicated or complex as it would

                                have been in a a, you know a rail

14.55      CC SHARP             Yes.

           WWWJ                 and I felt the two could go in tandem

                                and Mr ALOIS then went to set things

                                in motion to set up the HOLMES to

                                appoint an officer to that, to get

                                the Coroner down to tell him what we

                                were doing and what arrangements did

                                he think we should make et cetera.
           CC SHARP             Yes.

            CC SHARP             Yes.

            WWWJ                 and then it was after that, that I

                                 went onto the pitch again and spoke to

                                 John NESBIT, Chief Superintendent

                                 NESBIT sir.

            CC SHARP             Now when you got onto the pitch what

                                 was Mr NESBIT actually doing?
            WWWJ                 At that time I had to find him

                                 actually at that time because

                                 initially if you remember on the video

                                 he was directing the rescue and I, I

                                 eventually found him somewhere near

                                 the, somewhere round about I would

                                 think sir, round about here at that

                                time.

15.56      CC SHARP             Pointing to the plan, the western,

                                western end of the playing area out­

                                side the penalty area - it's only just

                                outside the penalty area.
           WWWJ                 Yes, it's somewhere about there sir,

                                I'm not exactly sure.

           CC SHARP             Somewhere just outside the Liverpool

                                penalty area.

           WWWJ                 And I think what Mr NESBIT had been

                                doing because we'd got off all the

                                people out at that stage and he'd

                                been generally doing a sort of morale

                                hundred per cent sure, but I think we

                                had only got about one injured person

                                left ...

           CC SHARP            Yes.

                               wrong then to have presumed that you

                               valued Mr NESBIT's advice more than

                               time see Mr DUCKENFIELD freeze and I

                               think by that we mean incapable of

                               absolutely amazed at that because I,

                               I thought he did a superb job did Mr

                               DUCKENFIELD there.   I thought he was

                               calm, cool, collected and he was good

                              with his staff, and we worked well

                              together in the box and I wasn't with

                              him in the, you know the ten minutes

                              sir as a professional police officer

                              in relation to that sir it's one of

                              the most difficult things that a

                              senior officer will ever face ...

                              through David DUCKENFIELD's mind, but

                              running through his mind may have

                              been that if there was another way of

                              doing it in opening the gates he

                              could actually see if he didn't

                              really want to open the gates, if




                                                                              133:2

                                there was another way and, and

                                consequently that, that in my view

                                would have been the reason.    He's a

                                think he would be running through al 1

                               what he was going to do there and I've

                                always found him that way in the five

                               years I've been in South Yorkshire.
           CC SHARP            Okay I understand that.   Thank you for

                               that.   Now until Mr NESBIT arrived on

                               your impression of the police rescue

           WWWJ                Well I, I know, I know that there has

                                in and do everything at the same time.

                                I can say that nevertheless whilst it

                                may have looked that way on the video

                                that all our officers and Roger

                                GREENWOOD were acting sensibly and

                                properly, and there's no doubt it gave

                                added strength on the arrival of Mr

                                NESBIT, but that was added strength

                               and it wasn't to say that the officers

                               who were there in the first place with

                               Roger GREENWOOD weren't doing a good

                               job.     They were doing a first class

                               job.

           CC SHARP            From the videos and the photographs

                               certainly there does seem to be a lot

                               of policemen with nothing to do ...
           WWWJ                Right,

           CC SHARP            as it were.

21.14      WWWJ                Yeh.     I mean I think I explained that

                               at the Judicial Inquiry, you know

                               having looked at at the videos.    Not

                               all of the policemen could get

                               involved in the situation.    You'd got

                               very narrow gates.    Now one might say

                               and one of sort of suggestion I think

                               was were made was whether an ambulance

                               you know placed for t h e       the area

                               so that people could deal with the

                               injured personnel.    What I would say




                                                                                1334

                                 is this my trip down in speaking to

                                 Roger GREENWOOD and the the, there

                                 appeared to me to be a lot of

                                 traumatised people and if you looked

                                at the situation from the Colntrol Box

                                there wasn't really any disorder

                                taking place and so the problem you're

                                then faced with, do you then at that

                                stage sweep 'em off and cause problems

                                and tie all your officers down, create

                                a problem or do you leave it.    So I

                                mean my view was that we, we should

                                leave the situation, we'd get people

                                involved is what I think we should do.

                                The supporters, a lot of the

                                supporters did a superb job and they

                                were getting involved in helping with

                                the rescue attempt so at the end of

                                the day my view was leave them where

                                they are, let them get involved, leave

                                those police officers where they are

                                because they can't, they couldn't get

                                into the gates, there was plenty of

                               police officers there ...

                               anything with them at that stage.

                                 think it's earlier rather than later.

           CC SHARP              No I think that's alright.    I'm not

                                 really making anything of the time

24.51      CC SHARP              Yes okay.   Now I know you've spoken

           WWWJ                 Yes.

           CC SHARP             because there's all sort of confusion

                                over what was and what was not done.

                                Did you personally make use or get

                                someone to use the Tannery on your

                               behalf?

          WWWJ                  It ... when, when I went in there and

                               we realised what the situation was,

                               David DUCKENFIELD was instructing I

                               think it's RYAN who was on the Tannoy,

                               to ask ask the, the fans to be calm

                               and clear the pitch.

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 I'm absolutely positive about that sir

                               and he did that and and, but the

                               feedback was I think that nobody has

                               heard that ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 that's the feedback.    I can't give you

                               an explanation for that at all, but I

                               know that Mr DUCKENFIELD was pushing

                               that heme.

          CC SHARP             Yes.    And then did you hear any other

26.00      WWWJ                 Yes, yeh yeh.

           CC SHARP             that's the abandonment of the game but

           WWWJ                 No I didn't hear any others sir.

           CC SHARP             Okay.    Did you, did anyone think of

                                using the Tannoy at whatever time but

                                it must have been used at an early

                                time to be of any effect?   Did anyone

                               think of using the Tannoy to get the

                               relieve the pressure in Pens 3 and 4,

                               perhaps even go back down the tunnel

                               into Pens 1 and 2, and 6 and 7 at seme

                               early stage?

          WWWJ                 I think, I mean Ro.. Roger GREENWOOD

                               was doing that frcm ground level.

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 He had a megaphone to actually, to

                               actually do that in in the early

                               stages.

          CC SHARP             You saw him doing that?

          WWWJ                 No I didn't see him doing it ...

          CC SHARP             You know he did it.

          WWWJ                 In fact I think ...

          CC SHARP             I wouldn't dispute it, I just wondered

                               if you'd actually seen him do it.

          WWWJ                 I think it's on the video sir.

 26.52      CC SHARP             Yes.

            WWWJ                 I, I didn't see him do it.     Apparently

                                 he was there with the video, with the

                                 the T... the Tannoy ...

            WWWJ                 asking them to move back.

            CC SHARP             Have you any personal knowledge of the

                                Tannoy actually being used at the

                                lappings Lane turnstile early on

                                before kick-off for exairple?

           WWWJ                 No but I understand it was used.

           CC SHARP             But you don't have any personal

                                knowledge of it.

           WWWJ                 No I don't know sir, but I understand

                                it was used there as well.

           CC SHARP             Okay, yes yes.     So you decided to make

                                the announcement that the match would

                                be abandoned and you ... I think you

                                said s... RYAN or MUR... Superintend­

                                ent MURRAY actually made the

                                announcement.

           WWWJ                 ... MURRAY actually announced it,

                                yes.

           CC SHARP             Now what was the effect on the crowd

                                when that announcement was made?

           WWWJ                 It was, it was good, but if you

                                remember I was going to say to you ...

           CC SHARP             That's right.

27.35      WWWJ                 earlier on that I would, I would tell
JACKSON              WALTER


                               you something and at that stage they
                                                 i
                               all ... what what i did I said

                               because I think there was one left to

                               go and I said will you make an

                               announcement that the game is going to

                               be abandoned, but we're still in the
                                              . ^
                               process of dealing with the injured,

                              would you all stand still, will you

                               all stay where you are for seme time.

                              Some did, a lot didn't.     They all

                              started drifting off.     And, and I mean

                              I think that basically is always the

                              way with crowds - you will get some

                              who'll say yeh right and others who,

                              you know the small ielement, won't, and

                              a lot of them started drifting off at

                              that time sir.

          CC SHARP            Yes.

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            But basically the effect of the

                              announcement was one of applause -

                              vrell received.

          WWWJ                Yes it was sir.

          CC SHARP            And I think Mr MURRAY asked them to

                              stay where they are ...

          WWWJ                Yes.

          CC SHARP            until things were done and they, they

                              accepted that really.

          WWWJ                Oh yes, yes.
JACKSON               WALTER


28.37      CC SHARP             Basically they did.

           WWWJ                 Yes.

           CC SHARP             Now the question of course is then

                                doesn't that indicate that perhaps an

                                earlier announcement could have had a

                                similar effect on ...

          WWWJ                  I think in, I think in hindsight and I

                               think it's important you know to say

                               that in hindsight that, that there is

                               every possibility that it may have had

                               a good effect sir, yes.

          CC SHARP             Okay.     So about 4.45'ish (1645) when

                               all the casualties had eventually been

                               cleared ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             was it?    And I think that's, it's

                               about that time the last casualty just

                               disappearing or perhaps has gone ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             that Mr MOLE came to see you ...

          WWWJ                 Yes.

          CC SHARP             Now why did Mr MDLE cane to see you?

          WWWJ                 Well we, what what we, what we did is

                               that we asked for Operation Support

                               and any other officer, otter officer

                               who might be available.

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 Brian MOLE was in his, was in his car

                               and he heard the, he heard that and as
JACKSON               WALTER


                                a result of that he attended.

29.33      CC SHARP             Yes.   And what sort of conversation

                                did you have with him?

           WWWJ                 Oh basically I explained briefly what

                                had happened ...

           CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                  What we'd done I said I, I'd got Mr

                               mortuary ...

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 and also the inquiry aspect, the

                               Coroner had been turned out in

                               relation to the identification

                               procedures that would take place.

                               I got Superintendent TORR who had

                               special responsibility with the

                               Casualty Bureau that was up and

                               running - all linked up.   I'd spoken

                               to the Chief.   I felt that there was

                               a, well not felt there was a need for

                               himself and Superintendent MURRAY who

                               was responsible outside, David

                               DUCKENFIELD to go, brief the Chief

                               and the Deputy because of the, the

                               press conference.

          CC SHARP             Yes.

          WWWJ                 So there was a need to get that

                               information there.   Everything was

                               done that could be done there.    Brian
JACKSON               WALTER


                                   MOLE was familiar with the ground

                                   obviously ...

           CC SHARP                Yes.

30.30      WWWJ                    and I was now make, appointing him

                                   as the Incident, Incident Commander.
           CC SHARP                So they were going to go away and

                                   brief the Chief.

                               Mr MOLE, by that time you were aware

                               of course that the gates had been

          CC SHARP             Okay.       Now and I think you told me

          CC SHARP            Do you find it incredible that he

                              didn't tell you or ...?

          WWWJ                Not really given the circumstances you

                              feel it was necessary to say anything

                              relaying the information at Roger as

                               specific questions I want to ask you.

                               Were you at any time deceitful to

                               anyone about the opening of Gate C or

                               any other gate?

          WWWJ                 I wasn't sir.

          CC SHARP             Did you at any time knowingly mislead

                               anyone about the opening of Gate C or

                               any other gate?

          WWWJ                 No sir and I would never do that.

                               That's why I told the, when I spoke

                               to the Chief Constable I made him

                               aware immediately with MARSHALL there

                               in the Control Box.   There is
JACKSON               WALTER


                                absolutely no way I would do that.

           CC SHARP             And did you at any time collude with

                                Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD or

                                anyone else intending to deceive or

                                mislead anyone about any opening of

                                any gate?

34.41     WWWJ                 Absolutely not sir.     I mean as an

                               day did you eventually get off duty?

                               is with the Director of Public

                               Prosecutions and a copy of this

                               will consider if the evidence

                               justifies any criminal proceedings

                               against you for the offences I

                               outlined at the start, that is to say

                               Manslaughter or for Culpable

                               Malfeasance which is just an old

                               offence for failing to do your duty.

                               Do you understand?

           WWWJ                I do sir.

          CC SHARP             Thank you.

01.01     CC SHARP             On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                               disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                               Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                               Following a Public Inquiry and report

                               the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                               Police consulted with the Director of
 JACKSON              WALTER                                              2


                                Public Prosecutions and as a result

                               West Midlands Police were requested to

                               do a criminal investigation.     This

                                investigation came at the same time

                               that certain members of the public

                               decided to make specific allegations

                               against named police officers.      You

                               are one of those police officers.

                               I now intend to deal with the

                               discipline aspects of this inquiry and

                               I note that your solicitor is present.

                               You will recall that you were served

                               with Regulation 6 Notices under the

                               Police Discipline Senior Officers

                               Regulations of 1985 (000085).      These

                               are the copies of those notices.     Do

                               you recognise them?

01.57      WWWJ                I do sir.

           CC SHARP            Would you just like to to, to study

                               them or I'll read them out loud if

                               you so wish?

           WWWJ                No I I've, I've read them and under­

                               stand them sir.

           CC SHARP            Thank you.   And may I draw your

02.10                          attention to the formal caution which

                               is printed on both of the forms.     Do

                               you fully understand the nature of

                               the form and its contents?

           WWWJ                I do sir.

            CC SHARP             Thank you.   Do you agree to use the
                                                     f

                                 questions and answers already given

                                 to me in the criminal interview for

                                 the discipline aspects?

            WWWJ                 I do sir.

            CC SHARP             Is there anything you would like to

                                add to those?
                                                     \

           WWWJ                 No only in, in relation to failing to

                                control the disaster.    I think what

                                I've said to you sir quite clearly

                                shows that I did my job one hundred

                                per cent and the only thing I would

                                say in relation to that is that

                                perhaps there is a misunderstanding

                                on Mr HICKS behalf who's made a

                                complaint in relation to what an

                                Assistant Chief Constable's role

                                really is, and I think I have outlined

                                that thoroughly to you and shown that

                                I, I did my job properly sir.

03.09      CC SHARP             Thank you.    In that case I've no

                                further questions to ask you.    The

                                facts will be reported to your Police

                                Authority, to determine if you should

                                face any discipline charges.    Do you

                                understand that?

           WWWJ                 I do sir.

           CC SHARP             I'm now switching off the recorder
