                            SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975




    The involvement of the Fire Service in the implementation of the Safety

    of Sports Ground Act, 1975



1   The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SSGA) was passed in 1975 following the

    publication        in    1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

    Sports Grounds which            was    prepared    by   Lord    Wheatley        following          the

    serious    accident        at    Ibrox    Park    Football     Ground     in        1971, when 66

    spectators were killed on a stairway.



    The Home Office issued Guidance to Local Authorities under cover of

    Home Officer Circular 150/1975.                                                                          Ex 1




2   The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                          State       power    to

    require     through       designation orders that safety certificates be issued

    to sports stadia with accommodation for more                   than      10,000        spectators.

    The     intention       was     for the Act to come into force gradually through a

    phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                               immediate

    financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.




3   The     first   order was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

    football clubs and             certain    international       grounds.        The     Home     Office

    issued     guidance       t:o    local    authorities       under     cover     of     Home Office .

    Circular 130/76. Sheffield Wednesday's ground was designated in                               August     Ex 2

    1978,     although       the club was not in the first division, because of itsi

    quasi international use.              Second     division     clubs    were         designated      in

    August     1979.        Third     and fourth division clubs and rugby league clubs

    were designated in August 1985, following the                       Bradford        City     Football

    Club fire.                 ,

1.4   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety at Sports Grounds                   (Football)”,       commonly        known          as     the    Green          Ex

      Guide.       This     gave      guidance        on     measures for improving the safety of

      spectators at sports grounds and extended the                           recommendations                   of   the

      Wheatley      Report.          The     County Council later contacted the Home Office

      regarding the application of the Green Guide and had been informed that

      basically       any     new     work       or construction had to be of a                         standard not

      lower than that set out in the Green Guide but that maximum flexibility

      had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.




1.5   The     former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

      delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                         Ground      Act

      to     the   Fire       Service        Committee.       On 8 th January, 1976, the Committee

      decided that          their      functions           should     be exercised             through          Officer

      Working      Parties       for       the      four   borough .council areas, consisting of

      representatives of the                 police,         the    Fire Service             and    the       building

      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by David Vaughan who was the responsible officer of the                                      Department         of

      Administration.            He     also        took the chair and produced the minutes for

      all working party meetings.




1.6   In ordar to avoid duplication and                      division        of    resources,             a     primary

      authority         was     chosen        for    the     carrying        out        of     inspections,          re-

      inspactionn, and           making          final       technical recommendations                    using      the

      headings        given     in     the       contents summary of the Green Guide with soma

      additions.        The pz'imary authority responsible was required                                  to     consult

      the     other authorities concerned before finalising any recommendations.

      It v?ill be seen from the schedule that the Fire Service were designated                                             Ex

      the     primary       authority         for     means of escape and fire precautions.                           By

      virtue of their general experience as a                         fire        and        emergency        service,

      they     were     able     to     give        advice    on this subject.                 However, the Fire

                                              - 2 -
      Service did not attend and have not                        attended       football          matches        as    a

      matter of course.



1.7   It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

      Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                                 the     Officer      Working

      Party    to    be         held    after       which      the    agreed      recommendations            of all

      disciplines were               amalgamated        into     a    report      by     the      Administration

      Department          and     sent to the club(s).               Copies of all correspondence and

      the minutes of meetings were sent to each member and                                   all    arrangements

      for meetings were made by the Administration Department.




1.8   It    was     the     practice for the Officer Working Parties to carry out                                     two

      inspections of the ground each year, commonly                             known        as    "summer"           and

      "winter"       inspections.              It was Fire Service practice to be represented

      by officers          from        both    Divisional         and    Headquarters             levels     at       all

      meetings       and        inspections          whenever         possible.        This enabled a common

      standard to be applied.




1.9   With the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council                                      on 1st April,

      1986 enforcement in South Yorkshire was to pass                              to the four

      Metropolitan          District            Councils,        Rotherham, Barnsley,              Doncaster          and

      Sheffield.          The Local Government Act, 1985 amended Section 3 (3) of the

      Safety      of Sports Ground Act so that in future in metropolitan counties

      the local authority,                in     this    case        Sheffield     Metropolitan             District

      Council       was     required           to   send a copy of any application for a safety

      certificate for a stadium to the chief officer of police and                                         the    fire

      authority       and        to     consult      them       about the terms and conditions to be

      included in the certificate.                      The Officer Working Party was replaced by

      the      Safety           of      Sports       Ground          Advisory      Group           comprising          of

      representatives from                police,        Fire     Service,       the     building          surveyors

                                               - 3 -
        division          and   the    Health   & Consumer Services Department of the local

        authority.          The Home Office issued guidance           on     the     new   arrangements

        under cover of Home Office Circular 7/1986.                                                           Ex 5




    1.10 On   18th        February,     1986, a memorandum from the Chief Fire Officer was                    Ex 6

         circulated to all five Fire Service                divisions      detailing       the    changes

         that were to take place under the Local Government Act 1985 and the way

         the administrative arrangements of the Safety                     of   Sports     Grounds     Act

         1975, would be affected.



         It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

I        between divisions and District Councils who would                      be    responsible      for

         administering the Act.



    1.11 A letter dated 24th February, 1986, was received from Sheffield City                                 Ex 7

         Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

         as the Licensing Authority under the                Safety     of      Sports     Grounds    Act,

         1975,       it    would      be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

         for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                             future

         arrangements for administering the Act.




    1.12 On the 5th March, 1986 Mr D Vaughan                arranged a joint meeting, for the

         2 4th   March,         1986 with the officers of the District Councils who would Ex 8

         be taking over responsibility for Safety of Sports Grounds Act                           matters

         which     was       attended by officers from the police and Fire Service.                     The

         purpose of the meeting was to hand over the County Council's files                             and

         have    a        general     discussion    on Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                The

         Fire Service said that they hoped the South                  Yorkshire          County   Council

         General          Safety    Certificate     would   be   adopted        by    all the districts

         because this would help             them    standardise      on     one     rather   than     four

         different sets of conditions.

                                             _ 4 _
1.13 In Sheffield the Administration and Legal Department became the

    responsible       department and Mr David Bownes was the responsible officer

    within the department.             In a letter dated 5th June, 1986, they attached                    Ex 9

     a   copy   of    a report which had been placed before the General Purposes

     panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a copy of the                     panel's     resolution

     in relation to that report.



     With   reference      to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

     that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

     and    Fire     Service     had indicated that they wished this to continue for

     reasons of administrative simplicity.                   It then went on     to    state    that

     the    conditions     gave        some   cause    for     concern as they appeared to be

     inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.




     It was proposed to re-draft the Certificate Conditions after which                           the

     Sheffield       Wednesday     certificate         would    be   replaced.        The Sheffield

     United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                           before

     the    start     of   the    1986/87        season. In the covering letter, Mr Bownes              Ex 9

     indicated that the re-drafting               of   the     certificate     conditions      would

     shortly be completed and the comments of the Fire Service would then be

     sought.



     The Panel was asked for authority for the present administrative system

     to be continued for the time being.




1.14 A meeting took place on 10th March, 1987 to deal with the future

     administration        of    the     Council's certification function.              The general     Ex 10

     feeling of the meeting was that the roles of                    each    authority     involved

     should be defined perhaps along the lines of the South Yorkshire County

     Council system.        This was described in a letter dated,                14th May, 1987,

                                         - 5 -
  from     Mr D Bownes, which enclosed a draft division of responsibilities.

  The letter asked for comments on the proposals                            that,    inter       alia    the   Ex 11

  following       should   be     Fire    Service responsibilities fire precautions,

   fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium capacity.                                    It

  was    also     proposed      there     should    in     future           be   only one inspection

  annually.




15 In a letter dated 7th July, 1987 the Fire Service                                                           Ex 12



   (a)     expressed the     view       that    division         of        responsibilities        between

           authorities       should      remain     along        the        lines    of    the    schedule
                                                                                                               Ex 4
           previously adopted and referred to in Para 1.6




   (b)     accepted the proposal of one inspection annually.




16 At a meeting of the Advisory Group on 16th July, 1987,                                 the    definition
                                                                                                               Ex 13
   of    roles     was   discussed.        DO     Grimshaw        said        that     when determining

   capacity figures each discipline would have                         to     put    forward      figures.

   Those     of   the    Fire    Service        would     only be based on means of escape.

   Following those remarks, it was agreed that:




   (1)     Roles should be broadly defined and responsibilities taken                               on    by

           the    appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police, Fire

           and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs;.




         All contact with the            grounds        should        be     through      the    licensing

           authority.




         Environmental Health would take a "general safety role" and not be

           a "lead" authority.
         (2)   The annual inspection was to be a                joint   full     inspection     to   be

               carried out near the end of each season.




               D.P.   ("during       performance”)        inspections      were       to be done on an

               individual basis.          Prior arrangements were to             be     made with    the

               Police,   but       not    the     Club.    The Licensing Authority were to be

               informed when an inspection had taken place.




         (3)   The meeting was informed that legally the group                    was    an    advisory

               authority.         Only the council would be the ultimate decision making

-■u: £         authority.




         (4) Individual authorities were to correspond with the sports                          grounds

               through      the     licensing authority who would subsequently circulate

               copies of all letters to each "lead" authority.




               Meetings of         the   group    would    be    held at       irregular      intervals

               depending      on need and would be called by any member of the group.

               Individual authorities            did not need to attendspecific meetings if

               they had no "interest".




               Agendas were to be issued prior to each meeting.




                                          - 7 -
1.17 On     3rd   August,      1987,   a     draft   report    which    had been prepared for

     submission to the general purposes panel of the City Council                      was      sent   Ex 14

     to     the     Fire   Service.        In   that report, under the heading of "future

     administration of council certification function', it                  was       recommended

     that     the     "Safety    of    Sports Grounds Advisory Group" would serve as a

     forum for discussion between officers               and    would    form   the     basis     of

     written        detailed    advice to the council.         It was also recommended that

     the roles of the various officers should be                 defined    along      the   lines

     discussed        at the meeting of the 16th July, 1987 and the point was made

     that there were extensive areas of potential overlap.

2.    History: 1978-1986

2.1   The South Yorkshire                   County        Council         received an         application        for     a

      General         Safety      Certificate              in    September,           1978.      The     club engaged

      Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                     consulting         engineers

      as their consultants.



2.2   In     November         1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

      prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                            Officer

      Working         Parties      was        submitted          to      the      Fire     Service       Committee for

      approval to be used throughout the county.




2.3   On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer sent a memorandum                                            to      the

      Chief         Executive          of    South        Yorkshire           County Council suggesting that                  Ex 15

      officers of            the working           party        undertake         a   comprehensive           survey     of

      Sheffield           Wednesday          Football           Club      in unison rather than separately.

      The Chief Fire Officer suggested that a copy                                    of   the    report        of     each

      department             be   provided           to     each       other department involved to enable

      problems to            be discussed so              that     an        acceptable       approach       might       be

      determined           and     consolidated              into        a    single report       which should be

      forwarded to the club.                      The memorandum made several other                      observations

      regarding the standards necessary.




2.4    (i)        Oa 17th January, 1979               the South Yorkshire County Council received
                                                                                                                              Ex. 16
                  a report prepared by Ea«twood and Partners on ground                                   capacity        of

                  Sheffield       Wednesday          Football            Club,    in connection          with        thnix;

                  application          for    a     General         Safety       Certificate.            Tlis        report
             'l



                  .indicated      that       the     Green       Guide         had been ussd as the basis for

                  their   calculations,              although            as    with    probably        all      existing

                  grounds,        it        would         not       be        possible     to    satisfy        all     the




                                                   - 9 -
    recommendations in the guide and reasonable                     compromise          would    be

    needed.



(ii) Paragraph (b) of the report dealt with the west terrace (including

    the lower level at the north west corner but excluding                          the       north

    west        corner     reinforced concrete terrace).            The report considered

    that despite the fact that the full area of the west terrace could

        accommodate about 8,000 spectators, due to the lack of gangways an

        allowance should be made for circulation space in order that                            good

        packing could be achieved.            It further suggested that an allowance

        of 10 % be made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity

        for the west terrace of 7,200.



        Crush     barriers were to be designed to match the capacity of 7,200

        spectators and additional barriers and                 appropriate        strengthening

        of existing barriers would be provided for where necessary.




        Reference     is     also     made    to   the    evacuation      time     for the west

        terrace, this being about six minutes based on the                       exits    already

        available     and     also to the fact that some spectators would be 25m

        from an exit although movement along the terrace would be easy and

        quick.      The     existing     exits     were   through       the tunnel and round

        either side of the west stand.




(iii)           A meeting of the Officer           Working     Party    was      held    on     12th
                                                                                                       Ex 17
                February,     1979,     the    purpose    of    which     was to discuss the

                report prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider                         the

                views which should be put to the club.




                                    - 10 -
         With     regard      to the west terrace, it was considered that due

         to the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                                  the

         spectator       limit       to     7,200      and with a discharge time of 6.6

         minutes it would have been                  unreasonable       to     insist        on     the

         provision       of      gangways or additional exits.                 There was total

         movement laterally               throughout       the    terrace      and     the        three

         entrance/exits            from     the terrace were well situated.                   At the

         time, the worst disaster/emergency contemplated                             was     one     of

          fire.     As     the      west       stand      provided a minimum of fire risk

          (because it was constructed in concrete) it was accepted that

         these routes would be available and adequate in an emergency.

          The existing gates in the perimeter fence were discounted for

          means     of   escape         purposes.          At    that time the gates in the

          perimeter      fence         were       considered      to   be     there        for      the

          convenience         of     the      police      for    crowd control purposes and

          suitable as a means of egress for a relatively                          small          number

          of spectators in the event of a localised incident.




          It was noted that, subject to existing crush barriers passing

          the tests, they would require special attention                             in   view      of

          the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




(iv) On 2nd April, 1979, a meeting was held between the Officer Working                                   Ex 18

    Party and the club to discuss the views                       of   the    Officer        Working

    Party in respect of the report submitted by Eastwood and Partners.




    As   far     as the west terrace was concerned, it was agreed that the

    club's proposal for additional barriers and reductions in capacity

    to   7,200    without        the       need     for    additional        gangways should be

                                   - 11 -
      implemented.             The     question       of    the     condition     of   some    of     the

      existing       barriers             and the stepping arrangement on the north west

      corner exit would be the subject of detailed                             discussions     between

      Dr Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.




(v)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 18th April, 1979 during which                                 the    club    Ex 19

      accepted       that           the     stepping arrangement on the north west corner

      exit should be rebuilt.                      The matters concerning the crush barriers

      were     to        be     reconsidered          after    it    was seen which of the crush

      barriers failed on testing.




(vi) On 1st May, 1979, the City of Sheffield Building                                Surveyors       wrote

      to     South        Yorkshire             County Council and summarised in the letter,

      their own requirements in relation to matters discussed at                                    recent   Ex 20

      meetings.               The     Building       Surveyor indicated that, subject to the

      downward slope of exit steps at the north west corner                                 exit     being

      corrected and the capacity being restricted to that agreed between

      the police and the                   club,     that     department       considered     the     west

      terrace to be acceptable.




(vii)On 16th May, 1979, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service wrote

      to South Yorkshire City Council, enclosing plans numbered 1610/12,                                     Ex 21

      1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A,                           1610/6A,     1610/4A,     1610/2XA,      Ex 22

      1610/lXA and a recommendation of work schedule to be undertaken.




      With     regard to exit routes from the west and north west terraces,

      these were considered to be satisfactory.




      The provision of exit signs was required in the work schedule, the

      siting        of        which       was     indicated    on     the   plans.     There        was no

                                           - 12 -
            requirement for such signs on the west terrace                      exits.        This   was

            because    they were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from

            what was an open terrace.               Further, none       were    required       for   the

            perimeter     fence     gates.          These were not       normal exit routes.          To

            have   exit     signs      for    these     gates    could     cause        problems     and

            confusion.



            The    schedule also detailed that adequate roads should be provided

            to ensure that speedy and               direct    access     could     be    obtained     by

            emergency       vehicles     to all exterior parts of the stadium and that

            it had to be ensured             that    parked     vehicles       would    not    obstruct

            emergency vehicles on these access roads.




      (viii)On the 8th June, 1979, South Yorkshire County Council sent a
                                                                                                            Ex 23
             memorandum to the Chief Fire officer, enclosing the work schedule

            forwarded to Sheffield Wednesday                  Football     Club    which      had    been

            collated      from    the    detailed       comments of the various disciplines

            represented on the Working Party.



      (ix) A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

            Football      Club    was    held       on 12th November 1979 when it was noted                 Ex 24

            that work detailed in the schedule dated 8th June                          1979   had    been

            carried out as far as the west terrace was concerned.




2.5   The   General     Safety      Certificate        in     respect    of     Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club with plans attached was issued with                        conditions      on    21st
                                                                                                            Ex 25
      December,     1979.     The club's attention was drawn, in particular, to the

      following conditions:




      8 (1 ) acceptance of existing first aid facilities on an interim

            basis only

                                        - 13 -
      1 2 (1 ) arrangements for emergency lighting in the south stand being

             only acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life.




      14     acceptance of police facilities on an interim basis only.




      30     no spectators being allowed to use the stadium                            in     conditions        of

             extreme wind and/or snow loadings.




             The     Fire    Services'        plans   were     sent     to South Yorkshire County

             Council for duplication and for                 attachment           to    the     certificate.
                                                                                                                     Ex 26
             Copies were returned to the Fire Service on the 4th February 1980.                                      Ex 27




2.6    (i)   On     the     14th    March,     1980, South Yorkshire County Council sent a                           Ex 28

             memorandum to the Chief Fire Officer                     stating           that    despite        the

             fact     that    the     certificate      had     been issued as recently as 21 st

             December, it was felt that the Sheffield District Officer                                  Working

             Party would have to review the situation due to the pending FA Cup

             semi-final between Arsenal and              Liverpool           on        12th    April,        1980.

             Comments       were     requested on any outstanding matters for which the

             Fire Service had primary responsibility.




       (ii) On the 20th March, 1980, Stn.O.                           sent a       memorandum           to     the
                                                                                                                     Ex 29
             Chief     Fire Officer          detailing areas of concern that were revealed

             during an inspection of the ground on                    12th    March,           1980.         These

             included:—




             (a)     training of stewards

             (b)     exit    signs not being of the required standard as detailed in

                     schedule II of the certificate.




                                         - 14 -
      (c)     non provision of fire alarm systems as required                    by     Schedule

              II of the certificate




(iii)On the 26th March, 1980, the Chief Fire officer sent a memorandum

      to    South   Yorkshire        County Council detailing what was set out in                    Ex 30

      the memorandum referred to at 2 .6 (ii) above.




(iv) On the 31st March, 1980, South Yorkshire County Council wrote                              to
                                                                                                     Ex 31
      Sheffield         Wednesday     Football       Club detailing what was set out in

      2.6(iii)      above.        Additional         observations   made     by the Building

      Surveyor were also included in this letter.




(v)   On    the   3rd     April,     1980     Sheffield     Wednesday        Football         Club   Ex 32

      acknowledged         receipt     of     the     letter from South Yorkshire County

      Council referred to at 2.6{iv) above.                  An explanation       as     to    the

      lack     of training of stewards was given stating that this would be

      undertaken on completion of the fire alarm                    system    which      was    in

      hand.       All     other     matters     in     the letter of the 31st March were

      passed to Dr Eastwood for his professional advice.

(vii)A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 10th April, 1980 to discuss the areas of                             Ex 3^


      concern recently communicated to the club and in view                       of    the     FA

      Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th April, 1980.                    The points covered

      by the letters from Eastwood and Partners on 4th                     and    8th    April,

                                   - 15 -
           were     discussed       and as far as training of the safety stewards was

           concerned it was agreed that there was little point until the fire

           warning        system    had     been    completely      installed.          It   was noted

           however that the          Fire     Service    had     given      instruction       to      some

              stewards.




2.7   On   the 3rd September, 1980 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to the

      Chief Constable outlining the concern of the                    Chief     Executive        of     the

      police policy of locking away supporters inside grounds until such time

      as home supporters had cleared the area and suggesting that instead                                of

      being      allowed to approach locked gates at the end of a match, the away

      supporters should be held back in a relatively safe place, such                              as    on

      the terrace.




      Concern      was    also     expressed       at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the                request    of     the     police,    without        the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.




2.8   On   the     16th    January,       1981,     Eastwood    and      Partners       wrote to South

      Yorkshire      County      Fire     Service     confirming       that      the      fire        alarm   Ex 35

      installation        and    modifications       to the public address system had been

      completed during July 1980.

      Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

      ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                           11th     April,

      1981. Consultations between South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the

      police had resulted in            the   production       of   an      "Emergency       Evacuation

      Procedure".        The club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to
                                                                                                              Ex 38

       A copy     of       the   procedure        is produced       dated      12th    May, 1981.         The

       procedure          detailed     the    signal     to     be adopted to inform stewards and

       police that an emergency had arisen and the actions to be                              followed       on

       hearing further announcements over the public address system.




2.10   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

       Club     was       held   on    8th    June,     1981.       It   was      noted   that following          £x ^

       experiences          at   the    FA    Cup       Semi-Final
                                                            in April, the club    were
                                                          «
       considering          revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

       stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consulted when                                 these

       had substance.




2.11   (i)            On    2nd September, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                                  Ex ^0
                       Yorkshire County Council detailing                   the     club's     proposal      to

                       instal two radial fences on the west terrace in such a manner

                       that the terrace would be divided                 into       approximately       three

                       equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                         The aim was to

                       achieve more control over supporters, a                      visiting     team     with

                       only      a    few supporters being allocated one section, with the

                       other two sections retained by the home supporters.




                       Larger        contingents         of     visiting       supporterscould          be

                       accommodated          in   two   or    all    three        areas as their numbers

                       dictated.       A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                       fence.




       (ii)           A    meeting      of    the   Officer      Working       Party was held on 11th

                       September, 1981, to consider the proposed erection of                        radial        Ex 41

                       barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                                             - 17 -
Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,                 the     police      felt

that     they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

from      the      proposals,     the    Officer    Working      Party   saw     no

objections to their implementation.




The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                        at

the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                      It    was

agreed       that      Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-




a)     further      calculations required by the Building            Authority

       being satisfactory




b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

       gates at the rear of the terrace              and




c)     the new      gates at the rear        of    the   terrace    also being

       under police control.




       It    was    clearly understood by the representatives of the

       Fire Service that these gates              would be constantly manned

       and      they    would    not     have approved the proposal if the

       situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                      the

       perimeter         fence   gates    were never contemplated for use

       for mass evacuation on to the pitch.




On 14th September, 1981, South Yorkshire County Council wrote

to Eastwood & Partners welcoming the increased control on the
        terrace that should result from the proposal                            to    instal      two

        radial      barriers       but        pointing        out     the reservations of the

        Officer Working Party                 and     the     conditions       referred     to     in

        2.11(ii)         above    that        the approval of the scheme was subject

        to.




(iv)    On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                 South

        Yorkshire         County     Council          declaring that work on the radial

        fences was substantially complete.                          Whilst this had not          been   Ex 43

        previously         brought       to     the attention of the Officer Working

        Party,      there had been three first team home games since                              the

        fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

        and were satisfied with the new arrangements.




(v)     On the 23rd         December,          1981,        the      Chief    Executive     (South

        Yorkshire County Council) sent a memorandum to the Chief Fire
                                                                                                        Ex 44
        Officer      requesting our confirmation that the                         radial    fences

        were satisfactory.




(vi)    On    the    8th     January,          1982     the       Chief      Fire Officer sent a

        memorandum to the Chief                 Executive           (South    Yorkshire     County      Ex 45

        Council)         dated     8 th January, 1982 confirming that the radial

        fences were considered to be satisfactory.




(vii)   On the 20th January, 1982, South Yorkshire County Council

        wrote to Eastwood and Partners                      commenting on the fact that
                                                                                                        Ex 46
        the matches played at the stadium since the                            installation        of

        the   barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

        and   satisfactorily             effected        the        segregation      of   opposing

        groups      of    fans.      It       was      noted      however,      that the entire




                             - 19 -
         section of the terrace had yet to be given to                             one       group    of

         fans.



         There   was        also        comment from the police that existing crush

         barriers      extended             up    to    and    completely        through          radial

         barriers      at        a    height       of 4' 6 " or so, thus enabling fans to

         easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent peris.




(viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                        &    Partners     wrote       to    South
                                                                                                           Ex 47
         Yorkshire      County Council replying to the police observations

         with regard to crush barriers being up                           to     and    through      the

         radial barriers.




         Mr    Eastwood          observed         that if the crush barriers were to be

         removed up to a distance of 1 .2m from                          the     radial      barriers,

         there      would        be     a     consequent           loss of calculated spectator

         capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                    view.

         However,       from          the     point of view of safety, a strip of that

         width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.

                                                                                                           Ex 48
         Wednesday       Football             Club     was     held on 4th February, 1982 in

         order to       discuss             the   apparent         difference      of     opinion     on

         certain      aspects           of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

         these being the observations of the                           police     in    relation      to

         crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.




         It   was    agreed            that,      on   balance, it was preferable from a

         safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                                the    existing

         barriers      being           extended up to and/or through the new radial




                                     - 20 -
              barriers than to completely prevent                       persons     being       able     to

              climb from one pen to another.




2.12   (i)    a     meeting        of    the        Officer       Working   Party     and      Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                        January,          1985,     in   Ex 49

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.




              The     club recalled the practice followed in consultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                                  the

              rear     of     the       west        stand    at     certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by             erecting        of    temporary     barriers.           This     had

              worked        well    but        in     all    other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim for                        exclusive     use    by     visiting

              supporters           of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                     supporters     was      small      and     the

              weather        was     inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.




              It was agreed that the club                     would     consider at       some     future

              date,     a     scheme       for        permanent       barriers at the rear of the

              stand.




       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                   South

              Yorkshire        County          Council,       enclosing      sketch      plan     6705/2,

              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                             the     visiting

              team's        supporters          as    they        entered   the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The     scheme        involved         the     construction        of two new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs                     of fencing      and new     gates.          It

              provided        for       separate       turnstiles for thethree sections                   of

              the west terrace that then existed.

                                        - 21 -
A meeting of the Officer                    Working      Party      was   held     on       18th

April,       1985    to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

Leppings Lane end.




The police were                already        familiar    with      the   proposals          and

indicated       that       they         had     instigated         them because of their

desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                             circumstances

dictated       and        to        achieve such arrangements for ingress that

would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.




At the meeting, the police suggested                          the     provision        of     two

further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

in half and running from the tunnel                           entrance    to     the        pitch

side     security          fence        with     gates    to permit entry to either

section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing north

end    of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

back of the terrace.




In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

radial       fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                             radial     fence       at

the    north        end        of     the     terrace    to    have two gates and the

existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

a second gate.




The    provision          of        the second gate in each of the two radial

fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                                   access

to     all      parts               of ' the    terrace       to     control     any     crowd
disturbances.          It was felt by the Fire Service however,                           that

only     one       gate in each fence would be necessary for means of

escape.




If the above features were implemented, the                          proposed           radial

barrier        running    parallel      and    2     metres          from the existing

barrier at the north end of the terrace                     could          be     dispensed

with     as    the    police     felt   that        they    would have more than

adequate control for segregation purposes with                             the     creation

of     the     smaller pens.      The creation of smaller pens was also

seen by the police to be a bonus in that                        by    having        smaller

sections       of    crowd,     their job in maintaining order would be

made easier.




At the meeting, the revised             proposals          outlined             above    were

sketched       on    to   the    drawing      by     Mr    Grimshaw, of the Fire

Service and the main concern he expressed was




(a) whether the external gates and exit routes created at the

rear    of     the    stand     would   be     adequate         for the numbers of

spectators in each section of the west stand and terrace,




(b) whether the numbers of spectators being allowed into each

section       of    the   terrace    could      be     controlled           to     prevent

overcrowding, and




(c) what arrangements were to be                made       to    ensure          that     the

gates in the radial fences would be readily available for use

should lateral movement           along       the    terrace          to    alternative

exits become necessary.
Items     (b)       and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                                     for        ensuring

that     emergency           evacuation            procedures        were          adequate          and

controlled and had               experience          with     the      club         of        ensuring

correct       crowd       density        packing.          The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                                  proposals             for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                             could

be initiated should this become necessary.                               As far as correct

density       packing         was    concerned,            the    police           stated           that

arrangements           that      they     had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                           on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the        light    of     these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                                         to    a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.




It      was         agreed       that    R        Grimshaw       (Fire        Service)             should

investigate as a                matter       of    urgency       the     means            of       escape

aspects           of      the      proposals         and     subject          to     satisfactory

clearance of these matters, the outline                              proposals                submitted

would        be     agreed       as now amended by the suggestions of South

Yorkshire Police and, to                     the     submission          of        the        necessary

detailed          plans      and     calculations            under       both the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.
(iv)   (a)   On examination of the plan              by    the   Fire        Service,      the
                                                                                                 Ex 50
             width    of    the     exit     gates    to    allow for the number of

             spectators that it was anticipated would                    use     them      was

             calculated       and it was decided that the gates would have

             to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

             With    regard       to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

             that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

             position      had      little    effect on the existing situation.

             The capacities, travel distances and                  exit       arrangements

             from the two new central pens did not change.                          In fact a

             new gate through the pitch perimeter                   fence      was    to    be

             provided.           The new radial fence at the north end of the

             terrace       did     actually     slightly     increase         the     travel

             distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

             the terrace otherwise there was no change.




       (b)   It was not thought necessary to                sign       any    exit    routes

             because:



             (i)     the    principle        ingress/egress        route would be that

                     already familiar to users, and

             (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                     stewards on the spot.




       (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

             be     necessary,       this     being reflected by the request for

             two additional gates in the newly created pens.                          The use

             of     the gates was under the direct control of the police

             and was to allow their access into                  the     terrace       should

             any     disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

             of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

                            - 25 -
            becoming       ill    or    overcome to be removed by that route.

            The police, had always been happy that                           the     gates       were

            adequate for these purposes.



      (d)   It     was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

            fence would be used for the                   evacuation of each               section

            because        (i)    the   risk        of     fire    in the west stand and

            terrace was low and (ii)                 it    was     considered           that        the

            height     and       strength      of        walls    and     gates outside the

            Leppings Lane end. were such that the                         risk       of    a     door

            being     forced       or   the      walls       scaled       and       fans thereby

            entering in large numbers was remote.                         At       no     time      was

            there any suggestion to the contrary.



             If     any      situation         arose         that       necessitated             total

             evacuation of the central pens this would in                               the      first

             instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

             i.e. the tunnel.           Should the tunnel               be     obstructed           for

             any    reason,       the    gates       in the radial fences                  would be

            used as directed by the police with                         the     assistance           of

            the public address system.




(v)   On    the 30th April, 1985, South Yorkshire County Fire Service

      wrote to South Yorkshire County Council                           indicating that             the   Ex 52

      new     crowd        control      arrangements             were     considered           to    ba

      satisfactory providing              that      certain        gates       had      widths       as

      indicated       on    the    plan     attached to the letter and that the

      gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.




                            - 26 -
(vi)     On the 2nd May, 1985, South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners             indicating that the proposals outlined
                                                                                                   Ex 53
         for crowd     control       arrangements           were    generally       acceptable

         subject to       points a — d set out in the Officer Working Party

         minutes dated 18th April, 1985, and (v) above.




(vii)    On the 8th may, 1985,             Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

         Yorkshire County Council             acknowledging the comments of the

         Officer      Working        Party      but         requesting       that      further
                                                                                                   Ex 54
         consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

         in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                            in

         an     emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

         each     occasion,        the     expense     of    which     would       hardly     be

         justified.



(viii)   On   10th    Hay, 1985,          South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners              indicating       that     the    two     additional    Ex 55

         gates     were     included        primarily at the request of the police

         who had indicated that they                 were    prepared       to     concede   the

         request     for     the     two     additional gates subject to all other

         points raised by the Officer Working Party being incorporated

         into the proposals.




(ix)     On 18th July, 1985 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

(x)     On     the    19th July, 1985, Stn.O                  noted      that plans which

        had been submitted to Sheffield                City      Council     for       Building         Ex 57

        Regulation approval were different to those discussed between

(xi)    On the 25th July, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                              South       Ex 58

        Yorkshire       County       Council   enclosing         copies     of drawings in

        Lane     end,    these being further to the preliminary submission

        in April, 1985.          Amongst these drawings            is     Plan        No.6705/8A        Ex 55

        the     terrace.        The proposed new wall between turnstile 17 and

        the rear of the west stand was shown as                    having        a     door       for

         personnel       access       described     on Plan No. 6705/14A as being a                     Ex 6C

         certain       points       detailed   in    the minutes the proposals were

         considered to be acceptable.                Item (i) made reference to                   the

             overcome possible lateral crushing hazard when                           large     crowds

             are present” "in view of experiences last year"




    (xiii)   On     1st      August, 1985,          Eastwood and Partners wrote to South                    Ex 6:

             Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                       comments         of     the

             Officer         Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood                           Ex 62

             asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

%            extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2m

             wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

             for     use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

             the 2m gap from the terrace which would be under the                              control

             of     the      police. With respect to the provision of stewarding

             for all the new gates,               (item     (j),    of    the    minutes       of     the

             29th July,        1985).        Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

             doubt be taken care of by the club.




£   (xiv)    A    meeting      of    the     Officer        Working      Party    and       Sheffield       Ex S k

             Wednesday        Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

             out the "summer” inspection and in                     particular        to    view      the

             Leppings Lane end improvements.                     The matter for clarification

             dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

             it    was     noted     that there was an existing gate in the new 2m

             wide gap for use by the police.                   Again     it     was    stated        that

             these        gates     would        still    be     available      for   the     use      of

             spectators in an emergency as the gates at                         the   top     of     the

             terrace       under     the control of police would enable spectators




                                    - 29 -
to be directed down the 2m wide gap, although it              was    agreed

that steps or a longer gate would be required.




Also    at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end            (as     discussed    at

the meeting of the 29th       July, 1985 - see 2.12(xii) above).

There    were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

at the Spion Kop end.       Unlike the gates in the fence           at   the

Leppings    Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                terrace

having     to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

calculation of evacuation time from the Spion Kop.




A meeting of the Officer       Working     Party     was   held     on   22nd

January,     1986,    to   discuss     further   development      proposals

involving the Kop and to carry out the "winter" inspection of

the stadium.



The      police      representatives     confirmed    that    the    revised

segregation arrangements to the rear of the west stand worked

well on the majority of occasions.

      half       of    the        crush       barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

      Officer Working Party.                    The matter was discussed and approval given                          to

      the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.




3.2   A    Home       Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                       Ex 66

      October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re-issued Green Guide.




3.3   A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                           Ex 67

      of     the       stadium          under       the       1975    Act.         It asked for any outstanding

      matters requiring attention to be detailed.




3.4   An inspection of the                    Hillsborough             ground      was   carried      out     on    17th

      November, 1985.




3.5   On     18th       February,             1987,       a    letter       was     sent by the Fire Service to
                                                                                                                           Ex 68
      Sheffield City Council in response to their                                    letter     of   3rd    November,

      1986.           This        was     a   comprehensive             letter      covering matters that were

      considered             as     requiring         attention             throughout        the    stadium.         In

      particular             it     was       recommended            that     a    satisfactory security davice

      easily openable from                    the     pitch          side     be    found     and    fitted    to    all

      perimeter fence gates.




                                                    - 31 -
3.6   A    meeting    of     the Advisory Group was held on the 10th March, 1987, in

      order to discuss the contents of the Fire                     Service     letter    dated     18th    Ex 10
                                                                                                            Ex 68
      February, 1987 (and Sheffield City Council's proposals for divisions of

      responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working                             Group

      (see 1.14 above).



      With regard to the letter of 18th February 1987, it was agreed that the

      contents should be taken up with the club. Stewarding and the                           securing

      of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated that existing

      arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                              and

      unlocked       for    the whole of any period that the ground was in use for a

      designated purpose.



      The Fire Service also pointed out that the new                      guide     now    included     a

      section      which      defines        in    detail, management responsibility.              It was

      recommended by the Fire Service that the club certificate specify as                              a

      condition that this section be complied with.




3.7   On    28th     March,     1987,        a    copy     of a draft letter from Sheffield City
                                                                                                            Ex 69

      received by the Fire Service for their comments.




      The    letter        referred     to       the     fact   that the police, Fire Service and

      Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                      the     condition    of     the

      stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                           At that time,

      no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

      had    indicated        that    they        were     quite   satisfied with the stadium and

      indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                           was     very

      satisfactory.




                                             - 32 -
           The    letter       then     pointed        out     that   the Fire Service had a number of

           comments to make and these were to be                      attached         in    the     form       of     the

           letter    of    18th       February.          It did not however include further points

           that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                               meeting          held     on

           10th March.



           Following       a    telephone        conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

           this omission, a copy of the                  letter,      annotated         with       the     additional

           points was returned to him .

           Council on 18th February, 1987.




     3.11 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was received from                            Sheffield          City       Council

     18th    February,          1987,       were   discussed          with Dr Eastwood who tended to

     agree with most of the points.




3.13 On 13th August, 1987, a reply to Sheffield                          City    Council's      letter      of

             of the ground were complied with, It was "difficult to imagine how

             this     task      could       be controlled by stewards" and that "the matter

             should be considered further".




     (b)     in relation to condition 1 0 (i) which dealt with stewards complying

            stated that immediate steps should be taken to                              appoint          a     Safety

            Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of the Guide and that confirmation

     replied to the letter of 21st October, 1987.                             A copy     of    their           letter

     was    received         by       the Fire Service on 26th October, 1987.                        This letter
                                                                                                                          Ex 77

                                                                                                                          Ex 78

    The     club      were reminded that as yet, no reply had been received to the

    3-17 A     letter        from    Sheffield            City    Council dated 8th February, 1988, was

         received.        The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                           3rd   February,
                                                                                                                       Ex 79
         1988,     received           from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply
                                                                                                                       Ex 80

         to the Fire Service                letter         of    18th   February,    1987.       David       Bownes

         expressed        concern          at    the       apparent     criticism    of    the     Fire Service

         contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                              suggested         that

         the Fire Service respond directly to them.



         The     letter        from    Eastwood            and    Partners    dealt with the Fire Service

         letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

         dealt        with     or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

         that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                                   the     south

         stand        was refurbished in 1991.                   The concluding paragraph of the letter

         indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                                      the

         Fire         Service         to        the       Officer   Working    Party,     new     or     different

         recommendations were being put                          forward   which    in    some    cases       openly

         contradicted the recommendations offered by                           predecessors.




    3.18 On     29th     March,        1988,          a    letter was sent to Eastwood and Partners in

         reply to their              criticism of the Fire Service.                                                    Ex 81



#
    3.19 By letter dated 29th March, 1988, the police informed the Fire                                      Service

         of     the     parking        and       travelling arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

         final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                                     Ex 82




    3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                      of

         the     ground        and made a note of their findings.                    They toured the ground

         and checked all final exits, finding stewards and police                                 in     position.

         Emergency             lighting           and        firefighting      equipment         all      appeared

         satisfactory.              The PA system was also audible                 throughout      the       ground.




                                                      - 36 -
    However,            it     was      noted     that   a    number of       stewards     were without

     identification and no log book                          was kept.




3.21 On 19th May, 1988, a further inspection was carried out at                             the     ground

     by        the    Fire     Service and the observations ofthe officer who                     attended      Ex 84

    were set out in a letter dated 25th May, 1988 which                            was     sent to       the

     local authority.



3.22 On        9th August, 1988, ADO Rowlands attended the meeting (referred to at

     Tab.15 of Volume 1 of the South Yorkshire Police documents)                                which    was

     called           by     the    police      to   discuss    the      operational      attendance      at

     Hillsborough Football Ground during the                        coming     season.    ADO     Rowlands

        stressed       that        it   was   essential      that     the    Fire Service received an

        accurate indication of the exact location of an incident                           and    what    it

        was.



3.23 By        letter dated 30th March, 1989, the police informed the Fire Service

        of the parking and travelling arrangements made for                         the    FA     Cup    semi   Ex 85


        final on 15th April, 1989.




3.24 On        3rd April, 1989, a letter dated 30th march, 1989, was received from

        Sheffield City Council enclosing a draft                      copy    of   the    final     revised     Ex 86

        Safety Certificate Conditions which as far as possible incorporated the

        comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                        Sheffield     City     Council

        dated        13th    August,      1987.      The letter listed four points for further

        consideration.

The west terrace has an are^ of 1480     which would produce a capacity
of about 8000 at 54 per 10   packing density.

When the terrace was divided by radial fences in   1981,   the   area   of
                                              m2
and when reduced by 10% 493.33 - 49.3 = 444 sq

Because there were no gangways, it was agreed that the area be reduced
by 10% for capacity calculation purposes.  This meant^ the area for
capacity calculation was reduced to 1480 - 148 = 1332
                                                                    m2
If each pen had the same area the capacity of each pen would be 444
divided by 10 x 54 = 2398 spectators assuming that Building Surveyor
allowed maximum packing density on strength and position of crush
barriers.
                                               fti2
The central pen measured 28 x 14m approx = 392      reducing this by 10%
for capacity calculation would give 392 - 39.2 » 353 . The capacity
would be 353 divided by 10 x 54 = 1905 persons.

A drawing which there is no record of the fire service having ever
received and numbered,    shows the capacities of each section. This
drawing was first seen by the fire service at a meeting called by the
local authority on Sunday, 16th April, 1989.

It Ibwed the following capacities:

south west    pen    (1       &       2 )2,600
central pen    (3 & 4)          2,200
north west    pen    (#       &      6 )1,600
north west    corner (Si C~i)     800
                 lower          _____
                                7,200

On these figures there has been no reduction (See 5) of 10% to allow
for the lack of gangways.  The figure should have been about 1905 and
is in fact 2,200. Although the figure for the whole of the terrace is
not exceeded wh^ch means that packing density on the remainder is less
than 54 per 10   based on 90% of the area of the rest of the terrace.

When the extra radial fence was added to create the 2m gap for the
police there was no reduction of the capacity shown in the central
pen.   A reduction of 2 x 14 - 28 divided by 10 x 54 = 151 persons
should have been made.

The whole thing on capacities was never tied down properly in 1981      or
1985.

                           Exits from the Crowd

At the time the certificate was issued, there were two main exit gates
out of the ground at the rear of the west stand and terrace.     There
were about 7.5 units each, a total of 15 units. They had to evacuate
the following:

West terrace                        7,200
upper part of north west            2,900
      terrace
west stand                          4,452
                                    14,552
2.   The number of people evacuated in 8 minutes would be 15 x       60   x   8   =
     7,200

3.   It would take    14,552   divided   by   7,200   =   16 minutes to evacuate
     everybody?

Joint        consultation              in t h i s   respect   should        be      taken

f ir e ,   a m b u la n c e and       other services.          It   is     essential
that      stewards        and t h e i r     supervisors      are f u l l y    aware of
the part           they have         to p l a y   in   the    plans       which          are
produced.

Management     should          ensure        that   written   instructions
d etailing    the a c t i o n      t o be t a k e n in the   event      of  an

ambulance s e r v i c e      have     expressed      a   willingness    to
assist    in      such    training       and    clubs are urged    to take
full  a d v a n t ag e of   the o f f e r .

Exercises        for    staff      and s t e w a r d s s h o u l d be c a r r i e d o u t
regularly        to ensure          the     smooth        o p e r a t o n of the p r o ­

e>       Nature        of    instruction       or    exercise.



Control   of   stewards                  should      be f r o m a  central  point
containing    e ffic ie n t               means       to      communicate   with
stewards   at    key    poin             ts     id   entified     in   discussion
between management      and              t he pol    ice.




Clubs should  appoint    a   Chief  Steward  responsible for
co-ordinating    the    duties   of   stewards   and  to  be
immediately ava ila ble  for  discussions with   the  senior

Stewards must at all times wear their official waistcoat on dnpf.

Stewards must report for duty no later than lh hours before kick-off tine.
Any Steward reporting for duty after this time cannot be guaranteed a job.
This provision may be subject to amendment in the event of major fixtures
whereupon prior notice will be given.

Whilst every endeavour will be made to allocate the same job throughout
the season, you will be expected to carry out any alternative duty as
directed by the Chief Steward or his deputy, or an official of the Club.

Duties at specific locations:
(a)   Exit gates - to be manned at all tirres throughout the match and
       opened at the specified time to allow general exit and in the
       event of an emergency.
(b)   Car park (south stand). Stewards must ensure thatthe one way
       system operates, the free passage is maintained for motor vehicles
       and supervise car parking.
(c)   Stands. Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators sit in
       correct seats (as shown on tickets). Where this is not the case,
       they have a responsibility in the first instance for requesting
       them to do so and only if there is a refusal should they
       contact the Police for assistance. Stewards are also responsible
       for ensuring that gangways and exits arC kept „c.lear.-

General Duties:
(a)   Preventing, so far as possible, standing on seats, and the climbing
       of fences and other structures. Where by virtue of the scale of the
       incident Stewards are unable to corrply with this requirement,
       they should without delay report the matter to the nearest Police
       Officer, or, if no Police Officer is present, to the Chief Steward
       or designated club official.

(b)   Where more than one Steward is on duty at the same gangway, one
       Steward is to remain at the bottom of,the steps until at least
       10 minutes after kick-off, or until any 'rush' is over, to ensure
       that the spectator uses the correct gangway and to remove any
       ticket stubs.

(c)   No gangway Steward is to sit down until at least 15 minutes after
       kick-off, and then only if there is a vacant seat on the end of
       a row in the immediate vicinity of the gangway - all other Stewards
       must sit as close to their allocated position as possible at tfie end
       of a row. No more than two Stewards may sit together .

(d)   Stewards are reminded that they should remain on duty until the final
       whistle and until their area is clear. The practise of Stewards
       leaving their positions before the final whistle will not be tolerated.
       Only in exceptional circumstances (and with the permission of the Chief
       Steward) will a Steward be allowed to leave early. Except in an
       emergency Stewards should not leave their place of duty without consent
       of the Chief Steward or senior Police Officer present who should, if
       it is considered necessary, arrange for a replacement.
     (e)    No Steward is to become involved with crowd misbehaviour. This is a
            matter for the Police - AND THE POLICE ONLY. Their assistance
            must be sought on all such occasions, and Stewards are required
            soley to identify persons who are breaking, or who are likely to
            break ground regulations. If Police assistance is refused, take a
            note of the Officer's number and report immediately to the Chief
            Steward or his deputy . DO NOT GET INVOLVED.

     (f)    Stewards do not have a responsibility for maintaining public order
            but should be prepared to identify persons to Police Officers who
            are either creating a disturbance or whose presence is likely to
            create a disturbance - this covers a wide'range of activities
            contrary to ground regulations.                        .

     (g)    At the end of the match Stewards are responsible for ensuring

            Dear Sir

            Thank you for your letter dated 13.10.83. As you suggested, 2 Fire Prevention
            Officers visited the ground before the match on Saturday 29 October to carry
            out further checks on the effectiveness of the public address system when used
            for emergency procedures.

            In conjunction with the County Police, the public address system was checked
            and found to be satisfactory in all areas.

            If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
            this Department.

            Yours faithfully

 Dear Mr. Wright,

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

 Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
 appraisal of the emergency procedure at this ground on
 Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
 came to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
 opinion there were dead areas in our ground, as it appeared
 that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
 say the least this surprised me, as only this last close
 season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

 I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
 system in all the areas that were supposedly dead, and
 I must report that everything that was said, was heard
 clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hammerton Road police of this, and it
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
to the ground at say 1.00 o'clock on Saturday, 29th
October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
selves.

Yours s in c e rely




Secretary.

Dear Mr, Sngiand,

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT           1975

Following a test and appraisal of the emergency procedure at the Sheffield
Wednesday ground, held just prior to the commencement of the Milk Cup Match
on Tuesday 4th October, 1983, please find my observations belowt-'

1.    On this occasion no prior warning was given by the Fire Service
      of the intention to test the emergency procedure. This was done
      in order that staff reactions could be observed when they thought
      that they were responding to a genuine emergency.

2.    The procedure was initiated by the announcement, over the public
      address system of the message “Will Mr, Derek Knight report to the
      Secretary'3 office”. It was cancelled approximately five minutes
      later by the announcement of "Mr. Derek Knight need not now attend
      the Secretary’s office*.

3.    My Officers questioned a number of stewards manning the exit gates
      at both Leppings Lane and Penis tone Road ends of the ground. In
      both instances the stewards had not heard the emergency procedure
      announcement and therefore had not carried out their duties in relation
      to the evacuation procedure.

4.    Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed        below,
      the public address system was not audible.

      (a)        Area between the kop and Penistone Road exits.

      (b)        Area between the west stand and Leppings Lane exits,

      (c)        Walkways at ground and upper levels to rear of North Stand.
      (d)        Areas in South Stand,

      (e)        Parking area.

     There are speakers at the rear of the west stand but these were not working
     on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at the Penlatone

              This m atter is being dealt with by

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.
Sheffield Wedensday Football Club PLC.

Following your letter dated 3rd December, I took this matter up with the Chief
Constable.
As you are aware, the County Council issued a General Safety Certificate under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, in respect of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium on 21st
December, 1979.   The detailed pre-determined Emergency EYacua^ on
drawn up later by Station Officerj           m consultation with the then Divisiona
Commander of "F" Division of the South Yorkshire P o l i c e ( C h i e f Superintenden    .
Herold), and fowarded to the Club by your letter dated 9th April, 1980.

This was done in accordance with the Schedule of Responsibilities of th®
disciplines represented on the four Area Officer Working Pantie,3 1but    course
this in no way affects the operational responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police
for "on the day" safety and security.

The Chief Constable informs me that he considered it advisable that the present
contingency plan for evacuation of all or part of the ground should be amended
slightly in that when a situation arises the police control room staff at the_
ground will now pass the following message over the public address system to indica
to police officers and stewards that emergency evacuation procedures are m force.

    "Will Mr. Derek Knights please go immediately to the Secretary's office.

 In the event of an emergency evacuation becoming necessary, & verbal message will
 then be passed by the police officer in charge at the Stadium (again via the
 public address system) giving specific instructions as to the action o e a        J
 the public. When the situation has been resolved, the all clear will
 by the following message passed over the public address system.

    "Mr. Knights need not now attend the Secretary's office.

 Whilst I appreciate that you were not consulted in advance on the minor amendment to
 the pre-determined Emergency Evacuation Procedure which I have outlined, I trus
 that you will find it acceptable.
                                                                           Yours faithfully,

                               EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all official
stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the Hillsborough Stadium
on the action to lie taken and procedures to lie followed in the event of the
possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the playing of a game when
spectators are present. The notes are not intended to be a comprehensive list
of all the action necessary, but are for personel issue to each steward and for
retention by the steward for immediate reference all the time he/she is on duty
at the stadium.
It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many and
varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/incendiary
devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground. That information may
be received or discovered either by members of the staff at the stadium, or by
telephone to the stadium, police, local or national newspapers.
IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF
THE CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a position to advise as to
whether the ‘bomb call1 is likely to be genuine or not).
Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the police
officer on duty in the "PA Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on instructions from
the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether the match is in progress or
not, will cause the following spoken message "WILL MR DEREK KNIGHT REPORT TO THE
SECRETARY8S OFFICE" to be relayed over the PA system.
The playing of     inessftcj*. will indicate to everyone present at the ground, other
than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exits.
NB: As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and both teams,
    this information should be passed to them so that the game officials are also
    aware of the possibility of an interruption in play and the significance of the
    spoken message.
On hearing the'message al! club stewards will make their way to their designated
duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will open the gates
and remain at that point. During this period senior officials will consider the ^
nature of the enisrgency alleged and will decide to evacuate all/part of the stadium*
Once that decision has been taken, but not until, the senior police officer on duty
will cause a spoken message to be relayed over the "PA System" which will have the
effect of:
(1) Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play
(2) Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the emergency and
    its location if known, and requesting all or specified sections of the public
    to leave their seats and make their way out of the ground by the nearest nonm
    exit route unless specifically directed to do otherwise by means of the "PA
    System" .

IT IS STRESSED THAT HO EVACUATION WILL, TAKE PLACE EXCEET BI-EXTREME EMERGENCY
M D ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING OwiLL MR KNIGHZD ETC.l * MAY BE PLAYED,
TTTCRTfl IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WELL ESTABLISH THE PERPET­
RATION OF A HOAX, ETC, AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE,
THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED WILL BE INDICATED BY THE FOLLOWING SPOKEN
MESSAGE "MR TYBTRW KNIGHT NEED NOT NOW ATTEND THE SECRETARY*S OFFICE".
ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR® STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL REMAIN ON
STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR 5 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES AND RESUMING THEIR
NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.
Tn the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information thair an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
immediately -
      (i) Notify the Club Secretary by telephone
       (ii) Inform any police officer
      (iii) He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
            by means of a ’Break Glass® call point
The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of audible
alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed control point the
location of the emergency,. The police controller can then deploy manpower to
investigate the cause.
In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional action
in accordance with the following points:
(A) Sound the alarm by breaking the nearest break glass call point
(b ) Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe to do so
(c)  Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire
(D) At no time mention the words ’Fire* or 'Bomb®, Remember, if you don’t panic,
     neither will the crowd
(e ) Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the assembly
     area (vnich has been specified by the Club) and report to the person in
     overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire Service and any other
     relevant emergency service which may be in attendance#

ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:

(a) Fire Alarm ’Break Glass® call points
(b) Location of the Fire Fighting Equipment
(c) Knowledge of all escape routes at their sector of the ground.

          Further to the annual inspection visits recently carried out at the above^
          premises.  I would inform you that my officers have now completed the series
          of checks required under the Act and the following are my observations and
          comments.

          1.    Fire Equipment

          1.1   Fire fighting equipment throughout the premises was                   inspected and
                 appeared to be in good order and functionable. ■

          2.    Fire Alarm System

          2.1   With the assistance of the police arrangements were made to fully check,
                 stage by stage all zones within the system.  At the time of the annual
                 inspection the system operated satisfactorily.

          3.    Emergency Lighting System

                 The complete installation was checked through on mains failure and
                 operated satisfactorily, althougu the maintenance staif could nou
                 produce any records of routine maintenance and testing.

          4.    Fire Routine and Emergency Evacuation Procedure

          4.1   Many aspects of these safety requirements were found lacking, the
                 details of which are as follows and are in contravention of those
                 conditions laid down in Schedule 2 of the General Saiecy Certiiicate.

                 (a)   Numerous stewards, when questioned about their respons.ibixii-.Les
                       under Section 9 of the Certificate, could not give correct or
                       suitable replies to the questions.  Many were not. familiar with
                       alarm call point positions in the immediate area of their
                       responsibility.

                 (b)   Many stewards when questioned could not provide the fire service
                       representative with the documents required under 9(d) of the
                       certificate.

                       In view of staff changes, more especially amongst the stewards,
                       regular training of staff must be maintained in accordance with
                       the standards laid down in Section 9 of Schedule 2 of the
                       Certificate.

     For the attention of Inspector Calvert

' ^ D e a r Sir,

    ACCESS FOR FIRE APPLIANCES - DURING FOOTBALL MATCH DAYS

    Fire Service Control, Wellington Street, Sheffield received a call from a
                            [Road, off Rockley Road, Hillsborough at approximately
    1600 hours, stating that she was concerned that the emergency services would not
    be able to gain access in response to a fire or other emergency due to the
    restricted road width caused by the parking of vehicles by persons attending
    the Sheffield Wednesday Football match.

     Divisional Officer Binnington attended the call and spoke to a Mr
     explaining that the parking of vehicles on highway is a police matter and
     how the Fire Service would deal with an incident when not being able to
     gain direct vehicle access to a premises.

    At the time of the visit, vehicles were double parked all along Rockley Road
    and Ferriby Road, which in the event of an incident an appliance would have
    only been able to gain partial access along Rockley Road, but not along
    Ferriby Road, due to the turning circle and congestion of vehicles especially
    at the junction of the two roads.

    On his return Divisional Officer Binnington called into Hammerton Road Police
    Station and spoke to Sergeant 1      | who was aware of the situation, and
    requested that I write a letter marked for the attention of Inspector Calvert.

    The Fire Service appreciate the problem that the police must have on the
    question of off street parking during match days and that this is certainly
    not an isolated incident.

    A solution to the problem may be to limit parking on one side of the street/
    roads of limited width only and no parking at the junction of streets/roads
    so as to allow for the turning circle of vehicles.  Enclosed is a form
    FS 930 which specifies appliance access requirements.



                                                                                             Continued...




                                 All com m unications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
Should you require*any further information or wish to discuss the problem
any further then please do not hesitate to contact the Officer concerned.


Yours faithfully

          For the attention of DO Binnington

          Dear Sir

          I refer to your letter dated 18 March 1987, in which you express concern
          regarding parking on match days at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

          Your comments have been brought to the attention of officers responsible
          for planning these operations and every effort will be made to ensure
          that difficulties are not encountered.

          I am sure you will appreciate that on match days, where a large attendance
          is present, difficulties are experienced in that many motorists park in­
          discriminately, despite parking restrictions. However, the position will
          be closely monitored and attempts will be made to ensure that the problems
          are alleviated.

          Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.

          Yours faithfully_______

Meeting held at Division Street Conference Room, 10 March 1987.
Present:-            D Bownes (Lie) , Mr Moor (Enviro Health) , Messr's|  ____________    (Bldg
                      Surveyors), Messr's Hildreth, Grimshaw, Binnington,              __________
                    . and       (SYCFS) ,
Contents of letter dated 18.2.87 (SYCFS - D Bownes) were discussed and agreed that
these matters be taken up with the C lub . With regard to the timber buildings
beneath stands, it was agreed that the Club be requested to remove or resite these
structures.
With respect to locked doors under the South Stand, it was agreed that this matter
would be dealt with under FP Act 1971 . Fastenings to sliding gates were also
discussed and a copy of a sketch showing a single hook arrangement for securing
such doors was circulated.  It was agreed that D Bownes would put this solution to
the Club for their comments.


that existing arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded
and unlocked during 100% of the time that the ground was in use for a designated
purpose.  Any relaxation of this would mean an insistence that panic fastenings
only be provided.
Discussion then took place on areas of responsibility and ground inspections.
On areas of responsibility D Bownes'did not want to be tied down to individual
references ana even indicated that his Department could not act independantly but
must refer all natters to the Council Committee responsible for SASG Act, Whilst
        :rs present would prefer definitive areas of responsibility (allowing that
there must be some o v e r l a p ) , David Bownes preferred to refer back to a
meeting following further consideration of the m a t t e r .
On ground inspections, D Bownes referred to the recent Lords decision that grounds
should be inspected annually, he anticipated that this would mean a much more
thorough examination than the present system of bi-annual inspections, and that this
would be backed up by inspections during g a m e s .
This was agreed by all present, but reservations about the suggestion that during
game inspections be carried out by the whole working party were expressed by the
Fire Service.   It was agreed however that one such 'during game' inspection would be
set u d and the outcome mo n i t o r e d .

It was also pointed out by the Fire Service that the new guide now included
a section which defines in detail, management responsibility.     It is recommended
by -the P.ire .Authority that the Club Certificate specifies as a condition:' of
licence that this' section be complied with.

  Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                     Facilities for the Disabled


                     In response to earlier correspondence about the accommodation
  of the disabled, at the front of the North stand, we enclose
  six prints of our drawing 9648/1 showing details of tne xateSw
  proposals.
       The sDace created by removing the front two rows of seats
  will be filled with an incombustible lightweight no-fines concrete
  with a sand/cement, screed topping.                                                        Tne ramp will be constructed
   in steelwork with open mesh flooring to give a non-slip surface
  which will also be less prone to the build-up of snow and ice.
       The timber partition shown on the original drawing will not
   be constructed and the third row of seats will be left in posiLion
   for use bv the semi—ambulant and also tnose people helping wiuh
   the wheelchairs.
        Reading through previous comments, from the members of the
   Officer Working Party, we believe that the principles of
   construction are now in line with their views. In anticipation
   of agreement to these latest proposals, and at the request of

 Dear Sir,

        Thank you for your letter of 13 October, setting out
 •the matters which were discussed at the meeting at the ground
 on 12 September. Our comments on the various matters are as
 follows (taking the paragraphs in the same order as your
 letter)
       Return barriers on radial gangways completed a day or
 two after the meeting.

                The continuation of the top crush barrier adjacent to
 grid line 14 is not considered appropriate.                                            It will be
 realised that there has to be a balance^with the need to
 permit free movement sometimes being more important than
 slavishly following the recommendation of continuous barriers
 at fixed spacing (for example the police request during last
 summer that we should remove parts of barriers at the Leppings
 Lane end).

                All perimeter sheeting now has the guard mesh in front
of it.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




               The handrail to the concrete wall on grid line 6
        is installed.

        Item 1     Done
             2     Agreed
             3     I question whether this is necessary, but
        consideration is being given to the matter, and we
        will inform you of the clubs view shortly.
             4 Although we do not regard provision of this mesh
        as being justified, we will have it installed.
             5 I have looked into this matter. This length of
        crush barrier was omitted for good reason.      The geometry
        of the existing Kop made the layout of the extension far
        from ideal.   It is not easily possible to achieve a
        proper anchorage for a post on the precast concrete deck,
        and it would be very expensive. It is accepted that there
        a small plot which has greater than recommended spacing
        between barriers, and that this is in a peak viewing
        area.   But your predecessor authority agreed that there
        should be gaps in barriers at a number of places on the
        old Kop for various reasons. We believe that there are
        equally good reasons in the present case. Perfection
        should not be expected when marrying new construction to
        an existing Kop.
             6 Agreed. We will report to you later in the season
        when a few more reasonably large crowds have been on the

  1,       Welcome and Introduction                            .

  Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
  the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
  on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
  the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
  Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
  the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
  City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
  Surveyors’ Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
  Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. I           H were welcomed and introduced to the
  remainder of the representatives present.

   Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
   the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
   in his .role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
   had obviously been occasions .when differences of opinion and interpretation
 .’.had occurred but, in .the main, 'these.had been resolved both amicably and
  constructively. ■                         '                                                                -

   For/the 'Club j .'Dr..' Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
r‘.:him ¥ell-for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwoodrs
   remarks. ^                                             .•

 : The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
, . details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded, with the letter
    dated 23rd December, 1985,.from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
  to carry .out the "winter" inspection of the .Stadium,                                          ■              ■

   Working Party meeting held on 13th November.        . ,     '

      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed. In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

     • As regards the possiblity of .unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
       frame of the new. structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom
       member was now to be omitted.- The resultant height of ovej.lO feet
       would make it very difficult far spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No.         was circulated and considered. This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height-of an intermediate or a low second rail to
      the barriers.where the drop .to the gangway below could be over one metre
      in places. He sought the Officer Working .Party ’s views N and the merits
      of the options were considered.                        «

      IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
      option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
      a height of some 200 mm.

B.   .Facilities for the Disabled                                        ;

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to*'1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so.long without any major;
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch. ^ For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest.to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might beTa visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by .the Officer Working JPiarty.>. *

Whilst accepting                                        ficer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed som# "cbr.^m as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities, for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and^correct thing"to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly-apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

Note of a Meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield^a-cfTct) held at
the Police Sports and Social Club, Niagara Sheffield, o^l3th November, 1985


PRESENT:               (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)

                        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)


1.   Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
Outline details of the roof to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
provided.

2 .___ Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
climbing over the front wall: of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
structural strengfhof such a structure would also be something of a problem.
The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

 IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
ioutlined by the Police representatives, s h o u l d be supported and
^transmitted to ffessrs .'Eastwood & Partners as the views of
 the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
 routes and flows.

that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for an increase, of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 1 6 ,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46.    The proposals to increase the
tunnel exit on the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

     (a)    adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes;
     (b)    to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents'
            toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
     (c)    to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)    to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the Penis tone Road side;
     (e)   until acceptablealternatives are    available, the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bararrangement under the control of
            s tewards.

4.   Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals hadbeen
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

5.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.




outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distri
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds. Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7.    Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out

                                        .2.

Police and the Building Authority, and reported that the Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

    1^write to confirm the concluding paragraph of my letter of 13th May, the
    discussion which took place with all the South Yorkshire Football League
    Clubs at Police Headquarters, Sheffield, and the comments made at the
    recent summer inspection of your Ground by the Officer Working Party.

    Now that the Interim Report of Mr. Justi-ce Popplewell has been published
    and advice has been received from the Home Office, the County Council would
    draw the following initial measures to your attention:-

    (a)   evacuation procedures should be reviewed in consultation with the
          South Yorkshire Police and the South Yorkshire County Fire Service
          should this not have been done already following previous discussions;

    (b)   safety stewards should

          (i)     be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating
                   to fire or evacuation,
          (ii)    be given written instructions about the action to be taken in
                   cases of emergency,
          (iii)   receive practical instruction and training appropriate to
                   their responsibility,
          (iv)    not be so employed unless they have been so instructed and
                   trained, and
          (v)     be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
                   performing their duties, effectively deployed, effectively
                   supervised and readily identifiable

                   NOTE - as previously indicated, the South Yorkshire County Fire
                          Service and the South Yorkshire Police are willing to
                          assist Clubs in these matters and, of course, paragraph 9
                          of your Club's General Safety Certificate specifically
                          relates to safety stewards,

                                                            /Contd

(c)   adequate first aid and first aid room facilities should be available
      (NOTE - paragraph 8 of your Club's General Safety Certificate requires
      that a suitably equipped First Aid Room must be provided and maintained,
      that such First Aid assistants as the Chief Constable may require - and
      not less than one such assistant for each 2,000 spectators - shall be
      available, a doctor employed or retained by the Club is available to
      attend at the First Aid Room if required and that his whereabouts are
      known to those in the Police Central Control Room, and that the First
      Aid Room is adequately signed and capable of being lit by the
      emergency power supply),

(d)   where stands made of combustible materials are in use, "no smoking" signs
      should be prominently displayed and that this should be a condition of
      entry to the Ground,

(e)   along with the emergency services and appropriate authorities, the County
      Council have been requested to consider the practicability and enforcement
      of a no-parking zone around the Ground.


                                          Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975.

I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council today,
in response to requests for information by the media on the situation
in South Yorkshire following Saturday's tragic events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
will be issued by the Home Office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the forthcoming ’summer" inspections
by the Officer Working Parties.

In the meantime and recognising that the season has ended, I would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards co be fully
aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of doors
and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.

                                                 Yours faithfully,




                                                 Chief Executive.

  SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS IH SOUTH YORKF™!-^


 Of the five FootDail League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
  Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General
  Safety Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
  Act, 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State On the
^^arrying out of improvements.

 The Bramall Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
 by the Secretary of State ^ July, 1984 on the Club's promotion to the Second
 Division. The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
 Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.

 Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
 undesignated (the Club remaining in the Third Division), but the County Council
 is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

 The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
 inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
 (comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Council
 and the District Council's Building Surveyor). Such inspections have been welcomed
 by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on safety
 matters.

^^aturally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
^ l f the recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
   which may be issued by the Home Office.

    1 .___ Purpose of Meeting

    The purpose of the meeting was to consider the response to be given to the
    proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985- and plans received
    from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
    increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
    Outline details of the ro6'f to be erected over the Spion Kop had also been
    provided.
                                ■f
    2,   Disabled Facilities                                    -----

    The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of the suggestions
    proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled. If the disabled
    continued to be accommodated in front of the North Stand, they would still
    be in the "firing line" of mis-aimed shots and any clear sheeting over the
    top of the area they occupied could constitute an unacceptable hazard to
    persons who might vacate the North Stand in an emergency situation by
    climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the pitch perimeter. It was
    accepted that the means of escape did not provide for this to be done, but
    it had to be recognised that in practice this was a real possibility. The
    structural strength of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
    The other suggestion of accommodating the disabled in front of the perimeter
    fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) was also
    unacceptable for the reasons stated by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

    The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
    lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
    to provide, say, a two-tier level landing on which to accommodate the disabled,
    with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch perimeter fence in
    front of this area could be removed, and the disabled would continue to gain
    access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and the North Stand as at present.
    This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
    toilets under the rebuilt terracing of the Spion Kop.
•   The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

    IT WAS AGREED that the proposals for the disabled, as now
     outlined by the Police representatives, should be supported and
    -transmitted to Messrs .'Eastwood & Partners as the views of
    the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
    routes and flows.

    3.   Enlarged Spion Kop

    The Fire Service and the Building Authority agreed that calculations showed
that the enlarged Spion Kop would provide for                                          ^          r gf

1.___ Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2j___ Ground Inspection.

A.   Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected'with particular reference to t]^
points raised at the Officer Working Party’s meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comnent.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The_jposition of the
Police Personnel access gateand the stepping of the face ofthe wall by
4 5 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete slabs. It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Female Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for u se by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
eitiergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enablp m a r t y r a to hp rfirer.tfid down the 2 ^ wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required. It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in the new male and female
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion of the steel columns at the rear of the Stand
should receive attention on a maintenance basis.

B.    South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the condition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the exterior wall of the Stand had been
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the non-slip
surface was to commence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.
                                  /
In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2\ kg. CO2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.
                                                                                  55

       Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. .Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details .of^repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2.      Consideration of Proposals       :                .

The   14 detailed   plans submitted were. each considered     and discussed individuall

IT WAS AGREED -1 that, subject to the following points and to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally, acceptable:-*

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)     Plan No.6705/8A — the new handrail by. Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re— aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23» and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than, the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)     Plan No. 6705/9A — the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e*S» the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

(d)    Plan No. 6705/10A - same comnents as for plan 9A;

(e) ^ Plan No. 6705/11A — no objection in principle* but details of exact
location required;

   .   Plan No. 6705/12 — no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;
                                                      I
(g)     Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated or. the plan and not by "stepsed” arrangements to give
    focrhcii?. th« prspesc.ts are satisfactory but the possible need to take
    p.3JSur£s cr. top cf fS-s wvl! to discourage persons from attempting to clisb
    over will have to be borne in mind;                                      *

    (h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
    corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
    either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
    possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

    (i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
    purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

    (j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,
    it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards*
    who must be fit, able and properly trained.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                     Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
           Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
    outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
    the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
    by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
    calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
    checking and comment.
           With regard to your detailed observations our response
    is as follows

     laj   We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
    the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in-
    the 2m wide ga^;formed by the new radial fence for use by the
    police. This' same gate will still be available for the spectators
    in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
    which will be under the control of the police.    This point may
    perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.
    (b)           The foundations'for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                                            Hal

 the way you suggest.
 (c) and (d)
       We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandalism.
       The refreshment area is under the most westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.
(f> • The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
step.

fcfl  The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
chamfers which will not form good footholds.
(hfc  Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the1precise location can be discussed on 7 August.
(xj        As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
         the matter can be discussed on 7 August.
       Your comment regarding stewarding. will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.

       Xt will be much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate wliat is intended when they see the works under
construction^. There will also be. an opportunity to see

     1      Whilst tha situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
                 0;1thoritv feels that the recognition of the group as a decision na..-n„
            boj; by the City Council is imperative if it is to rswin effective. As unde,
            the County Council however, tha terns of reference of the group would be.within

     ’    is a ^ e e d with although it is considered essential that full minuses of all
          meetings are produced and. circulated and in particular should mako-^direc.
          reference to outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that uhese
          are not ’lest' in the minutes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -         .                  '
L „ r l Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.
                        at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
t S ^L^^U       f aci Auth^ity invoked in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

                                  r,-,i t-r> rnles being defined in this way but I should
I have no obje^ : ° n ^ n . f is J zeed that particular Authorities adopt particular
make it d e a r       if^              duty tQ consult wich other interested parties
roles then they                   interest.      As I see it the Authority which carries
where there is an ove                   p         ^         ^ responsibility of advising the Council as
C e r t   ificsting Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

              ,            . ,.afr schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I   s h o u l d ^   point"out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and

perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authoritv carries out such inspections independently wxth a degree of
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. _ As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be _
encountered.

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself).  I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the wor-cing pa y
|as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority.        I propose that wnen an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be madewith .
     rvi-fpf T ieensins Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then maice arrangements for th
M e t i n g to taka place, to agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion o£ the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority.       This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I. have raised and let « have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for       me to formulate a report tot.,e
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.


 Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

     Dear Sir,                                  •         .

     Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
     the above subject.
                               -e Che meeting but I think that the general feeling was
     T l  ? h e T o U : of =; AuSh^ ? t y Evolved in the system should be defined
     perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

                                   •       roles being de^insd in this way but X snoula
      I have no                    agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
     . ;,ke it clear that if it is »gre.a   ^ P ^ ^ ^       ^     lacerested parties

      ^r e      there is an ° ^ r^ ^ 1 °ha^                    ^he responsibility of advising the Council as _
                                Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority ro-e,

      I have drawn up a draft Schedule wHich atte.pts ,                                                                 '

      1 SH U theSore°:::i o ^ y o u r comments on it. Would you please also let me know
      if^ t h e r e a r e any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.


      Moving onto ^the
      at t h e meeting on 10th March^                          y             u         I feel that one major inspection
      limited                             c«ri!d o«‘ on each stadium which should include all the
      per / « ' ‘£ “1* *                  ^ n s Jithin the scope of the legislation. To back up this
      f “ Ltfon             t h e r l   should be a number of “during performance" inspections by
      inspectio.                               there is general agreement in relation to during
      performance" inspections as they would highlight t h e performance of the safety
      Astern at each stadium whilst it is in operation.                                                         ^           ^


                                                                                                  734690 - Hr. Bounes

                                        For telephone enquiries on this rnattor pJoaia rin g      .............................. (STD Coda 0 2   )
                                                                   Telsx 5 4 2 4 3 (Administration & Laga!)

  Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
  Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
  co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
  first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it mighC be
  appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives from
  all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
  encountered.

  Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
  of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
  reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
  such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
  powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
  remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
  Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
 •myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
< Js a forum for discussion.

     ;take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
* ^Puseful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
   to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
   Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
   my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for Che
   meeting ‘to take‘place. 'Ah. agenda will he "prepared and circulated prior to ,the_ .
 " meeting and ’at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bowaes will' prepare a list
   showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
   Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

 Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
 on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
 General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

 Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

                             More emphasis on completion of works to be carried
                             and make the club more responsible.

                             The new code is very specific in management respon­

                             No objection to a preliminary joint inspection.

                             By experience at previous meetings it is absolutely
    para (v)
                             essential that full minutes are taken and circulated.

        Meeting of S.A.S.G.A.G - l6th July., 1987


        Mr. Eetfn.es-opened the meeting and stated that'the discussions would be divided
        into- four areas

        1.    Definition of Rolls
        2.    Inspections
        3.    Status of Group
        4.    Admin. Machinery of the Group


        1.    It was agreed that rolls should bebroadly defined and responsibilities
              taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
              Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

              A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

             ' Environmental Health would take a "general safety roll" and not be a
               "lead" authority.

        2.    The annual inspection is to be a joint full inspection to be carried
                 n<*£T tJr». SKci of- each seseon.

                                                                           r --■ =■•                •
              D.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis. Prior arrangements
              to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing A u t h o r i t y
              to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

        3.    The meeting was informed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
              authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

        4.    Individual authorities to correspond to the sports grounds through the
              licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
              to each "lead" authority.
\   )
              Meetings of the group will beheld at       irregular intervals depending
              on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
              authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

              Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
(c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
of the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                  Yours faithfully,




                                                  Chief Executive.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan
                                               t

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                           Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                  In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                           However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                          If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having    a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                            It is our view that in the event of
emergency/spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                     Yours sincerely.

                   Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
                   District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                                 Sheffield, on 18th April 1985



    PRESENT:               (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
               C. Calvert  (South Yorkshire Police)
               R. Grimshaw (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                           (South Yorkshire Police)
               T. Stewart  (South Yorkshire Police)
               G. Sykes    (South Yorkshire Police)
               D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)
                           (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)



    1.     Purpose of Meeting

    The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
    and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
    the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of ^
    turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
    segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
    Hillsborough Stadium.

    2.     Consideration of Proposals

    The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
    prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
    time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
    for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
    at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
    home supporters as well.

    The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
    Police representatives, subject to:-

     (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
           and the wall of the inner access road;

     (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
           visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
           central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
           pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
           to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
           secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
           on the plan to be abandoned);

     (c)    the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
            terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
            running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
            fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
            home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

     (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
            installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
            area

                                              1.
t
                    /' C'


    The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
    subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
    and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
    submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
    Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

    3.   Action

    IT WAS AGREED

    (a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
    of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
    outcome.

    (b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
    County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
    & Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
    Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
    necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
    Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

    In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meetih„

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

 Dear Mr Vaughan,
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
          Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End_
              The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team’s supporters
  as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
  their exit at the end of a game.
      We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
   drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
   turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
   and new gates.
       It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
   proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
   the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                           Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,                                                                                                                      7
                                       Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975                                                                -
                                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                pbtank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving tHe^
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.   We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by.the new radial fence for use by the
police. This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2 m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Partyrs visit on 7 August.

 (b)            The foundations"for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                     An Unlimited Company, Registered in England — No. 1833144

 the way you suggest.

 (c) and (d)
        We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
 single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
 walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
 vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
 Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
 durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

 (e)   The refreshment area is under the most westerly
 staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
 be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

  (f)     The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
 above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
 step.

  (g)     The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
 chamfers which will not form good footholds.

  (h)     Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
 object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
 the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

  (i)     As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
 and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

 (j)   Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
 taken care of by Mr. Chester.


          It will be much easier for your Working Party to
 appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
 construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
 the metal decking of the South stand.


                             Yours sincerely,




 c.c.     Mr. R.H. Chester

1.         Purpose of Meeting -

The purpose of the meeting was to consider-the'detailed-plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of Visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. 'TFwas '
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some oi: fhp wrirk had actually"
commenced. Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by ’phone that
submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2 .____ Consideration of Proposals

The       14 detailed   plans submitted were each consideredanddiscussed individually

IT WAS AGREED-- that, subject to the’.-following pointsand to the submission of
the necessary detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters .at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:-

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes
a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

(b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)   Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to"
be required;

(d)         Plan No.    6705/10A - same comments as for plan9A;

(e)     Plan No.   6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
location required;

(f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
indicated;

(g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements to give

foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to take
measures on top of the wall to discouYage persons from attempting to climb
over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i);   Plan No. 6705/17- for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,'
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards,
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

of revised drawings as follows
              6705/18A             Details of new fences on access level of west stand.
              6705/19A             Location plan for crowd security fence west stand.

              The drawings show changes in the layout of the dividing fences

behind.              The changes were discussed at a meeting in the ground
with Superintendant John Freeman, South Yorkshire Constabulary.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                    Yours faithfully,




                                                        XC-

              Dear Sir

              SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
              SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

              Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
              new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
              been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
              certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
              plan. W ' I S understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
              or club"officials.

              Should you require any further information, please do not fyesitate to Contact
              this Department.                                          ’/

                          (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)



1.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.     Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject to:-

(a)    additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
       and the wall of the inner access road;

 (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
        visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in half by a new
        central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
        pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
        to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
        secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
        on the plan to be abandoned);

 (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
       terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
       running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
       fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
       home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

 (d)    the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
        installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
        area

                                                 1.
The County Fire Service saw no objection in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

1.      Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2   .   Ground Inspection

A.      South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.      West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers.  This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace, On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Glub would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.    North West Terrace

No comments.

D.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

E.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stones
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.____Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for.approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

1 .________ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2 .________ Ground Inspection

A.         South Stand

The progress of the alterations and extensions to   the understand area of the
Stand (ndtified by the letter dated 16th May from   Mr.|           [Chartered
Architect, and commented on by the Officer Working Party through the Chief
Executive's letter dated 31st May) were noted.   The Club reported that the
contractors had stated that all except the Banqueting Suite would be finished
by the start of the season.

IT WAS AGREED that the areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at the
rear of the Stand required attention.

B.         West Stand and Terrace

IT WAS AGREED    -

(i)       That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(ii)     That the damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside security
fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired or replaced.

C.         North West Terrace

The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had been
test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February, 1984), and had
satisfactorily met the Green Guide requirements.
D.        North Stand

It was noted that a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
ramped access to the upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area
had been formed by timber screening under the stand between the outer edge of
the walkaway and the Gymnasium building.

IT WAS AGREED that the County Fire Service would investigate the acceptability
of the timber screened store area and/or the items stored, and inform Mr.
Vaughan of the outcome.

E.        Spion Kop

That part of the perimeter fencing erected at the norther end of the ramp at
the rear of the Kop to prevent access to the roofs of the new facility (referred
to at the meeting on 29th February, 1984)had been up-graded  and satisfactorily
tested to the Green Guide requirements.

The brick built screening wall in front of the Male   Toilets underneath   the
"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penis tone Road end of the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That Mr. Strange should let Mr.             have proposals in writing
for stabalising the condition of the r o o f 1or tne tunnel exit from the Kop (in
view of the Cl ub’s reported intention of proceeding with development proposals
in the comparatively near future), following which Mr.             will let
Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments.

(ii)      That the removal of loose coping stones and the pointing of the wall
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at the 11th August, 1983
inspection) should be carried out as an urgent maintenance item.

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, the damaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

(v)       That the redundant wooden post and loose wire adjoining    the walkaway
at the top of the Spion Kop should be removed.

F.       Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons during the present close season
(as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried
out.

IT WAS AGREED  that, pending the visual inspec tion of the lighting pylons,
corrosion of the base of the pylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the
adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.

It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re_ commence next
year.

3 ._______   General Safety Certificate

The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue*of the General Safety
Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
S tadium.

4 .________ Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In the more
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
The area used would remain the same.  If structural alterations were required,
the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

             Headquarters,                                          8th September 1982
             Division Street,
             Sheffield, 1.




             Dear Sir,

             I must complain most strongly about the attitude of your
             officers at Hillsborough last evening. On trying to
             approach them, they did not appear to have the time
             to be even civil.

             In the first place I would have thought it \i/as only
             courteous that someone should have contacted me to
             inform me that they were coming to the ground, and
             particularly at the time at which they arrived.

             They drove in with t\i/o cars, parked in spaces
             allocated to our regular people and so caused
             embarrassment, as I had to put these people else­
             where, plus a fire engine which was parked in the
             middle of the car park, and did not then enquire
             at our Enquiry Office, but walked through our
             Players' Entrance and through our domestic area
             without so much of a word that they were even
             present.

             I trust that on future visits you will ensure                SOUTH YCn
             that the correct approach is made.                          CO UN TY
                                                                                           ScRVICE
             Yours faithfully,                                                             V IS IO N

                  Note of a Meeting held at the. Hillsborough Stadium,
                      Sheffield on 4th February, 1982


PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd

           E. England         (Secretary)
           Dr. W. Eastwood    (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           J. Strange         (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           M s.                  (South Yorkshire Police)
           R. Herold             (South Yorkshire Police)
                                 (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                                 (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                                 (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
                                  Council)
                                 (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
                                  Council)
           D. I. Vaughan         (South Yorkshire County Council)
                                 (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Purpose of Meeting
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss^the apparent difference of opinion
on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

2.    Ground Inspection

A.    West Terrace
Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
left unsupported.

IT WAS AGREED -
(i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
current season.
(ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
be cut off.
B.    West Stand'

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED      that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.    North Stand
The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

      NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
             suspected, the point had been considered at a
             meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
             the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading

                   "the construction and width of the ramps being
                    such that they could quite^.properly be
                    regarded as elevated roadways".

D.     Spion Kop

-It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place; that
 the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
 existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
 levelled off as agreed.

E.     South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.    Items of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED      that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:—

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
theexit at the southerly end of theWest Stand (tobe done that day), as
well as the rounding off of thebrackets to  the North Stand security gates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".
(iii) The cracks"in the concrete terracing of the Spion Kop to be filled.

(iv) The wooden support to the electrical line between the brxck built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.
(vi) The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks and
exposed b a r ) .

G.    Temporary Structures
Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.
Paragraph 20 of the Club's    General Safety Certificate required T.V.cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions asmay be agreed
between the Police and the Club. The Club also were generally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.
3.    Future   Developments

A.    Police   and First Aid   Facilities
’It was likely that, follox^ing continuing consultations with the Police, the
 Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the Coun t y Council
 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
 forthcoming close season.
B.    Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penirtone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.
 C.   Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence
 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
 rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

             For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


             Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                                          Safety of Sports Ground Act
                                 Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                                 I believe the small number of points needing
             clarification have already been•discussed between
             John Strange and Mr._________                                                             One of these refer to the
             need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
             in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.   There is
             also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
             of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.   There
             is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
             maintenance repair will be carried out.
                                 Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
             terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
             crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
             it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
             over.               Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
             leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                             If all barriers
             were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
             would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.

                                                                                Registered in England - No. 1134531

    There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
    capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
    view.            However from the point of view of safety a strip
    of that width without a single crush barrier v/ould be a
    major hazard.
            It should be kept in mind that the introduction
    of these radial barriers has effected a very great
    improvement from the point of view of segregation of
    spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
    view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
     I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
    between the various interests.
            In the second paragraph on this subject you
     refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
    crush barriers.   I have not had an opportunity to check
    this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
     the word 'dangerous' is a little exaggerated and they
    do not of course protrude into* a gangway as there is no
    gangway at this position.
            With regard to the security gates around the North
    stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
    the gate width is at all critical..^ The remaining clear
    width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
    Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
    eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
    per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
    routes.   The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
    practice more than half the number tend to use jthe lower
    exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
    to the upper set of exit stairways.            The picture is that
     fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
     exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.

           There were very good structural reasons for placing
   the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
   not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
   There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
   'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
           I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
   you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
   with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
   meeting of the working party.   I will try again in the
   next day or so.

Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, or^
course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the^
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
to make the following comments

(a)         Radial Barriers on West Terrace
The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
confirm that they appear to be working we ll and satisfactorily effect t h e

*tfie Terrace has yet to be g i v e n to one group                 of f a n s .
The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4'6 or so
from the ground.. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
from one pen to another. In -ofeher places the existing crush barrier
rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

 (b)        Security Gates around the North Stand
You will recall that my                 letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
provided that the gates                 and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
impinge on the existing                 critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
saw no objection to the                 erection of the security gates.
 I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
 has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least     into the wiatn
 of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the

As the Annual winter, inspection of the' Hillsborough Stadium is due

taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

                                     and Security Gates
        The work on the radial fences and security gates
  indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
                   'teraber 1981, is now substant      Ou
                     Three first team home games have been played since the
  fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
  from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
  their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
  South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
  satisfied with the new arrangements.
   '    To increasePsecurity it is proposed that pairs of gates
  are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of

O u rR e f:   DV/SY/583/5             Your Ref:   WE/KH/3563   Date:   14 th September, 1981


Dear Sir,
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Offxcei Working^Pai <./
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to m your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.        Radial Barriers on West Terrace
Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur wiai
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whetuer the
problem was of. such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.
Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject i_o:-
 (a) the further calculations required by the Building Authority oeing
      satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);
 (b) confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
      of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

 (c)       the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
           control.
 2.      Security Gates around North Stand
 The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide^
 security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is m
 use.
 Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
 impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
 in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
 sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

                                          ■i



3.     Other Matters
Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of tne
Lottery Ticket Boxes._

(a)    Police, and First Aid Facilities
       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first ^
       aid facilities under the.North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis'on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.
       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are^
       still continuing, but it is f61t that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities a_e o
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes
       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately

       The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
       re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.
                                               Yours faithfully,

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                            n                                               r
                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                 Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

               We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
  installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.
               It is intended that these fences are so positioned
  that they divide this section of the terrace into
  approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
  entrance.
       By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
  should result. A visiting team with only a few followers
 will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
  retained by the home supporters.
               Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
  accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
  dictate.
               A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
  each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
  during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
  back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                                   Registered in England - No. 1134531

   are accupied by supporters of the same team.    When establishing
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.
        This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
   Park, the home of Newcastle United.
        We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
   within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

        Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
   various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
   must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.
        Six copies of our drawing 3563/1 together with two copies
   of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
     Thank you   for your letter of 8 September. I am grateful
 to you foraccepting our letter of 2 September   as giving
 the formal 21 days notice under paragraph 5(2) of the
 General Safety Certificate.
     Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
 be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.   Normally the
 contractor would commence on site in not more than about two
 weeks from receipt of order.   Thus work is likely to begin
 in early October subject to there being no objection from the
 County Council.
     We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
 on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
 of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
 be grateful if I could have notice by that time.

                                                                           Yours sincerely,

                   T. W. Stuart (South Yorkshire. Police)
                   D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

    1.    Purpose of Meeting

J   The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
    and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners-on behalf of the
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
    of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and '
    Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
    gymnasium was open to the general public.,

    2.    Radial Barriers on West Terrace

    Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
    approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
    Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
    from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
    opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
    gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
    of this nature.

    The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
    the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
    existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
    Terrace.

    It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
    room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
    radial barriers and gates be installed.

    IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
    thatthe Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
    two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
    on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

          (i)-       the further calculations required by the Building
                      Authority being satisfactory;

          (ii)       confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                      available at the rear of the Terrace, and
     *I
          (iii)       the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                     under police control.

3.       Security Gates around North Stand       - -:■■■-        ‘             ^

Now^that the gymnasium w a s open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at% the top of-the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the’Penistone Road
end of the Stand.- A separate gate would also be placed behind the West—
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppingp Lane.

These gates would ,be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.-

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to1 the gates and/or their supports,
hinges, etc not impinging'on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.       Police and First Aid Facilities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D, Vaughan should press- the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are tO'.-be provided.

5.       Lottery Ticket Boxes-

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr, Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

      Note of a Visit to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield,

           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1.      Purpose of Meeting
The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.      Inspection of Stadium
The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand
The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand
The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.
As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).
Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.

(c)   North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted'that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been 'protectively wrapped.

(d)   North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)   General

It was noted:-

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

                       EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and procedures to be followed
in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to
be a comprehensive list of all tha action necessary, but are for personal
issue to each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
erence all the time ha/she is on duty at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground.
That information may be received or discovered either by members of the staff
at the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium., police.- local or national
newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF THE GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR
MANAGEMENT OF THE CLUB.  (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
position to advise as to whether the 'bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
not).

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the
police officer on duty in the "P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
the match is in progress or not, will cause the record 'THREE BLIND MICE* to
be played over the loudspeaker system.

The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground, >
other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

N.B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
       both teams, this information should be passed to then so that the
       game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption in
       play and the significance of the playing of the record.

On hearing that record all club stewards will make their way to their des­
ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will
open the gates and remain at that point. During this period senior
officials will consider the nature of the emergency alleged and will decide
to evacuate all/part of the stadium. Once that decision has been taken, but
not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
be relayed over the :,P. A. System" which will have the effect of:-

(1)    Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play;

(2)    Informing the spectators/officials of the prccise nature of the
       emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
       sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
       the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
        to do otherwise by means of the :’P. A. System".
U Y S |#1
t




    IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT IN EXTREME
    EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
    MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
    ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OP A HOAX, ETC., AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF
    A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE f THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED
    WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 'TEDDY BEARS PICNIC'.
    ON HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR' STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL
    REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
    AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

    In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
    information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
    immediately -

      (i) Notify the Club Secretary by telephone;

     (ii) Inform any police officer.

    (iii)   He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
            by means of a 'Break Glass' call point.

    The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of
    audible alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed
    control point the location of the emergency. The police controller can
    then deploy manpower to investigate the cause.

    In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional
    action in accordance with the following points:-

    (A)      Sound the alarm by breaking the nearest break glass call point;

    (B)     Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe to do so;

    (C)     Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire;

    (D)     At no time mention the words 'Fire' or 'Bomb'.   Remember,   if you
            don't panic, neither will the crowd;

    (E)     Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the
            assembly area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to
            the person in overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire
            Service and any other relevant emergency service which may be in
            attendance.

    ALL STEWARDS MUST FAMILIARISE THEMSELVES WITH THE LOCATION OF:-

    (a)     Fire Alarm 'Break Glass' call points;

1.        Purpose of Meeting

Bearing in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which, was to take place on Saturday,
11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to
visit the ground, especially a s 'a small number of matters had arisen since the
last visit on 10th February, 1981.

2 .____   Inspection of Ground

(a)       South Stand

The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
the Ladies' Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand,and the batteries
supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

(b)       West Stand

As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
at the ground.

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the
apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the
stand, the cracks in the concrete #t the top bo both sets of stairs, as well as
the currently slight corrosion -in the base plate of the outer steel column
(nearest to the South Stand) had all been' included in the maintenance programme
and would be undertaken shortly.'
(c)     North West Terrace

The cracking of the concreting had been attended to by injecting material rrom
the top.  The results had been satisfactory, except in two small areas vnere
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.

(d)     North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would De
attended to shortly.

(e)     Spion Kop

The infilling of the step    adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop   would be given attention in       the   close season.

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use.  It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created.  As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps.  In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled ofr.

3      ^Gjrotind Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills"
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure".  The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

Dear Mr. Brownlow.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I have noted with concern racent media reports on incidents at football
matches, particularly at the recant one at Hillsborough between Sheffield
Wednesday and Newcastle United when a number of your officers received
injuries after the natch had ended.

I fully appreciate the reasons why the police, both in South Yorkshire and
elsewhere, consider it preferable to contain possibly troublesome fans
(usually vis ting supporters) after a natch has ended within a ground rather
than risk hooligan!sn, violence and damage outside the ground. However,
the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" issued by the Horr.a Office does
reccciBsnd in paragraph 6.14.3 that all d o o r s on ar. e::it route should be
secured in the fully open position before the end of play, ar- it is
generally recognised that the period of greatest risk to crowd safety at
football grounds is at the tine of leaving.

I an anxious that both the South Yorkshire Police and Football Clubs
should not be put at risk, either nhyscially or legally, by the "locking
in" procedure.  Indeed, the Hillsborough Stediun General Safety Certificate
requires (in paragraph 10) that all doors and gates which form an egress
route should be opened and secured in the fullv o-->en position at a time
oefore the end of a match agreed between the Club and yourself.    I would
suggest that if the practice is to be continued, consideration should be
given to the departing spectators being held back in a relatively safe
place, such as on the terrace, rather than being si loved to proceed to
the point of exit (as suggested by the Guide).

As you are .aware, the County Council set up four Area Officer Working
Parties to exercise its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act, 1975, the South Yorkshire Police being represented at both
Headquarters and Divisional level on such Working' Parties.

I would be the first to admit that, in the absence of designation of other
than the Hillsborough Stadium, progress in advising the other four football
clubs in South Yorkshire on the whole of the requirements of the Act has
not been as rapid as I would have liked.  This has not generally been helped


J. H. Brownlow, Esq.,

by the attitude of the Clubs who, whilst accepting the principle, seam
reluctant to spend money on ground improvements which will bo required
when designated but do not constitute an actual danger at the present
time.

On a more specific point, I understand that extensions to the barriers
at the foot of the Spion Kop at the Hillsborough Stadium designated
ground have been added at the request of the police, the wire mash at
the top extending beyond the edge of the frs:re,

I .have no record of the Sheffield Area Officer Working Party being
consulted prior to the Club being requested to undertake the work*
I mention this as it could be a source of eicbarrassxnent find lead to
accusations of inconsistency as the Sheffield Area Officer Working
Party at a meeting on 26th October, 1979 reccnxandad against mesh
protrusion in the Sheffield United Pitch Security Fence. At that meeting
you were represented by Superintendents J. W„ Gavins and T. Johnson,

To avoid any misunderstanding, I would stress that the foregoing is in
no way intended to be a criticism of the traditional role or cethod of
policing of football grounds or an attempt tc intrude in your
operational responsibility.  The views expressed are out forward in a
constructive spirit and in the hope that you will agree to the police
continuing to contribute to the Officer Working Parties and so achieve
consistency on all aspects throughout the County.

So far as recent r.edia reports as to the setting un of ensreine meetings
with the five South Yorkshire Football Clubs to" ceVibat hooliganism are
concerned, bearing in nir.d the eventual designation of all football
grounds by the Secretary c-f State, I hope yen wi 11 agree that it would
be useful if the County Council were to be represented at such meetings
by the Co-ordinator of the four Area Officer Working Parties, Mr. D. I.
Vaughan of ny staff.

                                      Yours sincerely,

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

In view of the F . A . Cup S em i-F in a l at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
v is it s by the d iscip lin es rep resented on the Working P arty, the Chief Executive :f the
South Y orkshire County Council had ra ise d with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
m atters which apparently w ere s t ill outstanding.

A le tte r of reply dated 3rd April had been r e c e iv e d from the Club, as w ell as le tte r s dated
4th and 8th A pril from the Club's Consultants, M e s s r s . Eastwood and P a r tn e r s, giving
d eta ils of the p resen t position.

2 .______ Inspection of Ground

The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's rep re se n ta tiv es.

(i)        Training of Safety Stewards

           The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
           Stewards until the fire warning s y s te m had been com pletely in stalled , but with
           agreem en t the County Fire Service had instructed som e stew ards yesterd ay.
           A schedule specifying the duties and r esp o n sib ilities was handed to the Club's
           r ep re se n ta tiv es.

(ii)       Exit Signs

           The Club's rep re se n ta tiv es felt that the exit sign s gen erally had been sited where
           required and w ere of adequate s iz e an d /or illuminated.

           It was agreed that there w ere a number which could be m ore advantageously sited
           an d /or illum inated, and so m e which might be m ore effective with la rger lettering

              an d /or d irection arrow s. The County F ire Service undertook to li a is e with
              M e s s r s . Eastwood and P a r tn er s.

    (iii)     E m ergency Lighting in the South Stand

              A s was evident, com plete r e -w ir in g of the South Stand with separate circu its had
              already com m en ced , and the County F ire Service undertook to let M e s s r s . Eastwood
              and P artn ers know their detailed req u irem en ts.

    (iv)      F ire Warning System

              The F ire Warning System had b een in stalled , except for the trickle charger and
              battery equipment. These item s had been subject to d elivery p rob lem s, but the
              s y s te m should be com plete by the end of the month.

              It was agreed that as regards the F . A . Cup S em i-F in a l, the P olice Communications
              b a se which would be at the ground would a ls o be used for F ire Service purposes if
              necessary.                                                                     ^

    (v)       Sealing of F ire R esistin g F ram es

              The sea lin g of the fire r e s is tin g door fra m es against the supporting w alls had generally
              b een carr ied out, but there w ere a sm a ll number which w ere now showing sign s of
              s m a ll gaps.

    (vi)      F ire Retardent Paint

              The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had b een specified on the
              partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors w ere on holiday until
              14th A pril, it was not p o ssib le to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
              b een used.

    (vii)     Wired Glass

              The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired g la s s had been used                |
              w h erev er required by the County F ire S erv ice.

              The County F ire Service and the P o lice w ere gen erally sa tisfied that the sm a ll panes
              of g la s s in the upper half of the wooden partitions within theSouth Stand would not in
              normal circu m sta n ce s be regarded a s a fir e an d /or safety hazard.  The Club agreed in
              the longer term to consider the fitting of wired g la s s and, in the short te r m , to
              con sid er fitting wooden battons as an in terim m ea su re.

     (viii)   Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West          Stand

              Whilst there w ere a number of sharp c o rn er s on the supports, th ese w ere at a height
              of at le a s t s e v e n f e e t. How ever, the Club undertook to round them off.

     (ix)     P e r im e te r Fencing on the Spion Kop

               The Club pointed out that this had been tested where fea sib le and the r e s u lts forwarded
               to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been p assed to the Building Authority on
               30th January.                                     .    .   .

       t
(X)        P o ssib le Step Obstruction on Upper Exit A rea on Spion Kop

           Whilst it was agreed that the e r e c tio n of the b a r r ie r s at the Upper Exit A rea had left
           a sm a ll adjacent a rea of approxim ately one foot wide by four foot long at a low er le v e l
           than the rem ainder of the e x it, it was felt that its p osition coupled with the crowd
           flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
           undertook to give attention to it in the longer term .

(xi)       Mesh Fencing under North Stand

           In view of the normal crowd flow ra tes on the public side of the m esh fencing and the
           fact that there was no public a c c e s s to its r e a r , it was felt that the tim ber framed .
           m esh fencing under the North Stand providing secu rity to storage a rea s was acceptable.

             Dear Mr. Mallett

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

             Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
             is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
             appreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
             opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
             the above act work has been going on continuously since
             it was started last summer and at no time do I feel
             that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
             everything that has been promised to be done.

             To take Item 4 of your letter •» this is very much in
             the progress, and we axe in the hands of the contractors.

             As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
             left until the warning system was installed. However, on
             receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
             suggested that if he would like to contact the County
             Fire Service, all our stewards would be at the ground
             for our match on Easter Monday, and that might be an
             opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
             officers of the Fire Service had intimated to me
             previously that any time would be suitable to them.

           All your other items under Paragraphs 2 & 3 will be
           dealt with, and in fact a copy of your letter I have
         ‘ sent to Dr. Eastwood for his professional advice.

             Yours sincerely,




             Secretary.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


     Dear Mr. Vaughan,                           •
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                         Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                Mr. England has sent me a copy of your letter of 31
     March and of his reply dated 3 April.
          I am in a little difficulty in replying to some of the
     points raised as Mr.                                                  .s on holiday until Tuesday, 8
     April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
     Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
     and Mr.        is better equipped to deal with the comments on
     the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
          With regard to the comments from the Building Control
     department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
     Strange returns from holiday.   However, my first comments
      are as follows
       (i) The cracks between the door frames and supporting wall
           will be re-inspected. I can only assume that this is
           something which was not noticed in the„inspection which
                 we made and the inspections which were made by the
                 Building Control department at the end of the work.                                                                          It
                 may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
                 gap has opened since that time.                                                 We will, of course, have
                                                        Registered In England - No. 1134531
                                                                   SHEET



EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




         the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
         might I suggest that minor matters of this kind do not
         need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
         periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
         out.   . After all the next inspection is less than three
         months away.


    (ii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the
         south stand partitions with the Contractor, who is
         closed down until 14 April.    However, one of my assistants^
         believes that M r . J h a s       recently told Mr. Strange
         that Mr. ______ saw a painter with a tin of Dulux instead
         of the Nullifire which we specified.     It would have been
         appreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
         so that we could have checked with certainty and if
         necessary taken corrective action.     I will write to you
         again on this point.


    (iii) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr.            had queries in a
         recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
         used where appropriate.    Mr. Strange said that so far
         as we know wired glass had been used everywhere that the
         fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer
         had of course, made his own inspection.      The conversation
         had ended with Mr.            saying that he would check with
         the fire officer.


    (iv) We presume that the reference to 'clearance' refers to
         the vertical headroom.    It will be recalled that some
         ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
         we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand

           the Building Control department for comment.        They
           inspected during construction and after the work was
           completed.    I am not amused by the fact that the
           headroom is now being queried.     In any case this is
           a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
           department.   With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
           we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
           as the season is now almost over, and there is no
           time to agree further work and have it carried out before
           the season ends.


     (v)   The perimeter fencing at the north-east c o m e r of the
           Spion Kop has been appraised for condition and strength.
           Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
           the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
           we are dealing with an existing ground, the fence is
           satisfactory in my opinion.


     (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
           this is something which is obviously dangerous      (in
           which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
           last December) suggest that discussion be left until the
           June/July inspection.


     (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
           with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
           satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
           making of changes.


         I will write to you again after Mr. Clough returns from
    holiday.

 For- the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan



 Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                         Safety of Sports Grounds Act - 1975
               I have now been able to talk with Mr. Clough regarding
 the exit signs and have pleasure in replying to your points
 ii, iii and iv.


 Para ii
               I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
 of John Strange who is still                                               on holiday.            I have quickly
 looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
been able to find any reference to lettering size.                                                            Because
 you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
 accordance with the plans it is a little difficult for me to
 comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until
 John Strange returns.                                       With regard to the illumination of the
 exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
 the South Stand and it may be that the signs you have in mind
will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
work is complete.



                                                          Registered in England - No. 1134531
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




   Para iii
          We have not been able to understand what it is
   which you say does not comply with the requirements
   of paragraph 12 of the certificate.      The agreement
   with the Fire Service    (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
   letter of 12 December.      So far as we can see the only
   possible variation from that agreement is that because
   of the rewiring which is now taking place We did not
   implement the agreed measures in the case of the two exits
   referred to in the fourth paragraph of our letter of 12
   December.


   Para iv
          The fire warning system is complete except for the
   supply of the trickle charger and battery equipment.        These
   items were ordered some months ago and if the original
   delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
   by now.      Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
   deliver on time.      We have been applying appropriate pressure
   and the latest information is as set out in the attached
   copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
   24 Ma!rch.     As you will see from this, two of the four
   outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
   but the signal indicator panel was not expected for four
   weeks from 24 March and the industrial batteries complete
   with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due to be
   delivered by Friday, 25 April.


          I understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
   on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                     Yours sincerely,



   c.c.    Mr. E. England

                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.


                      Following an inspection of the above premises on the 12th of March, 1930
                      by Station Officer |           and myself, the undermentioned conditions
                      under the Act_were, still outstanding.
                                 '.'•I ■r; itA.t
                      1. The training of safety stewards had still not been completed,
                          Mr. England (Club Secretary) stated that the safety stewards ware
                          familiar with most of the requirements but had not yet received
                          instructions on raising the alarm or the correct method of extinguishing
                          a small fire.

                             These requirements are indicated on Schedule II section 9                                                        aoove
                             Act.

                      2.     Some of the exit signs do not come up to the required standard as
                             indicated in Schedule II section 11 (l) of the above Act for the following
                             reasons:
                             (a) Some of the signs have inadequate lettering sizes and are not in t h a
                             positions indicated on the requirement plan.

                             (b) The exits at the rear of the south stand were not illuminated by
                             both the normal lighting or4the emergency lighting.

                      3-     Parts of the south stand and gangways leading from it are still not
                             illuminated by both main and emergency lighting as indicated in
                             Schedule II section ll(2) of the above Act.

                      4.      Ho fire alarm systems have been provided as required by bcnedule II
                              section 13(l) of the above Act. Hr. fiigland stated that they have put
                              out for tenders for the installation of the fire alarm system, but did
                              not expect the work to be complaisd before the F.A. Cup Semi—.2inal.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club


Following an inspection of tha stadium by officers of the Fir®
Service I am concerned to note that the undermentioned work la
atill outstanding*
1.   Although the Club bias informed that the Fire Service
     would be willing to assist in the training of safety
     stewards as to their actions in an emergency as
     required by Schedule 2, Section 9, of the safety
     certificate issued by the County Council, no progress
     has been made in this matter*

2.   It was required that exit signs of suitable size
     should be provided and their positioning agreed on
     situ. The safety certificate stipulates that the
     signs shall be provided and maintained to tha
     satisfaction of the Chief Fire Officer*
     The recent inspection,has discovered that without
     further discussion, some signs having inadequate
     lettering size have been provided and the siting has
     not complied with the detail of the certificate plan.

     The signs at the rear of the South Stand are not
     illuminated by both the normal and emergency lighting.

     These items do not appear to satisfy the requirements
     of the safety certificate.
3. The emergency lighting provisions in the South Stand
   ” and the gangways leading from it do not comply with
     the requirements of the eafety certificate.

4. No fire warning system has yet been provided to satisfy
     the requirement of Schedule 2, Section 13(i) of the
     safety certificate.
     Mr. England, Secretary to the Club, has stated that
     they have put out for tender for the installation of
     a fire warning aystara but did not expect the work to
     be completed before the Football Association^ Cup
     Semi-Final.
 As the conditiona attached to the safety certificate are not being
 satisfied you may wish to have the Club clarify the situation in
 writing*

           Confirming the conversation which Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff had yester-"'.
           with your Assistant Chief Fire Officer (Fire Prevention), Mr. H. E, \h: i -..
           you will be aware that it has been announced that the F.A. Cup Semi-5 in.-l

           12th April.

           Despite the fact that the Certificate in respect, of the Stadium was L?zixo~s
           as comparatively recently as 21st December, 1979, I feel that the

           comments on any outstanding matters for which they have primary response.r.i!

  Lear Sir,

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground,
  Hillsborough, SheffieId

  I refer to recent meetings with regard to the improvements required at the above
  ground and now append a summary of matters, in relation to the Building Authority
  requirements, which require attention and have been discussed at the various
  meetings.

  West Terrace

  1.        The downward slope of the exit steps to he corrected.

 2.         Limitation of numbers as agreed between Police representatives and club.

  Subject to these two points this area is acceptable.

 Wo ;--t,   St an< 1

 Provision of additional stairways for egress purposes is required.  Subject to
 this provision the slight shortfall on headroom in certain cases can be accepted.

 South Stand

 1.         Removal of divisions between areas of seating is required, and following
            this the general arrangements of egress provisions can be appraised.

 2.        Areas of badly spalled concrete to be repaired.

 3-         Corrosion to steel columns to be investigated and its effects assessed and
            repaired as necessary.

 4.         All balustrades and walling to be subject to test and strengthening as may
           be revealed.
                      if -.
 5.        Additional handrails to be provided to main entrance stairs and to stairs
            from first floor to stand.

 6.        Consider raising height, of front wall opposite foot                                                       of each gangway.

 7*.       Additional egress to be provided through tea bar to                                                        foot of main stairs.


                                                                                                                               P.T.O.

The officer dealing with this correspondence is ................................................            .. . . Tel 7 3 .    ..   (STD Code 0 7 4 2)

                                                            G. R. Ada m so n, Chief Planner.       C. J. Dorrell, Chief Civil Engineer.

          D. J. Rhodes, Chief Q uantity Surveyor.                   J. N. Stenton, B u ild in g Surveyor.      T. N. Blackmore, Group Secretary
South Terrace

Provide new means of egress to South-East area as discussed in detail.

North Stand

1.    Radial gangways to be improved to 1.1 m in width for at least half the
       gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
       below each exit to allow for barrier erection.             . . .

2.      Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers
        complying with guide recommendations.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed to require these.

North-West Terrace

1.    Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.

2.    The removal of under-strength barriers and their replacement by   new ones
       constructed to guide recommendations.

Spion   Kop


1.    The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
       not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
       if the other requirements are fulfilled.   These other requirements include
       the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an
       additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
       to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.    Make good all broken and spalled concrete terracing.

3.    Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

/].   Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
      building.

5.    Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
      recommendations.

6.    Improve egress conditions at rear by px-ovision of balustrades, rails, etc.
      as indicated on the plan.

General

1.    All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
      replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.    Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
      assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3.    Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
      as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
      out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
      from under stand areas.
With regard to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co—ordinator, should chair such: meetings.

Yours faithfully,




building Surveyor

The Note (previously c irc u la te d ) of the m eeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
in conjunction with a Note (circulated a t the m eeting) of a m eeting between Eastwood
and P a r t n e r s , the South Y o rk s h ire County F ir e Service and the City of Sheffield
M etropolitan D is tric t Council Building S u rv ey o r's D ep artm en t held on 13th A p ril, 1979.

The Note of the m eeting held on 2nd A p ril, 1979, was a g re e d , subject to the following
am endm ents and additions in the light of the fu r th e r investigations and d is c u s s io n s :-

2A      Spion Kop

P a r a s . 1 & 2 - R evised copies of draw ing no. 1610/IX w ere c irc u la te d a t the m eeting
showing the proposed new c ru s h b a r r i e r layout, including the two lines of ra d ia l
b a r r i e r s . This was AGREED in p rin c ip le .

P a r a . 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop a s existing would m ean an unacceptable
evacuation tim e of som e 12^ m inutes. L a r g e r and re -a lig n e d g a te s in the b a r r i e r ^
and im pro v em en t of the existing upp er exit could reduce this tim e to so m e 10 m inutes,
but 8 m inutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 m e tre o v erall width.
This could be in te g ra te d into the prop osed future schem e for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give co n sid e ra tio n to the p ro p o sa ls.


                                             1.
O v P
P a r a . 4 - The e x p lo ra to ry w ork re g a rd in g the im pro v em en t of the headroom had
s till to be c a r r ie d out, but was not expected to be a m a jo r item .

P a r a . 5 - B ecause o f the difficulty in devising a suitable m ethod of testing in p laces
(such as the top of the Kop), it was .AGREED that p ro posals should be fo rm ulated
a f te r f u r th e r d isc u ssio n s betw een D r. Eastw ood and the Building Surveyor.

P a r a . 6 - The Club accepted th a t the c o n crete re q u ire d attention and th a t the s c o re b o a rd
s tr u c tu r e should be looked a t. It was AGREED th a t the question of the height of som e
of the c ru s h b a r r i e r s be c o n sid e re d again a f te r it was s e e n which of them failed on
te stin g .

P a r a . 7 - The Club s t r e s s e d that th e ir p ro p o sa ls fo r the im provem ent of the m eans of
e g r e s s would hopefully be c a r r ie d out in the s h o r te r r a th e r than the longer te rm future.

P a r a . 8 - The Club hoped th a t the te stin g of the existing c ru s h b a r r i e r s , to g e th e r with
the in sta lla tio n of the new c ru s h b a r r i e r layout and a lte ra tio n of the g a te s in the e x isti
b a r r i e r , could a ll be c a r r ie d out in the close se a s o n . T h e ir aim was to achieve a
1 6 ,8 5 0 crow d capacity.

2B       W est T e r r a c e

P a r a . 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the c r o s s - f a ll on the n o rth -w e s t c o rn e r
exit, the ste p s should be r e - b u ilt. It was AGREED th a t the oth er m a tte rs would be
co n sid ered again a f te r it was s e e n which of the c ru s h b a r r i e r s failed on testin g .

2C       N orth W est C orner T e r r a c e

P a r a . 2 - W hilst accepting the need fo r the im provem ent o r re p la c e m e n t of the
e xisting c o rru g a te d sh eeting, the Club fe lt they wished to c o n sid e r w hether to c a r r y
out m o re extensive w orks so as to bring the existing unused a r e a into use fo r an
additional 250/300 s p e c ta to r s .

3.       N orth Stand

P a r a . 1 - D r. Eastwood, the Building S urveyors and the F ir e S ervice had re a ch e d
a g re e m e n t on a sch e m e which could be reco m m en ded to the Club. This would
involve the re m o v a l of 10 s e a ts from e ach of the 9 gangways and 4 s e a ts from in
fro n t of each of the 9 u p p e r e x its . The r e s u lt would m ean a loss of 126 s e a ts

c o n sid e ra tio n to the p ro p o sa l.

 P a r a . 2 - The word a t the end of the f i r s t line should have been ’T e a ’ and not 'T e am .
 It w a s AGREED that D r. Eastwood and the F ir e S ervice would discu ss in detail any
 fire p ro te c tio n w orks c o n sid e re d to be n e c e s s a ry .
4.     West Stand

The Club AGREED that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
provided from each end of the upper stand.

5.     South Stand

Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was AGREED        that all bases would be exposed for
inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
Club also AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, it was AGREED that
it would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes in the upper part
of the stand (the covered area).

Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
outer edges of the main staircase? that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be installed.
It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
surge pressure could be generated.

Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was AGREED
that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
snackbar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance measures in the
surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
avoid any loss of seats.

6.     Ground Exits

The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

7.      Communications

The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
address s ystem. It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

 8.     Police and First Aid Facilities

Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects
to receive first priority and to wait for the 19S0 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr.           |iad not yet completed his investigations
into the first-aid and medical facilities.

9.     Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.'   Future Action

Mr. McGee stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistance under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,000 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, if implemented, appeared to give a capacity of some 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Euilding Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.                                                                        •.

               H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.    Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to make the Stadium the best in Europe, Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had made the Club
viable, and itwas hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club's
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, itwas essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
0   \^}p

      c f-C
       I
2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the aim should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

3.    That as much work as possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah's Witness Rally had
also to be borne in mind.

2.   Discussion on Standing Areas

A.   Spion Kop

IT WAS AGREED -

1. That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be installed be the subject
of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

2. That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.    That, in view of the clearance time of Ilf minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-siting of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an increase in their number).

4. That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5. That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.   That the condition,of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club's longer term proposals for the improvement of the means of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.
B.    West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Club's proposals for the Installation of additional barriers and the
reduction in capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be implemented.

2.    That the question of the cross-fall on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as well as their corrosion
and sharp edges in places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner Terrace

IT WAS A G R E E D -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new barriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be implemented.

2.    That the improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That, in view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party as to the appropriate steps (Ifany) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sides be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-consider the matter at the next meeting.

2.    That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
Room be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
Fire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-Aid Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted in principle, and
that the facilities required in the new permanent structures be considered later in
the Agenda.

4.    That the existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.   That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.
4.    West Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied in the required time,
consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency use, rather
than for normal use).

5.    South Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss in detail the apparent
spalling of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for inspection (2
only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
single and double skin walls.

2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
seats or some such alternative.

3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.

4.    That the means of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.;

5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

6.    Ground Exits

Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
circulated without delay.
7.    Communications

IT WAS AGREED That consideration would be given to the installation of an
improved public address system, with the Police having access to its control
from their Control Room, together with its use as a fire alarm system, subject
to an emergency back-up system in the event of failure.

8.    Police and First Aid Facilities

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
              t
First Aid Facilities.

2.     That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their initial
sketch plan showing the facilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
inspect the existing first-aid and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

9.    Any other Topics

IT WAS AGREED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the existing
and any proposed emergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.
                          (        \
10. Future Action

The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work as possible before
the issue of the Certificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done
it was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

11.   Date of Next Meeting

IT WAS AGREED That the next meeting should be held at 2.30 p.m. on
Wednesday, 18th April, 1979, at the Stadium.

                       ■■■  ■


Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
date, the purpose of the meeting was to review the position since 12th Febvuai
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2   .      Plans

The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still under
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

3.         R eport
(a)        General

The County Council had contacted the Home Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
thei*- had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not
lower than that set out in the Guide. However, the maximum flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.
(b)      Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was AGREED that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11, 040 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On the question of exits, it was again AGREED that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the embankment at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was AGREED
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was AGREED that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was AGREED that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2x2 could
reluctantly be conceded. The Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

The fact that the height of many of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in some cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was AGREED that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      The West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

A s well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. The cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as ittended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was AGREED that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)      The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having now had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
         The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

The removal of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

As the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

(f)      The West Stand (page 7)

Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion^ it was AGREED
that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unlt exit width, it was AGREED it was not necessary
to insist it should be on the south-west corner. Such staircases could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
AGREED that a ^ reduction in capacity would be necessa^.

(g)      The South Stand (pages 7& 8)

As mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
need for reasonableness and to make the situation better, it was AGREED
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The Fire Service pointed out and it was AGREED that Fire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the Directors' seating, and 1 hour fire
resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to J hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork cf the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spailing which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was AGREED all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

As well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
from a means of escape point of view ifthe capacity of the North Stand
was not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
etc., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr.|             [•Specialist
in Community Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday uutil
2nd April, 1079. He had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practicaldifficulties might
prevent his doing so.

1.     Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Report, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W. Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting was to consider the views which the Working
Party should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2. ___ Plans

(a)    Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, some of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the same scale, and it was AGREED that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be amended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)    The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
indicated on that plan.
0.^-9   ■
(c)    It was AGREED thatthe planssupplied hadinaccuracies               and
inadequacies. In particular, they lacked indications of cross sections, ^
profiles, structural stability, p o s i t i o n of handrails and balustrades, widtn.
of stairways, etc. Where appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Report.

(d)    The County Council’s hopewas that,in view of limitedresources in
the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3.     Report

(a.)   General

Itwas recognised that the criteria set out in the Home Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required new work or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterton was that of a reasonable degree of safety.
As the Guide stated, itwould be unreasonable, even if it were practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow of spectators was the most important criteria to be adopted.
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, ISe Building Authority suggested
ftwould be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation In the
Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide. The County
Council AGREED to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
AGREED they would contact their colleagues in other areas who had been
involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective areas.

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also AGREED to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
time.

 (b)     Front Cover

 Whilst it was probably a typing mistake, itwas AGREED that the wording
 on the Front Cover should read "REPORT TO SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY
 COUNCIL" and not "REPORT OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY COUNCIL".

    (c)    Spion Kop (pages 2,3 & 4)

    The Working Party agreed with the Club's view that, with the existing three
    exits, there was no way that the recommended discharge time of 8 minutes
    could be met. Where they disagreed was that an evacuation time of 11-f
    minutes should be regarded as acceptable. Ifno more exits v/ere to be
    provided, the Working Party AGKEED that a crowd limitation of 11,040
    on the Spion Kop should be imposed.

    The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
    below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommended value of 8ft.
    As this was in fact some 6'6”, the Working Party AGEEED that the Club
    be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
    remove this danger to spectators.

    The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow'
    barriers would need installing.

    The area at the back of the Kop would also require close attention.

    Ifnew exits were to be provided by the Club, itwas AGEEED that at least
    T W O would be required. The most economical way of providing one would
    be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
    the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other would
    require to be a completely new exit.

    The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
    the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
    too much of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
    require careful consideration.

    For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be some
    form of lateral separation. The Working Party AGEEED, and itwas suggested
    that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
    to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
    padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

    As recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the Kop
    could cause problems, and itwas AGEEED that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
    Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
    clear the Kop of ice and snow before a game was played.

    The Building Authority pointed out that information was still required from
    the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

                                      - 3 -
(d)    The West T e rra c e (pages 4&5)

In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the
spectator limit to 7 ,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
Working Party AGEEED that itwould be unreasonable to insist that
gangways or additional exits must be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the
Working Party AGEEED that the barriers would require special attention
in view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

(e)    The North West Corner Eeinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

The Working Party AGEEED there were no real problems here, but the
Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

(f)    The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probably satisfactory(the
construction and width of the ramps being such that they could quite properly
be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
the North Stand were only 640mm wide for much of their length, compared
with the recommended width of 1.1 metres.

Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds.of the spectators used
the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. An ideal would be
to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

As an alternative, the Working Party AGEEED that consideration might be
given to removing a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
exits to ensure more equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
If this would cause difficulties, a barrier In the gangways only below the upper
exits might be considered.

So far as the Wire Mesh barriers under the stand were concerned, the
Working Party AGEEED that these must either be removed or made of a
permanent construction.

(jg)    The West Stand

Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
were acceptable in view of the type of stand; the Fire Service felt that
the means of escape were not adequate as the only means of egress was
by war of too staircases. The Working Party AGEEED that itwas essential
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner was telt
to be the most acceptable.

(h)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far as the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it was the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad ingress/egress, the Working Party AGEEED that two addiUonal
exits would be required. It was suggested that the most economical way
doing this was by means of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.
As the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the maximum 12 r i s e r recommended
 in the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

 Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that p r o v i d e d that the
 necessary increased Fire resistance measures were c a r r i e d out, the stand
 would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they
 anticipated.

 The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
 work of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

 The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
 Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
 the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
 access to the ground. As they left immediately afterwards, the same thing
 occurred at the end of a match. This practice had to be stopped, either by
 banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
 of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

  (h)     General Beauirements

  These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.

       Future Ground Capacity

Ifadditional exits are not provided on the Spion Kbp, this will have the

                                                              REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY

                        This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
     which is attainable.
            It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
     and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
      calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
             Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
      the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
     made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                        The green guide has been used as a basis fofr our cal—
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
      guide.                 Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
      fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)     Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.       It
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.   The
            slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
            for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                   The only questions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
           the exits.
                  Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                          2
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
           area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                        2
           Kop is approximately 3120m       which would provide
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                   Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.    Category A must be able to withstand a
           test load of 6 kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)"
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
           incipient defect which needed attention.   Most of
           those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
           would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
           On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
           long barrier which was weak.       It should be emphasised
           that the general situation was satisfactory compared
           with most grounds.
                  Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                      SHEET   3.


EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




           barriers up to a uniform category A standard.   It
           should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
           the tests and there may have been some deterioration
           due to rusting.      Most of the barriers are made from
           2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
           inches when new.   Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield s
           atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
           to more rusting than others and it is possible that
           there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                     Provided a barrier can withstand 6 kN/m, the
           maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
           guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5 to 2.9m
           for slopes of 30°.   These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
           areas.   Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17
           for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.   The slope of the
           upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
           3.1m.
                     Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
           Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
           viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
           view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
           This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
           ground.
                     We propose that the existing barriers should be
           supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
           drawing 1610/1X.      The green shaded area behind each
           barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
           available for spectators.       This area is 2958m   which
           at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.        It
           should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
           have been admitted to the Kop in the past.
                                                                          SHEET       4.

                      Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
                 end and one at the top.    The total width of
                 these three exits at their narrowest points is 1 2 .5m.          /
                 The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
                 exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
                 width, v/ Thus the theoretical time to discharge
                 16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be 11^ minutes,
                 compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
           I guide.    We do not consider this to be a serious
           | matter.   Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
           I desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
             |   fire, or explosion, or structural failure.      In the
                 case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectator
                 which might create danger.   We believe that for an
                 interim period at least the evacuation time of II 4
               minutes should be acceptable.
             1        The exits at each end of the terrace are
               reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
                 end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                 recommended value of 8 ft.  This defect could be
                 removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
                 it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
                 and the cost of modification is not justified in an
                 existing structure.
                        The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
                 from handrails dividing it into lanes.   Some remodelling
        f'       of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
                 desirable.
     (b)         The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                        The west terrace has a total area of 1480m        but
                 there are no gangways.    We feel that some allowance should
                                                                       SHEET   5.


EASTW O O D & PARTNERS

              be made for circulation space as spectators have
              to move     quite considerable horizontal distances
              to achieve good packing.          The full area would
              justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
              probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
              of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
              The barriers should be designed to match this figure
              approximately.   Those barriers which cannot withstand
              6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
              ones provided where necessary.
                     The extra barriers required to achieve
              approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
              attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                     The three exits have a total width of about
              11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
              to leave the ground. Thus the terrace could be
              emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                         The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
              should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.         There are
              no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
              exit.       But we feel this is of no consequence as
              movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
              and quick.

      (c)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                         This area is also illustrated in the drawing
              1610/2X.   The gross area available (there are no
              gangways) is about 565 m .   Thus if the crush barriers
              were adequate and the whole area is included the number
              of spectators could be about 3,050.
                     Provided the existing crush barriers are
              brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
                                                                    sheet 6 .


EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                        2
           shown in green.    This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.   This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                  The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                   The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard. | The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                  The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended 1-lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                   Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However, it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
           speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                   On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.   Thereafter
           the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
           This established that in an emergency the green guide
           figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l'lm gangway)
           can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                        SHEET   7#


EASTW O O D & PARTNERS




            the average is 556 per exit.      Thus the stand would
            empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
            recommended limit of eight minutes.
                    Our observations in company with the fire
            officerte staff on 6 January showed that everyone
            had left this stand,    apart from some people who were
            in no hurry,    in about six minutes,    although we also
            counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
            whistle.      The overall picture appears very satisfactory
            and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
            as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)     The West Stand
                    This stand is very similar to the north stand
            in its construction.      We were not able to accurately
            assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
            January because there were many seats which were unsold.
            However,     there is every reason to believe that there
            will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
            eight minutes also.      There should be no need for
            significant modifications.

    (c)     The South Stand
                    The structure has been surveyed and appended
            are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
            show the plans and cross-section.        Also attached is
            a seating plan,    drawing No. 1610/6.
                    The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
            has 5710 seats.      These are served by 12 exits (excluding
            those serving the directors box) so that an average
            of 476 people need to pass through each exit.         The
            count by the fire offic e r ’s staff on 6 January showed
            an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
             exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
             seven minutes.     Indeed there were very few people
                                                                    SHEET   8.


EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.     A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                   Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.        Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.        This is equivalent to
           ’l an e s ’ of 550mm.   At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.        To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                   At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air,      through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                   The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.       This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.        Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.


    General Requirements
           The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
    Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
    matters.    Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
                                                                    SHEET

    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
    further visit.    We would like to be present when any
    further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
           If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
    post they would like,    this can be considered by the club
    and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
           A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
           In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
    the various electrical services so that we shall be in a

    Future Ground Capacity
           Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
    ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
           Seating approximately                24,000
           Standing on Spion Kop                16,000
           Standing at Leppings Lane end
           (total including N.W.    corner)     10,100

                                                 50,100

           It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
    has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
    be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
    19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed,   it
    is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
    70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
    Kop probably approached 30,000.
           It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
    excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                                              1, <a




I thank you for your letter dated 22nd December, 1973, and tha copy
letter of the Building Surveyor of tha Sheffield Metropolitan
District Council.

It would seem essential that the officers of the County Council and
Metropolitan District Council involved in ths production of tha
general safety certificate required by the Shaffield Wednesday
Football Club under the above fict, undertake a comprehensive survey
of the ground. I feel sure that it would be beneficial to tha Club
if, initially, each department acted in unison in this respect
rather than separately and I would make the necessary arrangements
with my officers for this to be achieved,

A copy of th9 report of each department should be provided to each
involved department to enable problems to be discussed so that an
accepted approach might be determined and ccn3olidat3d into a single
report which should be forwarded to the Club.

This report, together with that of Dr* Eastwood, would form ths
basis of a further meeting with officials of the Club as differences
of opinion, if any, would have been identified.

It is my opinion that the necessary comprehensive survey could not
be undertaken satisfactorily without plan drawings. In this respect
I refer to paragraph 1.3 of the ’green code*:

"Tha problem of crowd safety at football grounds is complex and
cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of a ground,
such as stair3, passages or S8cti&p3 cf terracing, is satisfactory
in itself. The inter-relation of components is essential: they
should be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit”.

Following the receipt cf drawings I suggest that Officers meet to
agree on identification procedures. In order that each department
is able to identify parts of the ground in a uniform manner, I
would prefer to have stands and terraces clearly idsntifiod, exit
routss, passages, gangways, gateways, doors, etc., numbered in a
consecutive manner-and stairways lettered.
                     3
Officers of the County Council and Metropolitan District Council
have visited the ground and I bslievs that further visits should
be part of thetcomprehensive survey. Findings from visits other


                                                    Cont’d.
than tha survey referred to will be limited and if we involve
ourselves in consultation with the Club following the submission
of Dr. Eastwood's report with limited information this could
prove unfortunate in the long term.

As previously mentioned I prefer to await the provision of ths
plan drawings which have already been requested and if any
action can be taken to expedite this matter it would be
appreciated.

The Working P arty w ere inform ed that the S ecretary of the Sheffield
United Football Club Ltd. had w ritten to the Chief Executive o f the
County Council "enclosing’ farther draw ings obtained through the go*>d
o ffic e s of the C i t y o f Sheffield M etropolitan D is tr ic t Council relalin:;
to the John S treet Stand and ground which are required by you to suppoi
an application for a lic e n c e at this ground under the second designa ion
order". The le tte r concluded by saying that "we shall be grateful
hear from you in due co u rse what p r o g r e s s has been made in rein lion to
our application".

The work which had been undertaken p rior to the Club indicating in
Septem ber, 1976 that they did not w ish to p ro ceed in anticipation of
designation w as review ed .

Whilst the County's A rch itectu ra l and Building S e r v ic e s O fficer had
o rigin ally com m en ced work on the preparation of single line draw ings,
it had proved to be m o re difficult than had been en visaged dir; to the
num erous different s c a le plans supplied at v a rio u s sta g es a s w ell a s
staffing d iffic u lties, and had been nowhere near com pleted by the time
they had been instructed not to take any further action on ihc Club
deciding (in Septem ber, 197 G) not to p ro ceed .

The la te st p lan s supplied appeared to be either the D is tr ic t C ouncil's
o rig in a ls loaned to the Club or co p ie s of them . The sam e pi oblem of
different s c a le s would apply.

The Working P arty felt that the position had b ecom e so confv sed by the
"stop’/go" situation, and staff ch a n g es, that there w as little ultornaf;vc
but to start again from the beginning. T here scorned to be so m e doubt
w hether the Club had been supplied with-the N otes for Guidance of

           Background

1 . vV-   As the Com m ittee will, r e c a ll,, the County. .Council's pow ers and duties under the
          Ac t a re partaP'this*CanSmtttee? s te-rms.o-fre-ferencre^. 0 o 8 th January, 19-76,' the- Comn
          decided that their functions should be e x e r c is e d through O fficer Working P a r ties
          for the four Borough Council a r e a s , co n sistin g of rep resen ta tiv es of the P o lic e ,
          the F ir e S erv ice and the Building Inspectors of the Borough Councils, with
          co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of A dm inistration.

2.        W hilst it is P a r lia m en t's intention that all sports grounds should com e under
          the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the S ecretary of State up to
          recently had been F ir s t D iv isio n grounds and certain international grounds.
          Follow ing rep resentations by the County Council, the Hillsborough Stadium of the
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has now been designated by the S ecretary of
          State on the basis of its q u asi-in tern ation al u s e .

           General Safety C ertificate

3 .1       The O fficer Working P arty has been considering in detail the te r m s and conditions
           which they fe e l should be attached to a General Safety C ertificate.

3 .2      The following recom m endation is submitted for the C om m ittee's consideration:

                   That the draft General Safety C ertificate now attached be
                   approved as the b a s is for the standard cer tific a te to be
                   u sed throughout the County.




           F ee

4..1      . T h is-lea d s on to the question of th e f e e to .be charged to applicants for General
            S a fe ty C ertificates^ The EegtilatiGris*stipul'ate-that*'a lo c a l authority may determ ine
            the f e e s to be charged in r e s p e c t of applications for the is s u e or amendments of
            safety c e r tific a te s , but that such fe e s shall not exceed an a m o u n t com m ensurate
            with the work actually and reason ab ly done. Home Office C ircular No. 130 /7 6
            referrin g to this, e x p r e s s e s the view that lo c a l authorities should, in the norm al
            co u rse,n o t find it n e c e s s a r y to ch arge fe e s rep resenting m ore than 17 m an /d ays'
            work p er c er tific a te.

4..2:.     The./fees-cbarged, by the 'loeal': autho:Ei±tes:-\vfaQ-ha.ve:issu ed C ertificates to date
        range from no charge at all by the Nottinghamshire County Council to an
        average of £4, 000 by the G reater London Council.

4. 3    T h ere would appear to be fiv e options open to the Com m ittee, as follow s:

        (i)     to charge no fee at all                         ,
        (ii)    to charge a purely nom inal fee
        (iii)    to charge a fee which is a purely arbitrary figure ( i.e . not related to
                 any sp e cific number of m a n /d a y s' work)
        (iv)    to charge a fee related to the Home Office estim a te of 17 m an /d ays' work
        (v)     to charge a fee based on the actual number of m a n /d a y s' w ork.

        In the event of the C om m ittee deciding on option (v), the charge for 17 m a n /d ay s'
        w ork (without including any elem en t of c le r ic a l support o r su p erv iso ry staff) has
        been currently costed at £850.                   T his figure would need to be up-dated, of co u rse,
        to take sa la ry in c r e a s e s , e t c . , into account as n e c e s s a r y . In the event of the
        Com m ittee deciding on option (v), the fee could not, of c o u rse, be determ ined
        until all of the work has been com p leted.

4 .4    W hilst the City of Sheffield M etropolitan D istr ic t Council has yet to make a
        d ecisio n as to the b asis of ch a rg e fo r work undertaken by its Building Surveyors,
        it is lik ely that any d ecisio n taken w ill be influenced by w hether the County Council
        m ak es, say, a purely nom inal ch arge or a full e c o n o m i c ch a rg e.

4 .5    The C om m ittee's in stru ction s as to the fee to be charged are requested.

        P o w e r s of Entry and Inspection'

 5 .1    The Act provides that the County Council, the appropriate D is tr ic t Council and
         the Chief Constable are em pow ered to authorise entry of th eir o ffice rs to sports
         stadia for the purpose of m aking in sp ectio n s.

 5 .2    The following recom m endation is submitted for the C om m ittee's consideration:

                  That the Chief E xecutive fo r the tim e being be authorised to
                  issu e form al authorisations to the requisite o ffice rs under the
                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, to enable them to e x e r c is e
                  the powers of entry and inspection specified in the A ct.

                                                                   F. A. MALLETT

REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE                                              FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
                                                                           8TH JANUARY 1976


                SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975


With refe ren ce to my report to this C om m ittee on the 6th N ovem ber, 1975, further
con sid eration has been given to the detailed arrangem ents which it w ill be n e c e s s a r y
to im plem ent once the S ecre ta ry of State has begun to designate sports stadia as
requiring sa fe ty ce r tific a te s under Section 1. of the A ct. D iscu ssio n s have taken
p lace betw een rep resen ta tiv es of the A dm inistration Departm ent, the P o lic e , and
the F ir e S erv ice, when it was agreed thatfbecause of the con sid erab le amount of
lia iso n work which w ill be n e c e s s a r y betw een the resp ectiv e s p e c ia lis t departm ents,
i . e . , P o lic e , F ir e , and Building Insp ectors of D istrict C ouncils, it is d esirab le
that the work of co-ord ination should be undertaken by the Adm inistration
D epartm ent.

F rom initial consultations which have taken p la ce, it would appear that the S ecreta ry of
State, in his fir st designation ord er, w ill not, apart from certain international
grounds, go beyond 1 s t and 2nd D ivision football grounds, and th erefore the only
one with which the County Council w ill be concerned in the fir s t instance w ill be the
Sheffield United ground. P resu m a b ly it is intended, at a la te r date, to designate
the grounds of clubs in low er D iv isio n s, and there would appear to be no reason
why the County Council should not, in due c o u r se , if they think it d esira b le, ask the
S ecre ta ry of State to include other sp orts stadia in subsequent O rd ers.

B ecau se of the County Council's lim ited initial involvem ent, it is s t ill my opinion
that no in c r e a s e in sta ff w ill be required, but this m ust be qualified by the p roviso
that the situation w ill need to be kept under observation, and a further report w ill
be made if it is n e c e s s a r y to r e v is e this opinion a s a resu lt of the designation of
further sports stadia by the S ecre ta ry o f State.

It has b ecom e obvious from initial d is c u s sio n s , that safety c er tific a tes w ill n e c e s s a r ily
be lengthy and com plex docum ents, containing many conditions, and it is accordingly
proposed to s e t up working p a rties of o ffice rs from the A dm inistration Department,
P o lic e , F ire S erv ice, and the D istr ic t Council, in each D istr ic t, to m eet when the
various d iscip lin es concerned have ca rried out their inspections and formulated
th eir recom m endations, in o rd er to se ttle the form of the sa fety certifica te to be
subm itted to C om m ittee.

 The Act p rovides that the County Council have a duty, when an application for a safety
 cer tific a te is rec eiv e d to d eterm ine whether the applicant is a p erso n lik ely to be in
 a p osition to p reven t contraventions of the term s and conditions of the cer tific a te.
 Your o ffice rs a re of the opinion that, certain ly so far a s football grounds are
 concerned, applications should be submitted by the p erso n in beneficial occupation
 of the p r e m is e s concerned.



                                        -    1
A fter a sa fety cer tific a te has been issu ed , it w ill be n e c e s s a r y , from tim e to tim e,
to c a rr y out inspections to ensure that the conditions are being com plied with.
The frequency of th ese inspections w ill obviously have a bearing on the staffing
situation, but it is su g g ested that a detailed check should be made at the end of eaeli
s e a s o n , followed by another about a month b efore the sta r t of the next sea so n
t© en su re that any departures from the requirem ents of the cer tific a te found on the
fo rm er inspection have been rectified . Apart from th is, it is felt that a couple
of m ore gen eral checks during the s e a s o n should be adequate.

The County Council, the appropriate D istrict Council and the Chief Constable are
em powered to authorise en try o f their o ffice rs to sports stadia for the purpose
o f making in sp ection s. A further rep ort on this and on the question of fixing fees
(if any) to b e charged for applications w ill be submitted at a la ter date.

In an em er g en cy situation, where there is a r isk to s p e c ta to r s, the County Council
has the power to apply to a M agistrates' Court for an O rder prohibiting o r restrictin g
the a d m issio n o f sp ecta to rs until step s have been taken to reduce the risk to a
reasonable le v e l. Even with v e r y careful m onitoring of a ll sporting a ctivities
taking p la ce in the County, it w ill not be p o ssib le to p red ict e v e r y potentially
dangerous situation, which m ay b eco m e apparent at short n o t ic e , and too late to
p erm it the making o f an application to the M agistrates to lim it the gate ( e . g . , if
B a rn sley played on a Saturday at L eeds in the F . A . Cup and drew , and the replay
was on the following T uesday). It w ill be n e c e s s a r y , th erefo re, for your o ffice rs
 to exam ine the situation in an endeavour to identify a ll p otentially dangerous
 sp orts grounds, and if n e c e s s a r y , make applications in r e s p e c t o f them a s they are
 identified.

 To s u m m a r is e , th erefo re, the C om m ittee are asked to adopt the following
 recom m en dations: -


 1.     That the work of co-ordination be undertaken by the Administration
        Departm ent.

 2.     That working p a rtie s o f o ffice rs be constituted for each D istrict, as
        outlined in this rep ort.

 3.     That the su g g ested frequency o f inspections be approved.
