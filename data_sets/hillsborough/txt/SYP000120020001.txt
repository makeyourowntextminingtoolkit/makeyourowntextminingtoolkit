           At 8 . 3 0 a m S a t u r d a y      15 April        1989    I   paraded on duty at Mai n Street

           P ol ic e Station,           for t r a n s p o r t a t i o n    to H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball        Gr o u n d

           for duties at the                semi      final.       I was        in Serial       36 my S e r g e a n t         being

           PS    1829 France.

           We were        t r a n sp or te d    to H i l l s b o r o u g h where       we had a briefing and at about


            1 1 . 15am we were d e p l o y e d to Wads 1ey Bri d g e S t a t i o n where we were                                    to

           meet     the    special        train,      w h i c h was due         to arrive at about 2.05pm.                            The

           day was w a rm and sunny,                   and there was a constant                    stream of L i verpool

           s u pport ers        heading a w a y        from the        football        ground      in an effort               to find

           public: houses             that were        open,     as the ones           in the      vicinity        were

            closed.        As time went            on suppo r t e r s       began      to head back          towards           the

           ground,        and most        of    them seemed to be                in p o s s e s s i o n of    cans of beer,

            lager,    etc,.        At this        time   they seemed             boist e r o u s   but    in good humour.

           Just     up the        road from Wads 1ey Bridge S t a t i o n was H a l f o r d s                      Store,           which

           had a large            grass     bank i n g   in front          of    it.     This was        occupied         by a

            large    number        of Liv e r p o o l    fans,        the m a j o r i t y    of w h o m seemed           to    be

           drink i n g a l c oh ol ic          b e v era ges    from c a n s »       A g a i n they were         b o isterous

           but     in good humour,              but    seemed      to be m a k i n g        no attempt       to head

           towards        the     football        ground.

           At about        1 ,50 pm the         special        train a r r i v e d at Wads ley Br i d g e                Station,
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     R363

w here       our duties were              to    carry out          spot     searches and then escort                    them

to the Leppi ngs Lane                 end of the ground.                       These     suppo r t e r s were        decent

family        people and were              not the normal                type    of supp o r t e r s     you would

expect        on a special           football          train.           They were       orde r l y and very well

behaved and e x c h an ge d humourous                        banter        w ith us as we         escorted        them to

the ground.              W i t h our Serial            at    this       time were a g roup of M o u n t e d

officers who we a ss u m e d w ith their ac c e n t were                                 in fact      from Merse y s i d e

We arri v e d at the L e p p i n g s Lane                    t u r n s t i l e s and at this          time     there

were     quite a number              of    peo 1e , who           seemed to be m a i n l y young men

drinking a l c oh ol ic           drinks         from cans,             who were mill i n g about              and

ma k i n g    no effort         to enter the ground.                      We    then took up duties              outside

the Leppings             Lane    turnstiles.                As    the    time    for kick        off a p p r o a c h e d

the volume          of    people      suddenly          i n creased d ra ma ti ca l l y and              it seemed

that the who 1e of L e p p i n g s Lane was                            one mass       of people a t t e m p t i n g        to

enter        the gr o u n d at       the same time.                    The moo d of the y o u n g e r m e n many

of whom seemed more                  than well          the worse           for drink,          then a p p e a r e d to

change        from being         good h u m o u r e d , to being a ngry and a g i t a t e d at the

fact     that      they wer e        going       to miss          the    start    of the game,           an d everyone

seemed to be             pushing      towards          the       turnstiles.           I. can    remember       seeing a

R an g e Rover w i t h          Inspector         Ellis          sat    on the    top using a loud-hailer

trying        to   convince       the      crowd to stop                pushing       but this      had no effect

whatsoever.              At   this    time       I d o n 't kno w          if the match had kic k e d off or

not.         At this      time    the      police horses                tried    to    cordon off        the

turnstiles an d we were                    i n structed to stand                 between them to stop the

crowd pushing             forward.             X can remember              standing at          the side       of PC

3 0 4 4 Donnell,          but    fans were         climbing             under    the stomachs          of the        horses

and    pushing       them out         of the way,                and Jill       and myself were            tota l l y

ineffectual,             as we were            being    pushed a n d shoved,                an d on o c c a s i o n s

found        it d i fficult       to keep our               feet.        I can remember           turn i n g    to see

fans     climbing         over    the wall         into the ground,                   and   I can rememberi

    seeing a male officer                       doing     likewise,          in retrospect             to p r o bably avoid

    being     crushed.           There          seemed     to be a large              number      of fans          present who

    did not have            tickets and were asking a r o u n d for                             spares.           At    this time

    1 felt that we had                    lost    control           of the situation,             but     now      believe

    that a large            crowd a t te nd ed            in a short          space     of t irne, well                the worse

    for    drink,       and far           too    late to enter              the ground          for the kick off,                and

    that    this       ini t i a t e d the        crush at the              gates.

    S u dd en ly we were            inst r u c t e d      to at t e n d      in the gro u n d as the Liverpool

    suppo r t e r s     had invaded              the    pitch.         1 can remember w a l k i n g along a

    w al kw ay    thro u g h the S ou th S t a n d and down onto the                              pitch.           There were

    s upporte rs        all    over,        and     i n itially        I thought        they had been fighting?

    but as       1' a p p r o a c h e d    the W est S t a n d         it was        obvious      that       s o m e t h i n g was

    wrong.        1 could hear              people       scr eaming arid could see them                           clawing at

    the fence.            Male     o f f i c e r s then scaled               the     fence and tried               to assist

    fans    over the top,                 and    it was      obvious         that     there were          people         in there

    who were          badly hurt a n d            possibly worse.                   The fans on the               pitch and          in

    the stand were              being abusive,               some were         o b v i o u s l y drunk,           but    because

    we were       there and           in u ni f o r m seemed to expect m i r a c l e s                       from       us.     I

    was    even struck           by a s c reaming              d is t r a u g h t    fan.       I felt       so    useless.          I

    can    remember assist                 a y ou ng      boy who had a b d ominal                injuries,             or

    ap p e ar ed to have and tried offer what                                comfort        I   could.         I then

    a s s i s t e d w ith m a n y         injure d and         can remember            trying         to as s i s t      in

    reviving          some who were              o bv io u s l y     be y o n d help,       one being a young                  boy,

    and having a son of my own.

    I cannot          express       the     feeli n g s       I had.         I c o u l d n ’t believe what was

    hap p e n i n g    or why       it had h a p p e n e d .           At    this     time      the    pitch was             strewn

    w i t h bodies and            1 can remember                laying a coat            over the         face         of a male

    about 30 years who was                       o b v io u s l y    beyond a n y o n e ' s      help.        Mal e      officers

    an d fans alike             t hen began to              remove       bodies       on m a k e s h i f t     stretchers.

    It a p p e a re d     to me at the              time      that      there was a w o e f u l l y i n a d e q u a te
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       R363

         amount    of first aid e q u i p m e n t , and            X can remember   people      s c reaming

         for oxygen.         I w a l k ed     over   to the    fencing    to assist     as   best   1 could

         and the-*re seemed         to be a pile of o b v i o u s l y dead        people.       The stench

         was    unreal     but   the    o v erriding       smell    seemed to be alcohol)        along with

         everythi ng       else.

         After we had clone all               we   could    I found two of my female          colleagues PC

         3291 S c h o f i e l d and PC 3044 Donne 11 and we joined officers who                       had

         formed a cordon           in the      centre      of the    pitch.   By this    time    I just     felt

         n u m b , but    can remember         remarking      to my friends      that   I would     never

 ^       a l l o w my son near a football               ground.       I can remember     thinking     and

         commenting        on the drun k e n state of many of the young                  fans.      The whole

         thi ng s eemed to happen so quickly.                       I don't   feel we   could have     done

         any more        than was      done    given the      e n o r m i t y of the situation.
