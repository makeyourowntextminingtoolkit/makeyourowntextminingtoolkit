 £              This       is       the       recollection                of    a    terrible             disaster             witnessed             by    myself,

                Police          Constable                2289       Roy    Green,             on    Saturday             15 A p r i l      1989.

                years,          5    months.              Since          being       sworn          in    as    a Constable                of    this       force          I

                have       served             after       my    probationary                   period          as    a Plain          Clothes             Officer

                of    business.                    Since       my    return          to       the       uniform          branch       of       the    service             in

                April          1989,          I have       attended             most          football          matches             involving             Sheffield

                Wednesday                football          team          and    have          been       on    duty       at       2 Football

                informal             place          of    duty       a't f o o t b a l l           matches          is    at       Gate    3    on    the       Spion

                Kop       end       of    the       stadium          which          is    situated             when       facing          the    Spion          Kop       to

                the       right          ofthe           goal       posts.

                I am       used          to       the    feelings          of       the       crowd       and       consider          myself          to    be

                extremely                experienced                in    crowd          control,             and    of       possible          tension

                caused          by       incidents             on    the       field          of    play.           To    accentuate             this       I will

                say       that       on       11    March       1989       a    situation                occurred             on    the    Spion          Kop
involving          Manchester             United           supporters                and    Sheffield             Wednesday

supporters          resulting             in     9    prosecutions                   and    offenders             who       were          served

with    ground          exclusion           orders.                 I was       involved          with          the    arrest,            of     a

certain       person          at    the     time       and          I coordinated                an    enquiry             which          with

the    use    of    Still          Photography                 and    Video          equipment             resulted             in    the

arrest       of    other       offenders.

At    9.45am,       Saturday             15 A p r i l          1989,       together          with          other       officers,                 I

reported          for    duty       at    Hillsborough                 Football             Stadium             for    the       FA       c up

semi    final       between          Liverpool                 and    Nottingham             Forest             Football             Clubs.

The    briefing          for       that     fixture             was    held          in    the    North          Stand          of    the

Ground.           Chief       Superintendent                    Duckenfield                officiated.

At    11.30am,          the    same       date,        I took          up       my    usual       station             on    the

perimeter          track       at    Gate        3    on       the    Spion          Kop    with       Police          Sergeant

Chapman       and       Inspector           Darling             in    command.              Both       these          officers             have

duties       in    the    players           tunnel             and    from       this       time       I had          no    further

contact       with       them.

At    approximately                1E.00       noon        a    small       number          of    Nottingham                Forest

supporters          took       up    positions                 on    the    Spion          Kop    and       stood          in    small

groups.           The    atmosphere              from          these       supporters             was       excellent.

By    1.30pm,       the       same       date,        more          supporters             had    entered             the       Kop       and

were    enjoying          the       atmosphere                 of    the    anticipated                football             match.               I

then,    as       previously             arranged,              obtained             a meal       from          the    West          Yorkshire

Mobile       Canteen          which       was        situated          adjacent             to    the       east       wall          of    the

Gymnasium          behind          the    North        Stand.              The       meal    was       consumed             in       the

Gymnasium.              After       finishing              my       meal    I    returned             to    my    allocated                duty

at    Gate    3    on    the       Spion       Kop     of       the    stadium.              I    immediately                   became

aware    that       the       number        of       supporters             on       the    Spion          Kop    end       of       the

ground       had    increased             and        that       the    atmosphere                was       of    an    electrical                    and

carnival          nature.           Through           the       fencing          I conversed                with       older

Nottingham          Forest          supporters                 regarding             the    teams          recent          Wembley
                                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                                RA 16

described.              From       this    man,          I was       told        that         he    had       attended                at       the

ground       with       no    ticket       and       had       in    fact        purchased               his       ticket             outside

the    turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s         Lane       for     the         sum    of        25       and       that          he    had

expected          to    be    taken       to       the    enclosure              containing               the          Liverpool

supporters             after       entering          the       Nottingham                Forest          enclosure.                       This

information             about       the    ticket          tout        was       immediately                  passed             to       Ground

Control.            I then         returned          to    my       duty       position             and       observed                that          there

was    a    holiday          atmosphere             with       inflatable                trees,          bananas             and          other

toys       being       flaunted-           1*             this       time        was         enjoying             the       atmosphere                   and

saw    no     problems            whatsoever.              In       fact       it       was    a    pleasure                to    be       in       that

location.              To    keep    themselves                amused,           prior         to    the          start          of       the       game,

the    fans       were       knocking          a    beach       ball        along            the    length             of    the          Spion          Kop

and    eventually             it    cleared          the       security             fencing          and          landed          between                the

advertising             hoardings          and       the       goal       post          netting.              I,       contrary                to       the

proper       ways       of    behaviour             for    a    Police           Officer            on    duties             such          as

these,        picked         the    ball       up    and       placed          it       through          my       gate       into          the

Spion       Kop.        An    immediate             cheer       went        up      and       the    game          continued.                       I

will       repeat       that       the    atmosphere                was     of      a    holiday          nature             and          I must

admit       I was       enjoying          the       duty.           T h e — a-n-ly n a g a t i                HmuyfTt             F f                   at

the    fact       that       I had       not       been    issued           with         a    radio       earpiece,                   I    could

not    hear       any       radio    transmissions.                       I sat          on m y      foldable                seat          and

could       hear       garbled       messages             which        to      me       was    indistinguishable.                                   No

problems          of    any       nature       were       felt       from        my      location.                 From          my       position
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                                          R416

appearance           and       was          myself          enjoying       the       friendly             atmosphere.

At    approximately                    1.50pm          the    same       date    a    situation             arose       which          caused

me    some     concern.                     I was       at    my    gate       and    was       approached             by    a    number          of

Liverpool           supporters                who       attempted          to    explain             that       they    were

frightened           because                they       had    been       placed       in    the       wrong       end       of    the

stadium.             I    inspected                their          ticket       stubs       and       was    surprised             to

discover        that          the       tickets             were    for    that       end       of    the       ground.           I then,

by    radio,        contacted                Police          Ground       Control          and       was    informed             that       in    no

way    were     the       Liverpool                supporters             to    be    escorted             to    the    Leppings             Lane

end    of     the    ground             because             the    tickets       sold       for       that       location           were         to

the    lawful        limit.                 I was       instructed             that    an       overspill             area       had      been

allocated           to    these             supporters             due    to    the    problem             on    the    Spion          Kop       in

a    quadrant        area          to       the    left       and       adjacent       to       the       Northern          Stand.           I

looked        towards          this          area       and       saw    that    2    lines          of    police       officers             were

in a t t e n d a n c e        in       this       area,       segregating             the       opposing          supporters.                    All

persons        at    Gate          3    were       told       to    quietly          make       their       w a y to t h i s         area

where       they     would             be    allocated             standing          space.

This     action          or    instruction                   was    repeated          on    at       least       10    o c c a s i o n s to

Liverpool           Supporters                and       from       observations             in       the    area       of    the

overspill           area,          I saw          no    crowd       behaviour          problems.

At    2.15pm        the       same          date       I was       approached          by a          man    whom       I nowknow                 to

be                                             [y e a r s ,       born                     of

Liverpool,           whom          I again             directed          towards       the       overspill             area.           He    was

in a n      excited           state          and       on    leaving       me    traverse             the       lower       terraces

shouting        Liverpool                   chants          and    displaying          a Liverpool                banner.              I took

this     as    not       only          stupid          but    downright          dangerous                and    entered         my       gate

to    apprehand           him.              This       I did       with    the       help       of    Chief       Inspector               Beal

near     to    the       overspill                area       and    after       documentation,                                   |w a s

ejected       from        the          Football             Stadium       under       the       ground          regulations.                I

must     at    this       point             request          the    reader       to    remember             the       incident
                                                                           PAGE   4
                                                                           R416




described.     From this man, I was told that he had attended at the

ground with no ticket and had in fact purchased his ticket outside

the turnstiles in Leppings Lane for the sum of £25 and that he had

expected to be taken to the enclosure containing the Liverpool

supporters after entering the Nottingham Forest enclosure.      This

information about the ticket tout was immediately passed to Ground

Control.     I then returned to my duty position and observed that there

was a holiday atmosphere with inflatable trees, bananas and other

toys being flaunted.     I, at this time was enjoying the atmosphere and

saw no problems whatsoever.     In fact it was a pleasure to be in that

location.    To keep themselves amused, prior to the start of the game,

the fans were knocking a beach ball along the length of the Spion Kop

and eventually it cleared the security fencing and landed between the

advertising hoardings and the goal post netting.     I, contrary to the

proper ways of behaviour for a Police Officer on     duties such as

these, picked the ball up and placed it through my gate into the

Spion Kop.    An immediate cheer went up and the game continued.       I

will repeat that the atmosphere was of a holiday nature and I must

admit I was enjoying the duty.

At 3-00 p m the match started and due to   the roar of thecrowd and to

the fact that I had not been issued with a radio earpiece, I could

not hear any radio transmissions.    I sat on my foldable seat and

could hear garbled messages which to me was indistinguishable.        No

problems of any nature were felt from my location.     From my position
I    could    see       the    Leppings             Lane       end       of       the    ground             and       it    seemed          that

after       Peter       Beardsley             had    narrowly                missed          a    goal       by       glancing          the

crossbar          that       Liverpool             supporters                had       spilled          out       onto          the    playing

area.        Although          I    could          hear    my       radio          transmitting,                      I could          not

understand          any       messages             and    thought,                as    did       the       Nottingham                Forest

supporters,             that       Liverpool             supporters                had       invaded             the       playing

surface.           The       play    was       stopped          and          as    previously                instructed,                when       on

the    preimeter             track,       all       officers             stand          in       view       of    the       crowd       and       face

them.        This       is    to    monitor          the       tension             and       to    attempt             to       see    where

trouble       might          occur.           From       being       a       holiday             atmosphere                on    the    Spion

Kop,    the       supporters             became          angry,          jeering,                swearing             and       booing       to

show    their       descent          at       what       was    taking             place.              On    glancing             towards          the

Leppings          Lane       end    of    the       Stadium,             I    could          see       people          laid       on    the

ground,       people          climbing             the    security                fences          assisted             by       police

officers          and    other       supporters                being          pulled             into       the       seated          area    which

overlooked          the       terraced             standing          area          on    that          end       of    the       ground.           I

immediatley             realised          that       a    serious             situation                had       arisen          and    on

glancing          back       towards          the    Kop       saw       many          police          officers             descending             the

aisles       towards          my    gate.           Due    to       the       noise          of    the       crowd          I had       not

heard       any    instruction                on    my    radio.              The       officers             were          let    onto       the

playing       surface          via       my    gate       and       I was          shortly             joined          by       Chief

Inspector          Beal       who    I thought             had       taken             control          of       the       situation.              He,

having       to    shout,          told       me    that       I must             watch          the    Kop       because             myself,          PC

Groom       and    PC    Holmes          were       the    only          officers                between          the       thousands             of

Nottingham          Forest          supporters             and       the          Liverpool             supporters.                    I,    to

say    the    least,          was    frightened                and       had       a    stupid          thought.                 I was

thinking,          for       Christ       sake       will       someone                please          throw          the       beach       ball

in    the    air    to       relieve          the    aggresive                tension             of    the       Nottingham

supporters          who       were       aggrieved             at    the          match          being       stopped.                 No-one

at    this    time       could       have          been    aware             of    the       terrible             disaster             which
unfolded.              I then       became          aware       that       a    vast       number          of    officers             had

joined       the       Kop    serial       from       what       I believe             were       outside             the       ground

and    I was          very    relieved.              The    atmosphere                was    worsening                and       nearly

erupted          with       persons       rushing          to    the       gates       when       a    Liverpool

supporter             ran    the    full       length       of       the       ground       and       gesticulated

violently             towards       the    Nottingham                Forest          supporters                from       the    goal

mouth.           He    was    chased       back       by a       police          officer          and          apprehended

inside       the       Liverpool          half       of    the       field.           This       apprehension                   relieved

somewhat          the       tension       of    the       Kop    and       again       a    cheer          went       up.        A

further          Liverpool,          fan       what       I would          describe          as       in       his    forties

repeated          the       same    manoeuvre             but    for       some       reason          this       was       laughed

at    by    the       Forest       supporters.

May    I say          that,       time    at    this        stage          timehad         no    meaning             but        I was

surprised             when    a Liverpool             supporter                was    led       past       my    position

obviously             not    injured       but       being       forcibly             ejected          from          the       ground.

This       man    was       the    supporter          I had          earlier          ejected          from          the

Stadium.              Although       concentrating                   on    the       crowd       in    front          of       me,    I

did    see       an    Ambulance          drive       onto       the       playing          surface             and       then

became       aware          that    Liverpool             supporters             were       breaking             up

advertisement                hoardings          at    the       Leppings             Lane    end       of       the       ground

and    were       gradually          moving          towards          the       Spion       Kop.           A    number,          well

over       100,       ran    the    full       length       of       the       playing       surface             and       I    recall

thinking          that       they    were       breaking             the       hoardings          to       use       as    stretchers.

I    informed         a     press    camera-man             to       move       his    expensive                equipment             which

was    placed          behind       the    hoarding             at    my       location.              By       this       time       the

Nottingham            Forest        supporters              had      become more             calm      and           w h e n the       first

of    the    casualties             were       being        carried            off     via the         ramp          they clapped.

The    running            supporters           by    this       time       had       reached          our       location             and    were

obviously             in a    state       of    shock       and       began          kicking          frenziedly                at    the

advertisment                hoardings.              Many    shouted,             "Get       up    there          you       useless
                                                                                                                                           PAGE

bastards,             help,       there's          people          dying          there."            The       breaking          up    of       the

boards       left       pieces          of    w o o d . 2 " -x         1"       and    about        2*    long       all    over       the

area       and    myself          and       another          officer             were       instructed           to    remove          them

because          of    the    situation             and          because          in a l l      probability                they       would

be    used       as    weapons          against             us.        This       we    did     and       hid    them       behind          the

Worth       Stand       at    the       rear       of       the    gardeners                hut.         Once    in    this       area,          the

scene       was       horrendous             with       injured             and       dead     persons          everywhere.

Although          not       ordered          to    help,          I could             not     leave       this       area    and       offered

my    limited          first       aid       experiences.

To    be    quite       honest,             the    period          of       time       behind        that       North       Stand          is    a

blur       which       I want          to    forget          but       I    can       recall        placing          people       in

various          states       of       injury       in       certain             places,        moving          coughing,             shocked

boys       out    of    way,       against          the          Gymnasium             and     around          the    prison          bus.

Heart       massage          and       the    kiss          of    life,          all     to    no    avail,          and    still          the

dead       and    injured          kept       coming.              Supporters                 were       copying       my    action             and

asking       "are       we    doing          it    right".                 I kept        shouting          "5    pushes,          one

breath."              Many    officers             were          behind          that       stand        and    all    were       in       no

contact          with       each       other.           I    remember             seeing        Inspector             Harvey          in    the

same       situation          as       myself,          also       the          St.    J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e        Personnel.

The    panic          and    upset          were    unimaginable                      and     many       experienced             officers

were       in a       state       of    shock.              Someone             whom     I do       not    know       shouted,             "put

the    dead       in    the       Gymnasium."                    Attempts             were     made       to    transport             dead

persons          into       that       hall.        I       recall          a    young        boy    being       carried          by a

supporter             whom    looked          in a          daze.

I    personally             was    kicked          and       punched             whilst        attempting             to    resuscitate

a    person       by    supporters                who       had    a       dead       man     with       them.        I want          to

believe          that       the    violence             offered             to    me    was     only       to    gain       my

attention.              The       situation             became             so    bad    that        I attempted             to

resuscitate             dead       persons          myself             just       to    appease           the    supporters                who

had    carried          them       in.        The       casualty                was    already           dead    but       the    fans
would       not          accept       that       fact           and were             abusive.

By    the       side       of    the       entrance             to        the       Gymnasium          awoman          police          officer

was    tending             to    a    youth          who        was bre at hing                 spasmodically                and awaiting

the    attention                of    ambulancepersonnel.                             I knelt              by    her       side       to       ask

what       he       was    like       and       suddenly             became          aware       that       I was          getting             wet.

We,    all          in    that       location             were       getting          wet.           Some       in    the       stands          above            us

was    urinating                against          a    corrugated                wall       and       this       was    running             over          us

and    the          dead.        Many          words       of    abuse          were       said       by    police          officers             at

the    scene             and,    what          I could          describe             as    a    w a t e r f a l 1,     stopped.

It    is    very          difficult             to    express             my    feelings             and    I feel          very       emotional

at    this          stage       of    this       report          although             I am       normally             quite          lucid       and

factual             about       the       circumstances                   of    described             events.              They       may       or       may

not    be       in       order       as    they       are       only       recollections                   of    something             which             I

want       to       forget.           For       this       I apologise.

I was       aware          that       scuffles             had       broken          out       and    was       glad       to    see       a    cordon

of    police             officers          at    the       east       end       of    the       North       Stand          and       that

Ambulance                and    Fire       Personnel             were          now    in a t t e n d a n c e .

I will          repeat,          time          had    no    meaning             and       even       I was       becoming

emotionally                upset          and    in       fear       of    my       own    safety.              I will          be    honest,                I

did    not          think       I was          going       to    get       away       from       that       location             alive,          such

was    the          panic       and       animosity             of    the       supporters             who       were       transporting,

by    this          time,       dead       bodies           I heard             a    scream          for    a    driver          to    take          a

badly       injured             to    hospital             and       I ran          for    an    ambulance             door.           At       the

door,       Sergeant             Hardy          told       me    to       keep       going       and       that       he    would          drive             the

vehicle.                 This    he       did    and       I then          was       approached             by       someone          who       said

he    was       a    doctor.              He    asked       me       who       was    in       charge.           I was          absolutely

stunned             by    his    remark          in       the    mayhem.              I am       afraid          that       I was          rude          and

told       him,          "anyone          you    can       see."           I then          told       him,       "walking             wounded

were       against             the    wall,          dead       were       behind          the       police          bus    and       people             in

a    prone          position          might          be    breathing."                    The    doctor          apologised                and
                                                                                                                                           PAGE        9
                                                                                                                                           R416

at    this    time       shaking,             sweating                   and    totally           exhausted.              I    c o u l d n ’t

stand    still.              On    my       way       back       to       the    area        where       the       dead       and    dying

were    I saw       a    youth          who       I    recognised                as     a    Special          Cosntable.              He    had

his    shirt       on    but           is    uniform             trousers were                completely ripped                      from       the

waistband          to    the           turn       up.        He       was       in a    state       of       semi    consciousness

and    I must       admit              that       in    a    kind          of    panic.           I grab bed him               by    the    sirt

front    and       lifted              him    into          the          police roomwhere                a   blanket          was    placed

around       him.        Together             with          PC       Hulley,           we    pulled          and    carried          him    to    an

ambulance          and       again          left       him       in       the    care        of    ambulance          personnel.                 All

the    time    I was          screaming                “breathe,                keep        breathing".              Dead       were       still

being    brought             to    the       rear       of       the       stand        but       thank       God    the       carriers

knew    that       they       were          dead       and       although              they       were       shocked          and    irate,       I at

this    stage       felt          as    though          I was             calming           down    and       regaining             some

control       myself.

Problems       arose          with          the       lack       of       space        at    the    entrance          to       the    Gymnasium

door    and    supporters                   tempers          again             got     frayed.           I    can    only       descibe

that    trying          to    get       a    body       on       a       stretcher           with    20       people          carrying          the

stretcher          caused          mayhem          and       again             I felt        fear    for       my    own       safety.           In

my    exhausted          state          it    was       all          I    could        do    but    to       help    carry          the    dead

inside       the    building.                 The       number             of    bodies           inside       was    horrendous                and
although we know that there were a lot of dead, that sight will haunt

me for the rest of m y life.    Interscaped with the carrying of the

dead, first aid was given to the other injured and I gave cigarettes

to deeply affected and shocked supporters and helpers who were sat in

disbelief.     I, by this time was in need of a drink of water and as I

obtained this water which was situated by the side of the prison I

saw that the juvenile contingent of the St. Johns Ambulance Brigade

had been placed inside that bus for their own safety.     I was glad

they were there but to mar this, a dead person,    covered, was directly

by the door.    I felt upset and deeply regretted that the children had

to see this carnage.    Eventually, and at what time God only knows,

the support services gained control and the total panic of the

situation subsided.    I wanted to throw away my uniform and run away.

I was totally exhausted, although I could not stand still.     When the

last of what I would describe as the walking wounded left by

ambulance, I walked down the ramp towards the playing area and wept a

tear of relief that all the crowd had gone home.    It is hard for me to

admit that whilst the disaster was taking place,   I felt fear for myself

and guilt at feeling this fear and to see no crowd was, in some way, a

selfish relief.    I then went into the Gymnasium, not because I wanted

to but to keep busy, possibly helping with identification of someone

but things were in the charge of the major incident group and rather

than pester anyone there, I went outside.    The sight in there was

horrendous.

People, by this time, were asking about persons they had come with

and a table was set up in the North Stand where a long queue had

formed.   This point was manned and we were then told that anyone who

although          we    know       that    there       were       a       lot    of       dead,          that       sight       will          haunt

me    for    the       rest    of    my    life.        Interscaped                   with          the       carrying          of        the

dead,       first       aid    was    given       to    the       other          injured             and       I gave          cigarettes

disbelief.              I,    by    this    time       was       in       need       of    a    drink          of    water          and       as     I

obtained          this       water    which       was       situated             by       the       side       of    the       prison           I

saw    that       the    Juvenile          contingent             of       the       St.       Johns          Ambulance             Brigade

had    been       placed       inside       that       bus       for       their          own       safety.           I was          glad

the    support          services          gained       control             and       the       total          panic       of    the

situation          subsided.              I wanted          to    throw          away          my    uniform          and       run        away.

I was       totally          exhausted,          although             I    could          not       stand          still.           tty

describe          as    the    walking          wounded          left       by       ambulance,                I walked             down        the

relief.           I then       went       into    the       Gymnasium,                not       because             I wanted             to     but

horrendous.

People,       by       this    time,       were       asking          about          persons             they       had       come       with

and    a    table       was    set    up    in    the       North          Stand          where          a    long    queue          had

    had nothing to do was to sit in the North Stand.

    Some kind of de-briefing took place and myself,    together with other

    officers were stood down from the ground and were told to go to

    Niagara Sports Club.     This we did and although I was to be on duty

    from that time and until 11.00 am the following morning I had 2 stiff

    drinks.     Although these drinks relaxed me somewhat,   I sat outside on

    the wall adjacent to the entrance steps and tried to reflect and admit

    just what had happened.     This was impossible so I made a telephone

    message to my daughter to the effect that I wanted her to bring my

    vehicle to Niagara from where I had left it at her boyfriend’s home.

    This she did and on her arrival she enquired as to whether I had

    telephoned home.     I had not and felt again guilty and tearful for not

    doing so.

    Whilst sat there, a Liverpool supporter of about 18 years came up to

    us and asked how to get to Colley Road Catholic School where his

    party had left their transport.     I tried to explain the quickest way

    to walk and finally told my daughter and her boyfriend to take him

    there.    This they did and I sat on my own very quiet and taking stock

    of things.

    During this period I was joined by PC Groome and was spoken to by

    Inspector Sykes and Superintendent Greenway.     I could not face going

    inside the Club because I did not want to hear anything about what

    had happened.     I did after some time and on the return of my

    daughter,    I continued my tour of duty until 1.00 am with PC Groome

    but in all honesty, I cannot recall what duties I performed.

    This is a true and accurate account of what I recall and I sign it so.

This      she       did        and     on her a r r i v a l            she     enquired              as    to    whether             I had

telephoned                home.            I had   not        and       felt        again        guilty          and    tearful               for not

doing       so.

Whilst         sat        there,       a     Liverpool                supporter            of    about          18 y e a r s         came         u p to

party       had       left       their       transport.                    I tried         to    explain             the       quickest                way

to    walk      and        finally          told       my    daughter              and     her       boyfriend             to       take          him

there.          This           they    did    and       I sat          on     my    own      very         quiet       and       taking             stock

of    things .

During         this        period          I was       joined          by    PC     Groome           and    was       spoken             to       by

Inspector             Sykes          and    Superintendent                   Greenway.                I could          not          face          going

inside         the        Club       because       I did          not       want      to    hear          anything             about          what

had    happened.                 I did       after          some       time        and     on    the       return          of       my

daughter,             I    continued          my       tour       of       duty     until        1.00       am       with       PC       Groome

but    in a l l           honestly,          I cannot             recall           what     duties          I performed.

This      is    a     true       and       accurate          account           of     what       I    recall          and       I sign             it    so.

At 9,45am,           Saturday         15'A p r i 1,1989,         t o g ether w ith other            officers,            I

semi     final       betw e e n L i verpool             and N o t t i n g h a m Forest       Football        Clubs.

The    briefing        for      that       fixture was         held      in the N orth S t a n d         of the

Ground.         Chief       Superintendent               Duck e n f i e 3.d officiated.

At    11.3 0 a m , the         same       date,    I took      up my usual           station on the

perimeter         track at Gate 3 on the S p i o n Kop wit h Police                                 Sergeant

C h a p m a n and     Inspector            Darling       in command,,           Both these         officers         have

d uties       in the       players         tunnel       and from this           time    I had no further

contact w i t h        them.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    12.00 noon a small                 number       of N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s u pporters         took      up    positions          on the S p i o n Kop and stood                in small

groups.         The a t m o s p h e r e       from these         s u p p o r t e r s was    excellent.

By    1„30pm,        the    same      date,       more     supporters         had entered         the Kop and

were     enjoying          the a t m o s p h e r e      of the a n t i c i p a t e d    football        match,,          I.

then,     as    p r e v i o u s l y arranged,            o b t a i n e d a meal      from the West Y o rkshire

M o b i l e C a n t e e n w h i c h was         s i t uated a d j a c e n t     to the      east wall        of the

Gymnasium        be h i n d the N orth Stand.                    The meal        was    consumed        in the

Gymnasium.            After         f i n ishing my meal           I returned to my a l l o c a t e d duty

at Gate 3 on the S p i o n Kop of the stadium.                                   I i m m e d i a t e l y became

a ware    that       the    number         of s u pporters         on the Spion Kop end of the

g round had          inc r e a s e d and that            the a t m o s p h e r e was       of an electrical                  and

carnival nature.                    Through       the    fencing        I conversed w ith older

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       1 . 5 0 pm the      same      date a sit u a t i o n arose w h i c h            caused

me some        concern.                I was at my gate and was a p p r o a c h e d                  by a number of

Li v e r p o o l    s u p p o r t e r s who a t t e m p t e d      to e x p l a i n that they were

frightened            beca u s e       they had been             placed    in the wrong           end of the

stadium.              I ins p e c t e d       their       ticket       stubs and was          surprised       to

discover           that      the    tickets were            for    that    and of the ground.                 I then,

by    radio,        co n t a c t e d Pol i c e G r o u n d Control              and was       informed that           in no

way were           the L i v e r p a o l      supporters          to    be escorted         to the L e p p i n g s     Lane

end of the            ground        because the t i c k e t s            sold    for that       location were to

the     lawful        limit.           I was     instr u c t e d that an overspill                 a rea had        been

allocated           to these           supporters          due    to the    problem         on the S p i o n Kop           in

a quadrant            area to the             left and a d j a c e n t      to the N or t h e r n Stand.               I

looked towards                this area and saw that 2                     lines       of   police     officers were

:i.n a t t e n d a n c e     in this area,             segregating         the       opposing supporters.                  Al l

persons at Gate 3 were                        told to q u i e t l y make             their way     to this area

wh e r e    they w o u l d         be a l l o c a t e d    standing       space.

This a c t i o n        or    in s t r u c t i o n was      r e p eated    on at       least    10 occasions           to

Liv e r p o o l     S up p o r t e r s   and from o b s e r v a t i o n s        in the are a of the

overspill           area,      I saw no          crowd b e haviour          problems.

At 2 . 1 5 p m      the same           date    1 was a p p r o a c h e d    by a man who m           1 now know to

be                                 |     [years,          born                  of                                   |'

L i verpool,          whom     I a g a i n d i r ected           towards    the       overspill      area,.        He was

in an exci t e d             state and         on leaving me t r a verse the                   lower   terraces

s h o uting L i v e r p o o l          chants and d i s p l a y i n g       a Liverpool          banner.           I took

this as        not     only        stupid but          d o w nright      d a ngerous and ente r e d my gate

to a p p r e h a n d       him.        This    I did with          the    help of Chief           Inspector Beal

near       to the      overspill           are a and after             documentation,!__________ was

must at       this     point        request      the     reader       to    remember      the    incident

described.           From        this man,           I was    told that       he had a t t e n d e d at the

ground wit h no ticket and had                          in fact       purchased his            ticket    outside

the    turnstiles          in L e p p i n g s Lane           for    the sum of £E5 a n d that he had

expected        to be t aken to the enc l o s u r e                   containing         the Liverpool

supporters after                 entering       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest        enclosure.          This

in f o r m a t i o n a b o u t    the    ticket        tout was       i m m e d iately    passed to G r o u n d

Control.          I then         returned       to my duty           position and o b s e r v e d that           there

was a holiday a t m o s p h e r e w ith                 infl a t a b l e    trees,    bananas      and other

toys    being      flaunted.             I, at        this    time    was    enjoying      the a t m o s p h e r e and

saw no      p r o b l e m s ;w h a t s o e v e r .     In fact       it was a pleasure            to be in that

location.          To k e e p them s e l v e s amused,                prior    to the start          of the      game,

the    fans were          k n o c k i n g a beach ball              along    the   length       of the S p i o n Kop

and    eventually          it     cleared       the     security          fencing and      landed       between the

advertising          hoardings           and the goal              post    netting.       I,    contrary    to the

proper ways          of    b e haviour         f o r a Po l i c e     Offi c e r   on duties       such as

these,      picked        the     ball    up and        placed       it thro u g h my gate         into the

S p i o n Kop.       An    immediate           cheer went           up and    the game         continued.        I

will    repeat       that        the a t m o s p h e r e was        of a holiday nature            and    I must

admit     I was      enjoying           the    duty.         The    only negative         thought       I felt at

this    time was          that      staff      from the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football          Club

were    covering          certain a d v e r t i s e m e n t         hoarding with a blue             plastic and

I remember         thinking,            “the    petty bastards,              thinking      of business        on an

occasion        like      this".         Fans    noti c e d this act and made                   comments    like,

"they sho u l d        have       paid their          bills        if they wa n t e d their        product       on

the    television".

at     this time           could have           been aware         of the^-te r r i bl e disaster which

unfolded,            I then became aware                   thaUe       vast       number    of officers            had

inside the L i v e r p o o l             half      of the      field.        This a p p r e h e n s i o n    relieved

s o m ewhat      the       t e n s i o n of the Kop and a g a i n a                cheer went         up.     A

repeated the               same m a n o e u v r e      but for some           reason this was           laughed

at     by the Fo r e s t         supporters.

Ma y    I say that,              time at this            stage       time had no meaning         but        I was

It is very d i f f i c u l t            to express my feelings               and     I feel     very emotional^

at this         stage      of    this    report a l t h o u g h     I am n o r mally quite             lucid and

not     be    in order          as they are       only      recollections           of something w h i c h           I

want     to forget.              For    this   I apologise.

of    police       o f f i c e r s at    the east      end of the N orth S tand and                    that

A m b u l a n c e and Fire Personnel                 were    now    in attendance.

I will        repeat,       time       had no mean i n g      and    even    I was     becoming

emotionally           upset and          in fear of my own safety.                    I will      be honest,             I

did     not think          I was       going   to get a w a y       from that        location alive,            such

was     the     panic and a n i m o s i t y       of the      s u p p o r t e r s who were       transporting,

b adly       injured       to    hospital      and    I ran for an a m bulance                door.         At the

door,        Sergeant       H a r d y told me        to keep going and that                  he w o u l d drive        the

vehicle.          This      he did an d        I then was          approached        by someone who            said

he was a doctor.                  He a sked me who was              in charge.         I was a b s o l u t e l y

s t u n n e d by his remark              in the mayhem.             I am a f r a i d that        I was       rude and

told him,         "anyone         you    can see."          I then told him,           "walking woun d e d

at     this    time    shaking,           sweating       and t o t a l l y exhausted.               I couldn't

stand        still.     On my way back              to the are a where              the    dead and dying

were     I saw a y o u t h who             I recog n i s e d as a Special              Cosntable.             He    had

his     shirt        on but i;s uniform trousers were                        completely ripped              from the

waistband            to the turn          up,,    He was        in a state      of semi          consc i o u s n e s s

an d    I must a dmit          that        in a kind of          panic.       I grab b e d him by the sirt

front and            lifted him        into      the     police room where a blanket was                     placed

a r ou n d    him.     Together           with PC Hulley,          we     pulled and         carried him to an

the     time    I was       s c r eaming      "breathe,         keep    breathing".              Dead were         still

being        brought    to the        rear       of the    stand       but   thank God the             carriers

knew that        they were           dead and a l t h o u g h      they were          shocked and           irate,        1 at

this     stage       felt as        though       I was    calming       down and       regaining          some

control        myseIf.

          the building.                    The number       of bodies         inside was            h o r r e n d o u s and

      hough we know             that       there were a lot            of    dead,       that      sight will          haunt

me    for the     rest of my               life.     I n t e r s c a p e d w i t h the     carrying          of the

dead,    first a i d was            given to the            other      injured and. I gave                  cigarettes

to d e e p l y a f f e c t e d a n d shocked s up p o r t e r s               and helpers who wre sat                           in

^disbelief.          I,    by this          time was       in need of a drink                of water and as                    1

ob t a i n e d this       water    w h i c h was s i t u a t e d       by the side           of the         prison       I

saw that       the J u v e n i l e         contingent       of the St.            Johns A m b u l a n c e Brigade

had    been    placed        inside         that    bus    for    their      own safety.             I was      glad

they were       there        but    to mar         this,    a dead        person,        covered,        was    directly

by the door.              I felt       upset and deeply              regretted           that- the       children had

to see this          carnage.              Eventually,       and at what            time     god only knows,

the    support       services          gained       control       and the         total    panic       of    the

s i t u a t i o n subsided.            I wanted to t hrow awa y my uniform and                               run away.

I was     totally         exhausted,            although      I could        not     stand      still.         liy

emotional       state        was anger morose               and     1 kept        telling       myself       that      this

had not       happened.            I felt        useless and gu i l t y and               in anger          asked where

the    hell    were       our    senior         officers.         W hen     the    last of what             I would

d e s cribe as the w a l k i n g woun d e d                left    by ambulance,             I walked          down the

ramp    towards       the       playing area and wept a tear                        of    relief       that all          the

crowd had gone             home.           It   is hard for me            to admit        that whilst           the

d i s aster was       taking        place,         I felt    fear      for myself and               guilt at

feeling       this    fear an d to see               no    crowd was,         in some way,             a self i s h

relief,        I then went             into the Gymnasium,                  not    because         I wanted        to but

to keep       busy,       p o s s i b l y helping w i t h         i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of   someone         but

things were          in the        charge of the major                 incident          group and          rather than

pester anyone             there,       I    went   outside.          The     sight       in there was

horrendous.

People,       by this       time,          were asking about              persons        they had        come with

and a table was             set    up in the N o r t h S t a n d where a long                        queue had

formed.     This     point was man n e d and we were                 then told that an y o n e who

had    nothing     to do was          to sit    in the N o r t h Stand.            M a n y offic e r s    sat

there    in b e w i l de r m e n t   and    still    no senior       officer was          present.        It

was an u p l i f t i n g    to see Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mole walk ac r o s s               the

field:of       play.

So m e kind of de~-.br i ef i ng took            place and myself,              together w ith other                .

o f f i cers were s to o d       down      from the     ground and were            told to go to

N i a g a r a Sports    Club.         This we did and a l t h o u g h           I was   to be on duty

from that       time a n d      until      11.00 am the f o l l o w i n g morn i n g          1 had 2 stiff

drinks.        Although        these    drinks      relaxed' me      somewhat,          I sat outside          on

the wall       adjacent- to the entrance                steps and         tried to       reflect and admit

just what       had happened.              This was     i mpossible        so    I made a telephone

message     to my d a u g h t e r      to the effect         that    I wa n t e d her      to    bring my

vehicle     to N i a g a r a    from where        I had     left    it at her       b o yfriends        home.

This    she did and         on her arrival           she    e n q u i r e d as to whet h e r      I had

telephoned       home.         I had not and felt a g a i n guilty and tearful                          for not

doing    so.

Whilst    sat    there,        a Liverpool       s u p porter      of about       18 years       came up to

us and a sked        how to get         to Co l l e y Road C a t holic          School    where     his

party had       left    their        transport.       I tried       to explain the quickest way

to walk and f i n a l l y        told my daughter            and    her    b o yfriend    to take        him

there.      This     they did and           I sat   on my own very quiet                and taking        stock

of things.

During    this     period       I was      joined by PC Groorne and was                 spoken to by

Inspector       Sykes and S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      Greenway.        1 could not          face    going

inside    the C l u b      because      I did not want          to hear a n y t h i n g a bout what

had happened.           I did after          some   time and on the             return of my

daughter,       1 con t i n u e d rny tour       of duty until            1,00 am w i t h PC Groome

but    in all    honestly,           I cannot    recall      what    duties       I performed.

This    is a true and a c c u r a t e account               of what       I recall      and     I sign    it so.

                            THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY. 15 APRIL 1989



        This is the recollections of a terrible disaster witnessed by myself, Police Constable 2289 Roy Green,
        on Saturday 15 April 1989.

        I have been a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Force for 12 years, 5 months. Since
        being sworn in as a Constable of this force I have served after my probationary period as a Plain
        Clothes Officer and as a Detective Constable at Hammerton Road Police Station. I have been involved
        in Violent Death and have on many occasions been the exhibits officer on Murders and have
        witnessed many Post Mortem examinations. Death in all degrees is not a stranger to me in my line of
        business. Since my return to the uniform branch of the service in April 1989, I have attended most
        football matches involving Sheffield Wednesday football team and have been on duty at 2 Football
        Association Cup Semi Finals at Hillsborough Football Stadium. My informal place of duty at football
        matches is at Gate 3 on the Spion Kop end of the stadium which is situated when facing the Spion
        Kop to the right of the goal posts.

        I am used to the feelings of the crowd and consider myself to be extremely experienced in crowd
        control, and of possible tension caused by incidents on the field of play. To accentuate this I will say
        that on 11 March 1989 a situation occurred on the Spion Kop involving Manchester United supporters
        and Sheffield Wednesday supporters resulting in 9 prosecutions and offenders who were served with
        ground exclusion orders. I was involved with the arrest of a certain person at the time and I co­
        ordinated an enquiry which with the use of Still Photography and Video equipment resulted in the
        arrest of other offenders.

        At 9.45 am, Saturday 15 April 1989, together with other officers, I reported for duty at Hillsborough
        Football Stadium for the FA cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest Football Clubs.
        The briefing for that fixture was held in the North Stand of the Ground. Chief Superintendent
        Duckenfield officiated.

        At 11.30 am, the same date, I took up my usual station on the perimeter track at Gate 3 on the Spion
        Kop with Police Sergeant Chapman and Inspector Darling in command. Both these officers have
        duties in the players tunnel and from this time I had no further contact with them.

        At approximately 12.00 noon a small number of Nottingham Forrest supporters took up positions on
        the Spion Kop and stood in small groups. The atmosphere from these supporters was excellent.

         By 1.30 pm, the same date, more supporters had entered the Kop and were enjoying the atmosphere
        of the anticipated football match. I then, as previously arranged, obtained a meal from the West
        Yorkshire Mobile Canteen which was situated adjacent to the east wall of the Gymnasium behind the
        North Stand. The meal was consumed in the Gymnasium. After finishing my meal I returned to my
        allocated duty at Gate 3 on the Spion Kop end of the stadium. I immediately became aware that the
        number of supporters on the Spion Kop end of the ground had increased and that the atmosphere
        was of an electrical and carnival nature. Through the fencing I conversed with older Nottingham
        Forrest supporters regarding the teams recent Wembley appearance and was myself enjoying the
        friendly atmosphere.

        At approximately 1.50 pm the same date a situation arose which caused me some concern. I was at
        my gate and was approached by a number of Liverpool supporters who attempted to explain that they
        were frightened because they had been placed in the wrong end of the stadium. I inspected their
        ticket stubs and was surprised to discover that the tickets were for that end of the ground. I then, by
        radio, contacted Police Ground Control and was informed that in no way were the Liverpool
        supporters to be escorted to the Leppings Lane end of the ground because the tickets sold for that
joined the Kop serial from what I believe were outside the ground and I was very relieved. The
atmosphere was worsening and nearly erupted with persons rushing to the gates when a Liverpool
supporter ran the full length of the ground and gesticulated violently towards the Nottingham Forrest
supporters from the goal mouth. He was chased back by a police officer and apprehended inside the
Liverpool half of the field. This apprehension relieved somewhat the tension of the Kop and again a
cheer went up. A further Liverpool, fan what I would describe as in his forties repeated the same
manoeuvre but for some reason this was laughed at by the Forrest supporters.

May I say that, time at this stage time had no meaning but I was surprised when a Liverpool supporter
was led past my position obviously not injured but being forcibly ejected from the ground. This man
was the supporter I had earlier ejected from the Stadium. Although concentrating on the crowd in
front of me, I did see an Ambulance drive onto the playing surface and then became aware that
Liverpool supporters were breaking up advertisement hoardings at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground and were gradually moving toward the Spion Kop)<A number, well over 100, ran the full length
of the playing surface and I recall thinking that they weretsre&king the hoardings to use as stretchers. I
informed a press camera-man to move his expensive equipment which was placed behind the
hoarding at my location. By this time the Nottingham Forrest supporters had become more calm and
when the first of the casualties were being carried of via the ramp they clapped. The running
supporters by this time had reached our location and were obviously in a state of shock and began
kicking frenziedly at the advertisement hoardings. Many shouted, "get up there you useless bastards,
help, there’s people dying there". The breaking up of the boards left pieces of wood 2" x 1“ and about
2’ long all over the area and myself and another officer were instructed to remove them because of the
situation and because in all probability they would be used as weapons against us. This we did and
hid them behind the North Stand at the rear of the gardeners hut. Once in this area, the scene was
horrendous with injured and dead persons everywhere. Although not ordered to help, I could not
leave this area and offered my limited first aid experiences.

To be quite honest, the period of time behind that North Stand is a blur of which I want to forget but I
can recall placing people in various states of injury in certain places, moving coughing, shocked boys
out of the way, against the Gymnasium and around the prison bus. Heart massage and the kiss of life,
all to no avail, and still the dead and injured kept coming. Supporters were copying my action and
asking, “are we doing it right?". I kept shouting “5 pushes, one breath". Many officers were behind that
stand and all were in no contact with each other. I remember seeing Inspector Harvey in the same
situation as myself, also the St John's Ambulance Personnel. The panic and upset were unimaginable
and many experienced officers were in a state of shock. Someone whom I do not know shouted, “put
the dead in the Gymnasium". Attempts were made to transport dead persons into that hall. I recall a
young boy being carried by a supporter whom looked in a daze.

I personally was kicked and punched whilst ,attempting to resuscitate a person by supporters who had
a dead man with them. I want to believe that the violence offered to me was only to gain my attention.
The situation became so bad that I attempted to resuscitate dead persons myself just to appease the
supporters who had carried them in. The casualty was already dead but the fans would not accept
that fact and were abusive.

By the side of the entrance to the Gymnasium, a woman police officer was tending to a youth who was
breathing spasmodically and awaiting the attention of ambulance personnel. I knelt by her side to ask
what he was like and suddenly became aware that I was getting wet. We, all in that location were
getting wet. Someone in the stands above us was urinating against a corrugated wall and this was
running over us and the dead. Many words of abuse were said by police officers at the scene and,
what I could describe as a waterfall, stopped.

It is very difficult to express my feelings and I feel very emotional at this stage of this report although I
am normally quite lucid and factual about the circumstances of described events. They may or may
not be in order as they are only my recollections of something which I want to forget. For this I
apologise.

I was aware that scuffles had broken out and was glad to see a cordon of officers at the east end of
the North Stand and that Ambulance and Fire Personnel were now in attendance.
I will repeat, time had no meaning and even I was becoming emotionally upset and in fear of my own
safety. I will be honest, I did not think I was going to get away from that location alive, such was the
panic and animosity of the supporters who were transporting, by this time, dead bodies.         I heard a
scream for a driver to take a badly injured to hospital and I ran for an ambulance door. At the door,
Sergeant Hardy told me to keep going and that he would drive the vehicle. This he did and I then was
approached by someone who said he was a doctor. He asked me who was in charge. I was
absolutely stunned by his remark in the mahem. I am afraid that I was rude and told him, “anyone you
can see". I then told him, "walking wounded were against the wall, dead were behind the police bus
and people in a prone position might be breathing. The doctor apologised and immediately set to his
task.




                                                                                                I was at
this time shaking, sweating and totally exhausted. I couldn’t stand still. On my way back to the area
where the dead and dying were I saw a youth who I recognised as a Special Constable. He had his
shirt on but his uniform trousers were completely ripped from the waistband to the turn-up. He was in
a state of semi consciousness and I must admit that in a kind of panic, I grabbed him by the shirt front
a lifted him into the police room where a blanket was placed around him. Together with PC Hulley, we
pulled and carried him to an ambulance and again left him in the care of ambulance personnel. All the
time I was screaming, "breathe, keep breathing". Dead were still being brought to the rear of the stand
but thank god the carriers knew that they were dead and although they were shocked and irate, I at
this stage felt as though I was calming down and regaining some control of myself.

 Problems arose with the lack of space at the entrance to the Gymnasium door and supporters
tempers again got frayed. I can only describe that trying to get a body on a stretcher with 20 people
 carrying the stretcher caused mayhem and again I felt fear for my own safety. In my exhausted state it
was all I could do but to help carry the dead inside the building. The number of bodies inside was
horrendous and although we know that there were a lot of dead, that sight will haunt me for the rest of
my life. Interscaped with the carrying of the dead, first aid was given to the other injured and I gave
cigarettes to deeply affected and shocked supporters and helpers who were sat in disbelief. I, by this
time was in need of a drink of water and as I obtained this water which was situated by the side of the
prison I saw that the Juvenile contingent of the St Johns Ambulance Brigade had been placed inside
that bus for their own safety. I was glad they were there but to mar this, a dead person, covered, was
directly by the door. I felt upset and deeply regretted that the children had to see this carnage.
Eventually, and at what time god only knows, the support services gained control and the total panic
of the situation subsided. I wanted to throw away my uniform and run away. I was totally exhausted,
although I could not stand still. My emotional state was anger morose and I kept telling myself that
this had not happened.' I felt useless and guilty and in anger asked where the hell were our senior
officers. When the last of what I would describe as the walking wounded left by ambulance, I walked
down the ramp towards the playing area and wept a tear of relief that all the crowd had gone home. It
is hard for me to admit that whilst the disaster was taking place, I felt fear for myself and guilt at feeling
this fear and to see no crowd was, in some way, a selfish relief. I then went into the Gymnasium, not
because I wanted to but to keep busy, possibly helping with identification of someone but things were
in the charge of the major incident group and rather than pester anyone there, I went outside. The
sight in there was horrendous.

People, by this time, were asking about persons they had come with and a table was set up in the
North Stand where a long queue had formed. This point was manned and we were then told that
anyone who had nothing to do was to sit in the North Stand. Many officers sat there in bewilderment
and still no senior officer was present. It was an uplifting to see Chief Superintendent Mole walk
across the field of play.                                 .

Some kind of de-briefing took place and myself, together with other officers were stood down from the
ground and were told to go to Niagara Sports Club. This we did and although I was to be on duty
from that time and until 11.00 am the following morning I had 2 stiff drinks. Although these drinks
relaxed me somewhat, I sat outside on the wall adjacent to the entrance steps and tried to reflect and
admit just what had happened. This was impossible so I made a telephone message to my daughter
to the effect that I wanted her to bring my vehicle to Niagara from where I had left it at her boyfriends
home. This she did and on her arrival she enquired as to whether I had telephoned home. I had not
and felt again guilty and tearful for not doing so.

Whilst sat there, a Liverpool supporter of about 18 years came up to us and asked how to get to
Colley Road Catholic School where his party had left their transport. I tried to explain the quickest way
to walk and finally told my daughter and her boyfriend to take him there. This they did and I sat on my
own very quiet taking stock of things.

During this period I was joined by PC Groome and was spoken to by Inspector Sykes and
Superintendent Greenway. I could not face going inside the Club because I did not want to hear
anything about what had happened. I did after some time and on the return of my daughter, I
continued my tour of duty until 1.00 am with PC Groome but in all honesty, I cannot recall what duties
I performed.




This is a true and accurate account of what I recall and I sign it so.
