        SUBMISSION OF H.E. WRIGHT, QFSH,MXFireE,FBIM, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, SOUTH
        YORKSHIRES COUNTY FIRE SERVICE, TO THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO T^tb
        DISASTER ai TBS HIXXSBOROUGH STADITO., SHEFFIELD, ON 15TH aP^TT. iqbq




        1.       Introduction



                 I feel sure that all the members of the safety of                     Sports     Grounds

                Working Party, including myself, never believed that the disaster

                 at the     Hillsborough       Stadium,         Sheffield,    could       ever    occur.

                However,     it did,        and having given positive thought as to why it

                happened and what steps might be taken to obviate the                      possibility

                of     repetition      at     any       stadium,       I     submit      the   following

                recommendations for consideration.                 In making these I am conscious

                of    the need to put forward practical suggestions capable of being

                implemented quickly and relatively easily.



        2.       Recommendations



        2.1      Incrress

                To prevent any unduly large crowd                 from being      kept    waiting    for

                admission    and    at the same time minimising the consequent dangers

                of crushing and illegal entry:-



        2.1.1    Separate turnstiles should beprovided to                  permitaccess          to each

                stand, terrace and pen within the stadium.



        2.1.2    The turnstilesproviding            the         accessmentioned        in2-1.1     above

                should be in. sufficient number to be                 capable     of   admitting

                capacity    calculated using Chapter                 16 of the Guide to Safety at

                Sports Grounds in not more than 1 hour, using the notional rate of

                750 persons/turnstile/hour.

                                                    -   1   -
10 07    89   15:03         0 0 7 4 2 726S94                  SOUTH YORKS FIRE                                       121004 010




        2.1.3 Where          there       are    insufficient turnstiles to satisfy 2.1.2 above,
                 either:

                  (i)       additional turnstiles must be provided, or



                 (ii)       the capacity        of   each         stand,     terrace     or   pen     should be

                            restricted to         the        number       of spectators that the existing

                            turnstiles will admit using the notional rate                          mentioned    in

                            2.1.2 above.



        2*1*4   Chapter         5   of    the    Guide       to        Safety at Sports Grounds should be

                amended to satisfy the above and cross referenced to Chapter 16.



                In effect the capacity of each stand, terrace and pen will be the

                lowest figure produced based on exit capacity, standing or seating

                area and the capacity of the turnstiles.



                The factor which determines the capacity should be recorded on the

                General safety Certificate for each stand, terrace anri pen.



        2.2     Control of Numbers



                There        has    never been a legal stipulation in the Safety of Sports

                Grounds Act 1975, that required the capacity of                             individual    parts

                of      a      sports      ground to          be       specified    in   a General       Safety

                Certificate.



                Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,                             which    did     set

                out     matters       which      had to           be included, was replaced by Section

                19(2)(a) of the Fire Safety and Safety of                          Places     of    Sport Act,

                1987, with effect from 1st January, 198S.

                                                         -    2    -

                    The present position is that the Secretary of State now has power

                    to    issue   Regulations      detailing the       matters   to   be    covered#

                    including     capacities,      but   has   not yet done so, therefore each

                    authority is free to         apply whatever       conditions   it wishes      to,

                    therefore



          2.2.1    The    Secretary of State should urgently raaJce Regulations regarding

                   the terms and conditions as may be included in the General                   safety

                   Certificate.        This     should include a requirement for the capacity

                   of each stand, terrace and pen to be specified.



          2.3      Perimeter Pences



                   Planned means designed to allow for the quick release                   of   crowd

                   pressure need to be clearly specified in guidance to authorities.



                   Chapter IS, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

                   provides guidance on the width but           not    the   frequency     at which

                   gates should be provided in perimeter fences.



                   The    provision of perimeter fences goes against all professional

                   training of Fire Service Officers and it is hoped               that    a better

                   solution might be found.



          2*3*1    Perimeter      fences      should only be required where it can be shown

                   that they are absolutely necessary and the continuing provision of

                   all existing fences should be reviewed in this light.




                                                     - 3 -
10 07    39   15:04     0 0 7 4 2 726894              SOUTH YORKS FIRE                            i]006010



        2.3.2    An    accepted professional body should be requested as a matter of

                 urgency to produce a standard specification for a perimeter               fence

                 for use     at    sports grounds.      I recommend that this specification

                provide for sections to be quicJcly and          easily   removed    from the

                perimeter fcracJc side by authorised personnel in an emergency.



                When     available,        this standard should be satisfied at all grounds

                where perimeter fences are considered necessary.



        2.3.3   where perimeter fences are required then gates, not less                     1.1

                metre in width, must be provided to allow spectators to be quickly

                evacuated onto         the pitch perimeter.        Such   gates   should     be

                sufficient      in number to provide for the evacuation of each area

                within 3 minutes, with a minimum provision for each area of 2 such

                gates.     Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports

                Grounds should be amended accordingly.



        2.3.4   A level stepping arrangement should be provided through gates                to

                avoid tripping hazards and wherever possible such gates should be

                in line with radial gangways.          Gate-release fastenings      should   be

                capable    of     easy and immediate release from the pitch side only,

                especially under crowd pressure.



        2.4     stewards



                It is vital that the number of stewards on duty are sufficient               in

                number, adequately trained and effective in their duties.



        2.4.1   I recommend that in broad terms a syllabus to enable satisfactory

                training for stewards, together with           examination   standards     with

                regard to their duties, be established on a national basis.

                                                   - 4 -
10-07 '89   15:06      0 0 7 4 2 726894               SOUTH YORKS FIRE                              @007 010




      2.4.2    3lhe Police should be 'the examining authority for stewards and the

               passing of the examination will enable those so                  qualified to be

               employed if so capable as stewards at sports grounds *



      2.4.3   The    standard of          examination should reflect the responsibilities

              and duties of each, steward.



      2.4.4 A Chief        Steward        should be    appointed to      take    charge    of   all

              stewards.



      2.4.5   Senior stewards should be appointed to take charge of the stewards

              in a defined area of the ground.



     2.4.6    All stewards should be readily identifiable when                              ^hejjr

              duties     and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

              each separately numbered to enable each steward to                  be   identified

              from a distance.



     2.5      Coamuni cation



     2.5,1    The use of the public address system to provide advice to stewards

              and Police should be fully realised, especially when                 noise    seems

              to    apparently     reduce     the     overall effectiveness       of   h«n<1 held

              radios.     Training in the use of this equipment should be provided

              for   those who        use the equipment to instigate messages anri those

              who are expected to react to them.

        2.5. 2    Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium                         for

                 whatever     reason, I suggest that each emergency service be alerted

                 even if fcheix attendance may not be required at that                    time.        This

                 will provide         a pre—warning' during which basic requirements as to

                 the correct address to which a response may                     be    needed     can   be

                 satisfied, together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.



                 Should     the     situation develop to the point of needing a response

                 from another or all emergency services a much briefer                      call will
                 ensure this.



             J I understand that the             Police have made recommendations to the

                 Inquiry which suggest eitheri-



                  (i)   A senior officer of each of the               emergency       services    be    in

                        attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



                 (ii)   the    Police control        box      at the stadium is provided with a

                        Private wire       connection to          the    Control      room of       each

                        emergency service.



                 My   opinions      regarding these          suggestions are not supportive.             I

                 understand that at Hillsborough on 15th April the                    Police     in the

                 control box were not aware of the difficulties that existed on the

                 West Terrace,       should this be so then I would assume that                  a Fire

                 Service Officer        would have equal           difficulty but even when the

                 problem was identified he would              be of     little    use    without       the

                 manpower     and    equipment   that        he would undoubtedly request.             The

                 advantage would, therefore seem to              be     related    to    knowing       the
                 abilities of the Service.

                 hopefully, the extremely infrequent                 occasions when          it will       be

                 required      would, seem to be                an over—provision         which    could be

                 achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



                 I also understand that the Police were in communication with their

                own. main       control      room   at Police Headquarters which already has

                private     wire      connection to             each of    the     emergency      services.

                Private wi_re connections from each of the stadiums provided with a

                safety certificate, or likely to require such in                      the       future,    to

                each of        the    emergency     services        control rooms would also be an

                extremely expensive way of providing good information to the other

                Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.



        2.6     liaison



        2.6.1   Regular liaison between all those responsible for implementing the

                requirements         of    the   Safety of Sports           Grounds       Act     and     the

                respective       clubs       should         take place      to     provide      a greater

                understanding of the problems being met.



        2.6.2   The arrangements proposed by the                  Club    and Police,       where       these

                differ    from       those   specified          in the General Safety Certificate,

                should be considered by the appropriate                    local    authority working

                Party     to     ensure      that   these will            not    affect    other    safety
                precaut ions.

          2.7      Other Matters



          2*7.1    The club managements of each ground             requiring a       General   Safety

                   Certificate      should be    required to        audit the safety provisions

                   within their ground considering the different uses to                which    they

                   are put.       A full written report should be presented to the local

                   authority for consideration.       The full satisfaction of the              Guide

                   to Safety at Sports Grounds should be used for such audit.



                   Any   proposed changes to the ground which would affect any part of

                   the safety precautions should be accompanied by               a    safety    audit

                   report      identifying the    effects     of    the proposals and the steps

                   proposed to compensate for them.         The proposals        and the       report

                   should be      submitted to the local authority for consideration and

                   approval under the safety of Sports Grounds Act prior to any other

                   submission for approval.



         2.7.2     In order to undertaJse such duties effectively it must be realised

                   that manpower resources are needed and this should be catered                 for

                   in    the     departments     of   local        authorities       holding    such
                   responsibilities.
