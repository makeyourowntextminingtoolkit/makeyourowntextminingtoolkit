                THIRTIETH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                WEDNESDAY, 28th JUNE, 11989

                     (MORNING SESSION)


                    DAVID BOWSES   Recalled

           Cross-examined by MR. MAXWELL (Cont'd):

Q. Mr. Bownes, I was dealing with barrier 144 and perhaps
   at this stage you could formally produce - it has already
   gone before Lord Justice Taylor - the photographs showing
   Leppings Lane terraces in 1965 and by reference to those
   as they were refurbished, I think, in 1966 you can see
   barrier 144 across the tunnel entrance.  So far as that
   barrier is concerned and the events of summer of 1986,
   August, if it had been said at any time that the removal
   of 144 would affect capacity on the terraces is that a
   matter which would have been of concern to you?- A. Yes,
   sir, it would.
                                                         \
Q. And is there any action that you would have taken about
   it had that been the position? - A. Yes, sir.  I would
   have asked the appropriate experts for their advice on
   capacity.

Q. In that context who are the appropriate experts? - A.
   The Fire Service, the building surveyor and the Police
   have some involvement, sir.

Q. If such a suggestion had been made is it a matter that
   you think you would have remembered? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Are there any documents on your files or any of the
   other files of the various parties that suggest that
   this was stated? - A. Not so far as I am aware, sir.

Q. At the meeting in August, 1986, who else was there apart
   from Mr. Calvert for the Police? - A. There was, I believe,
   Mr. Strange from Eastwood & Partners, Mr. Butler from the
   Council's building surveyors ....

Q. He is the Council building surveyor? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did he express any view about the removal of 144? - A.
   Other than agreeing to it, sir, I cannot recall.

Q. You recall that he agreed to it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Subsequently was any report ever made to you by way of a
   complaint or comment about the absence of 144 after it
   had been removed?- A. No.

Q. Did anyone ever suggest to you the removal of 144 reduced
ft!
                                      2


                                                          D.   BOWNES


           the power of control of the crowd on the terrace? - A. No.

      Q. I mean in respect of crowd movement or crowd distribution.
         Was anything ever said? - A. No, sir.

      Q. In that context, looking at the matter generally, did
         anyone ever suggest to you that there was any problem
         at all of crowd control on the terrace? - A. No, sir.

      Q. If a report had been made to you about overcrowding on
         the terrace is there any action that you would taken? - A.
         Yes, sir.  I would have immediately consulted once again
         the appropriate experts in that area.

      Q. And, similarly, if it had been suggested to you that there
         was a need to monitor the numbers in some way, counting
         the fans in or counting them when they were on the
         terrace, if that had been suggested to you is that
         something you would have taken action about? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you know that there was
           a means of counting the numbers through the turnstiles
           as a whole? - A. Yes, sir,  I was aware that the turnstiles
           do record numbers of people going through them if that
           was the question.

      Q. And what did you think the object of that was? - A. To
         control the numbers of people on the areas for which
         you had access by the turnstiles.

      Q. But nobody ever raised at all in discussion at any of
         these meetings you attended the problem of subdividing
         the area? - A. Not as far as I recall, sir, no.

      Q.        MR. MIAXWELL:  In that context Lord Justice Taylor
           has seen a plan prepared by Dr. Eastwood's firm of
           April, 1987, showing pens 3 and 4 with two figures on,
           1,000 and 1,200 respectively.   The plan is 8945/1. - A.
           Yes, sir.

      Q. Did such a plan ever come to your notice before this
         tragedy? - A. No.

      Q. Were you aware before this tragedy of such subdivided
         capacities? - A. No, sir.

      Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You mean you were aware of
           the subdivisions but not of the subdivided capacities?
           - A. Yes, sir, that is correct.

      Q.        MR. MAXWELLS   If it had been necessary for any
           person, including the Local Authority, to calculate the
           capacity for a subdivided area is that something that
                            3



                                                   D.   BOWNES


     you would have expected to find mentioned expressly in
     the Green Guide? - A. I believe I would, sir, yes.

Q. Do you find it mentioned expressly in the Green Guide?
   - A. I have not been able to find a reference, sir, no.

Q. And, similarly, is it a matter that you would have expected
   to be mentioned by the Home Office in the advice that they
   have sent out to local authorities? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And is it something that has been mentioned by the Home
   Office? - A. Not as far as I am aware, sir, no.

Q. Or dealt with by virtue of any safety regulations? - A.
   There have definitely been no safety regulations in this
   area, sir.

Q. It seems that in the past doubts have been expressed, I
   think by the Police in documents Lord Justice Taylor has
   seen and also by the club in other such documents, doubts
   expressed about the holding capacity on the Leppings Lane
   terraces.  Were you ever made aware of any such doubts?
   - A. No, sir.

Q. So far as the crush barriers are concerned, quite apart
   from any inspection that Dr. Eastwood's firm makes of
   them, are they also inspected by the Local Authority?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And is that pursuant to the statutory guidance? - A. It
   is, sir.

Q. And is the position this, that at least 10 per cent of
   the crush barriers are inspected for overt signs of
   d a m a g e ? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. So far as first aid is concerned you told Lord Justice
   Taylor that there is not any national index of the kind
   of equipment that should be available by way of first aid
   equipment.   Have you in fact made efforts to see whether
   such a national index is available?- A. Yes, sir.   In
   connection with the pop concert at Sheffield United, for
   example, I obtained a copy of the Greater London Council
   guidance on the sort of matter a local authority ought
   to consider.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The sort of what?- A. Matters
     the local authority ought to consider and there is in there
     a vague reference to first aid.  It is not in any detail
     at all, sir.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   There is no detailed list of equipment
     that you should provide? - A. No, sir, definitely not.

Q. I wonder if I could ask you quite briefly to return to the
                            4


                                                      D,   BOWNES


     memorandum that you have prepared that deals with delay
     and which is now added to your statement only to do this,
     if you would, please.  I think you have actually considered
     the length of time that these different items of exceptional
     workload, as you have described them, have taken for each
     of the six month blocks that are referred to. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Gould you please look at that memorandum and taking the
   blocks of time from January, 1987, could you tell Lord
   Justice Taylor what the exceptional workload amounted to
   first of all for that period, January to June, 1987, the
   total time taken up on these other matters was what? - A.
   Approximately ten working weeks, sir.

Q. And July, 1987, to December, 1981] again the total period?
   - A. Approximately twelve working weeks, sir.

Q. January to June, 1988?- A. Approximately ten working weeks,
   sir.

Q. And finally July to December, 1988? - A. That was approx­
   imately 15 working weeks, sir.,

Q. And I think you can give a breakdown if necessary of those
   total periods?- A. Yes, sir.

Q. I would invite you now, Mr. Bownes, to look to the future.
   Are you aware at least through this Inquiry and probably
   aware in any event of the assistance that the ambulance
   service can give you in respect of your certificating
   function? - A. Yes, sir.  I believe the ambulance service
   can have a useful input and I am sure they will be
   shortly invited to make comments to the Council.

Q. You will extend the invitation to them to be of assistance
   to you?- A. I will do, sir, yes.

Q. Both with regard to medieal and paramedical matters and
   all those other issues on which they can quite clearly
   offer assistance to you?- A. Yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What, as part of your advisory
     group or simply on an ad hoc basis?— A. That would be a
     matter for discussion, sir.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   Similarly, the Health and Safety
     Executive, would you intend to approach them again to
     see whether they could offer assistance? - A. I think
     I would approach them again, sir, to see if they have
     changed their view at all.

                 A.         Not at all, no.

            Q.   And it wa s not              restricted            to   all-ticket         matches?           A.    No,

                                                           C. CALVERT


          Q-      MR. GOLDSACK:     Is it only Category A you would
               understand as a bigger game? - A. No.  We in fact gave
               plusages and minuses, so you would get a B+, which was a
               fairly major game.

          Q. What did you actually tell the stewards in August 1981 that
             they should be doing so far as the terraces were concerned? -
             A. That they basically had a responsibility to ensure that
             people went on to the terraces and the entrances were kept
             clear. I would have never expected then on the terraces,
             particularly at the Leppings Lane end, to go in, where there
             were no gangways, to go in and try and push people around, but
             certainly keeping the entrances clear so people could get in.

          Q.      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Keep entrances clear and do
               something else, you said? - A. Basically keep the entrances
               clear so people could get in through the entrances.

          Q. Yes, but not to go on the terrace? - A. No, I certainly would
             not have expected that.

          Q.       MR. GOLDSACK:   Can you now recall whether there was any
               senior club official present at the meeting in August 1981? -
               A. No, I am sorry, I can't.

          Q. I d o n ’t know whether you were here when Mr. Thorpe gave his
             evidence? - A . I w a s , y e s .

          Q. That your message rather went over everyone's heads
             because there were no stewards with responsibility for
             the West terrace? - A. Having heard his comments I
             accept that n o w , y e s .

          Q.   Do we take it that was not something you were conscious of at
               the time? - A. I was not.  At that time, although I had been
               doing the job for two years, my job developed as Sheffield
               Wednesday came out of the Third Division into the Second
               Division and then into the First Division, and there were more
               pressures.  That is how we developed.  When I first took over
               it was fairly low key because of the games being fairly low
               key.

          Q. As a result of your meeting in August 1981 were you conscious
             of any improvement? - A. I think the improvement came about on
             the terraces because of the physical alteration with the
             barriers.

          Q. I think it is right that in the early 1980s there were not
             many full houses? - A. Until Sheffield Wednesday got into the
             Second Division, very few.  Even in the Third Division when
             they were promoted I think there were probably only 25,000
             there, but after that it went up considerably.

          Q. Can we just look at one more document concerning 1981 before
             moving forward.    Page 153, please.  This is the minutes of an
             officer working party that you don't appear to have been
             present a t , but would you have seen those minutes? - A . I
                              14

                                                   C. CALVERT


     don't think I did.  As I say, it was a system that they were
     dealt with by Headquarters, and they kept the minutes.*

Q. Do you not think it would have been helpful if you as liaison
   officer automatically received a copy? - A. I think it would
   have been helpful if we had had our own file of them.

Q. The last item on page 153:  "The new gates at the rear of the
   terrace also being under Police control".   These are the gates
   at the rear of the radial fences? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you aware that the requirement was that they should be
   under Police control? - A. Not in the meaning of having
   someone physically present at every match.  We operated a
   system where the gates were closed for any reason, for
   segregation, or just to reduce the number of pens in use, a
   Police Officer would be present behind the gates to open and
   shut them.  They were not locked.  If the pens were all given
   over to one set of supports, or two pens were given over to
   one block of supporters, that is to say the south and central,
   the gates would be locked open and left open without a Police
   Officer present.  We understood control to have the ability to
   control them, not to have someone there.

Q. Can you say from where or on what your understanding was
   based? - A . Probably on discussion with M r . Chapman, who was
   the Superintendent at that time and who was present.     He is
   the first name on the list.

Q.   And did the system in practice operate in the way you have
     just said you understood it? - A. It did and still does.

Q. Can we move, please, to page 204.  We are now coming to the
   changes in 1985.  This is a letter that goes out under the
   name of Mr. Moseley, who I think was then the Chief
   Superintendent F Division? - A. That is correct.

Q. Had you given your thoughts to the possible means at that end
   of the ground? - A. I probably instigated this because of the
   problems with segregation in the enclosure at the rear of the
   West Stand at that time.   We approached the club and
   effectively said, "Until you sort it out you are not having
   home supporters at the Leppings Lane end", and they didn't
   have them there.  I drew up a plan of my suggestions for that
   end of the ground which was submitted to the club, I believe
   with this letter, but I am not sure if it was not passed to
   the club by hand, showing what we thought would be the ideal
   configuration at that end of the ground?

Q.   This was a sketch you passed   in? - A. It was asketch   I
     prepared.

Q. We don't seem to have been able to find it? - A. No, I have
   looked in my files when I was down there, and it is not
   present.  It was just a fairly rough sketch.

Q. But what was your proposal? - A. It was fairly radical.        It
                               15


                                                    C. CALVERT


     would have meant knocking all the turnstiles down, starting
     afresh with turnstiles parallel to the back of the West Stand,
     letting into each of the enclosures and each part of the West
     Stand individually, with separate facilities for each
     individual enclosure on the terraces, and it would have given
     us a great deal of space outside the terraces.  I say it was
     fairly radical and probably fairly costly.

Q.   Do you know to what extent if at all that scheme was
     considered by the club? - A. I don't.   As I say, Mr.Moseley's
     letter says basically that on the second paragraph.

Q.   We now know various proposals were put forward in 1985, and we
     know what plan was eventually adopted.   Can you go to page 255
     and 256, just a small point.   The proposal which eventually
     went through was that a wall was built at the back of the West
     Stand? - A. Yes.

Q. And we see on the memo at page 256 you were asking for
   personnel doors to   be fitted in? - A. Yes.

Q. Obviously for ease     of access from one part of the    ground to
   another? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it right that originally there was a smaller door there
   than the gate? - A. A single width door.

Q.    And that was what you wanted at the time? - A. That's what we
     got. I d o n ’t say I wanted it.   I think it was one of these
     things - we wanted     a door.   We didn't really know at that
     stage how big we wanted the door.      We got effectively the one
     that is on the model, a normal house sized door, I believe,
     and we were stuck with that for a season.

Q. Your recollection is that the gateway or doorway that is there
   now has always been there since that wall was built? - A. Ho,
   the door that is there now was a single width door.  The door
   that is shown on the model is a single width door, similar to
   a house door.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   But it is wider than that in
     fact? - A. It is wider than that now.   It is a double width
     metal barred gate.   That was put in the season after.

Q.   So in 1985 you started off with a single width? - A. Yes.

Q. 1986 doubled? - A. As it is now.

Q.       MR. GOLDSACK:    Do you know at whose request it was
     increased in size? Was that a Police request? - A. That was
     at a Police request.   I believe there is a memo in.

Q. What was the thinking behind increasing the size the following
   year? - A. If we were using A-G turnstiles for away supporters
   but using the whole of the terraces we could not transfer
   them.  In fact we had several situations where we were using
   A-G but having to use the whole of the terraces when the south
                                  16

                                                       C. CALVERT


     and central pens were full and we wanted to open up to get
     into the north pen.   We had situations where in fact there was
     total chaos, people just could not get through the door.   It
     was dangerous.  On one or two Batches people were climbing
     over the wall in their urgency to get into there to see the
     game, and that is why it had to be done, just to give access
     when we wanted to use the      whole     of the terraces.

G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Itt=f«ct, using A-G for the whole of
     the terrace you were highly likely even with a double width
     door to get a much thinner crowd at the 6 and 7 pens than
     everywhere else, were not      you, because they had~t>© go through
     that door and all the way       round to get there? -A. Not really,
     sir.   We didn't find that in effect.

Q. We saw a photograph yesterday which certainly would seem to
   produce that result? - A. That was on the Semi-Final, I
   believe, sir.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who has got that photograph now?
     It ought to be exhibited. We were hoping to get some more
     copies. Never mind about it for the moment.

         THE WITNESS:    I believe I saw it from the back.

Q.       MR. GOLDSACK:   The brick wall was built at a time when
     segregation at the Leppings Lane end was all important? - A.
     Absolutely.

Q. In recent years the Leppings Lane end has been given over
   exclusively to away supporters.  Is that right? - A.
   Effectively since I think the beginning of 1987.  That was
   brought about mainly because the Kop opened and people wanted
   to go on the Kop.  We ended up with a situation where hardly
   anyone wanted to go on the Leppings Lane terraces, and the
   club then agreed, "Right, we won't have them.  It is easier".
   I think also it was Mr. Mackrell's appearance as secretary.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Have we got the photograph now? -
     A . Yes.

Q. You see what I mean? - A. I do, indeed, sir.          It has always
   been a problem of distribution.

Q. Don't you think that the long line of travel from A-G round to
   there through the personnel gate is one of the causative
   factors in that? - A. In this particular case it is.  In this
   particular incident at this game, yes, it is.

Q. Why not in others? - A. On the League matches we tended to
   control what was happening.  In the League matches we did not
   have the pressure.  We got a lot there, but the pressure was
   not as great.

Q. You filled them pen by pen? - A. Effectively, yes.  We would

   knew beforehand that we were going to get the whole lot

     filled, in which case we would plan for that.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   In the last two or three seasons when the
     Leppings Lane end has been given over entirely to away
     supporters has that wall played any useful purpose? - A. Not
     since segregation ended.

Q.    Do you know if any suggestion has been    made that it betaken
     down? - A. Not while I was involved.

Q.   Should not such a suggestion have been    made? - A. Y e s ,it
     should, with hindsight, having seen what has happened. Yes,
     it should.




                            /Q. When the 1985
t l                               18


                                                          C. CALVERT

      Q. When the 1985 proposals were being considered and going
         through there was a suggestion at one stage from the
         Police that there should be a second gate in the radial
         fences. - A. I have seen that on the papers.

      Q. Was that something that you initiated, that suggestion?
         - A. I have looked at it and I will be quite honest, I
         cannot remember initiating it.  I can remember it now
         but it was not one of my main priorities.

      Q. Can you remember what the specific purpose of the
         suggestion was? - A. Not really, no.

      Q. Go to page 265 and 6. Notes of an officer working party.
         You were not present. - A. No.

      Q. The matter I would just like your heip with is on page
         266, Letter I, a reference to the gates in the pitch
         perimeter fence being for both security access and
         emergency egress purposes. - A. Yes.

      Q. Was that your understanding? - A. Yes.  I heard the
         comment about the gates and I have always considered
         the gates were used for both purposes.

      Q. Did you give any thought as to what emergency might
         occur at that end of the ground? - A. One of the reasons
         I have seen the gates used for is when there has been
         fighting on the terraces and I have also seen it used
         when there has been a flare discharged, an emergency ships
         flare discharged on the terraces, which has caused
         total chaos.

      Q. And has that resulted in large numbers of people being
         evacuated on to the pitch?- A. We have certainly brought
         them out.  I would not say large numbers.

      Q. Because we now know that on the day this disaster occurred
         the gates were not large enough for people to come out
         either quickly or in any numbers.   Is that not something
         you have considered beforehand?- A. When we have had to
         use them for any purpose in the past they have been
         adequate for bringing the numbersfcootcwe wanted to bring
         out.  We have brought them out to transfer them round
         from one pen to the other when they have got themselves
         into the wrong area of the ground and certainly it has
         been adequate.

      Q.    Can you go, please, to page 292? These are the minutes
           of an officer working group, 13th of November, 1985, at
           which you were present. - A. Yes.

      Q.    And it is itemsJ5 and 6 thatI would like to ask you
           about.  Item 5, the Police reported on the continuing
                                 19



                                                         C. CALVERT

         problems caused by the merging of spectators from all
         parts of the stadium at the Leppings Lane end.  Now,
         what time are you talking about? -A. We are talking
         about after the match.

   Q.    That is at the end of the match. - A. Yes.

   Q.    And the observation made, difficult to see how this could
         be overcome? - A. It was difficult.

   Q. Now, item 6, duties of stewards booklet.  Agreed that a
      draft of a booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
      was acceptable and should be distributed.  Did you have
      anything to do with the drafting of that document? - A.
      No.  I believe this was a Headquarters publication.

v /Q .   Do you actually know which document that i s t ^ 4 . S o ,
         I:do not.                                  *

   Q. But it is a document you saw, is it, and was distributed?
      - A. I will be quite honest, I have given a lot of thought
      to that, and the only one I can remember is in 1985 I
      prepared some notes for the club after Popplewell of
      the kind of things that should be included but it
      certainly is not a booklet. It is not this booklet.

   Q.     Do you have the Sheffield Wednesday   file there? Look at
         page 46 in that file, 46, 47, 48, headed Sheffield
         Wednesday Football Club instructions for match days staff.
         Is that the document that you had some say in helping to
         produce?- A. This is not the one I produced.     Mine were
         notes of the kind of thing it should contain.     I had
         access to their pre~85 one and gave them what we con­
         sidered jointly, the Police at our Police Station, they
         should include.    I think it does include quite a lot of
         them but it is not the one I produced.

   Q.    Can you help us as to the date when   this document became
         in use? - A. I am sorry.  I cannot.

   Q. All right.   We will leave it. Go to page 294.   This is
      a document which was circulated late-85 by the Football
      Association to all clubs.   Did you ever see a copy of
      it?- A. I have certainly seen one from the Football
      Association.   It may be this.  It may be this one we
      used to approach the club about the Le^pings Lane end
      of the ground but I am not sure if it is this one.
      Certainly I have seen at that time a document, I believe,
      from the F.A. and this is probably it but I cannot be
      certain.

   Q. Can I just draw your attention to B(2) on page 295, Bs
      being prior planning and item (2) saying the rnrnber of
      Police and stewards to operate at each match must be
ej                               20


                                                         C. CALVERT

         agreed with the Police.  Was that in practice done as
         from beginning of 1986?- A. No, certainly we did not go
         and say this is what we are doing at each matcht  If we
         felt there were any particular problems we would have
         approached them.  I think it is mentioned in a document
         somewhere that we asked for extra stewards when the Kop
         opened.

     Q. Well now, coming to the 1985/86 season, this is prior to
        your request in August, 1986, for barrier 144 to be
        removed. - A. Yes.

     Q. Were you getting some fairly large crowds in that season?
        - A. Yes.  Sheffield Wednesday had gone into the First
        Division and we were experiencing fairly large crowds.

     Q.During that season, 1985 to 1986, what policy were you
        adopting so far as putting people in the Leppings Lane
        terraces was concerned?- A. With small crowds of away
        supporters we would probably know beforehand within
        a hundred or so how many we would get and we would
        decide which pen we were going to use and just open
        that pen.   If it was a large crowd we would agree
        with the club that we would use the whole of that
        end of the ground and fill pens - initially we
        started trying to fill them sequentially.   We found
        with that those who arrived would be usually put in
        the south pen; when the central pen or the other pens
        were open there would be a movement.   Equally, if we
        used the central pen there would be those who wanted
        to move elsewhere and because the concourse at the backfc
        is open and that is where the facilities are people
        would be moving from pen to pen, so we would decide
        how many pens we would use and allow them into the pens
        and control, if we considered it, when it was full.

     Q. So at those smaller matches was that physically done by
        the Police as opposed to stewards? -A. Well, at the
        smaller matches we would just put barriers across the one
        we did not intend to use and a couple of Police Officers
        behind them and they would go into the pen that was open.

     Q. Yes.  It would be Police Officers behind barriers .... - A.
        Oh, yes.

     Q        not stewards? - A. We decided it.   It was a policing
         operation, that side of it.

     Q. So by late in that season do we have the situation where
        effectively you were letting the crowd find its own level
        on the terrace at the larger matches? - A. To an extent,
        we were monitoring what was happening.

     Q. Now, what was it that caused the Police to want barrier

         144 taken out?

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR:Just before you move on to
         that, have I followed this?   If you tried to fill them
         sequentially those you put into your first choice pen
         when the next one was opened would move themselves
         across? -A.They would try to because ....

    Q.   What?   Over the fence or ....   - A. Over the fence.

    Q ..... coming out and going in   again? - A. Coming out, §oing
        to the toilets, going to the refreshments and then going
        wherever they wanted.

    Q.    So then you said you decided    how many you were going to
         use and opened all those you     were going to use? - A. Yes,
         sir.

    Q. But you said it was a policing operation.       You decided ....
       - A. Yes.

    Q         when any pen was full.      Is that right?- A. Yes.

    Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:    Wellnow,sit is mid-1986 the
         request is made for barrier 144 to come down? - A. Yes,
         sir.

    Q, I think if we just look at the documentation at page 319,
       that is the notes of a meeting between Police representatives
       and the club. - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. You are not in fact present.  Three items pethaps just
       worthy of note. The first item is that the stewards'
       instructions are to be updated.  Access at Leppings Lane.
       There appears to be a discussion about the wider door.
       And then the West Stand, the possibility of removing
       certain crush barriers at the Leppings Lane standing
       area was discussed as this would assist the flow of fans
       into the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. What had you as Liaison Officer noticed was the problem
       as people came through the tunnel? - A. The barrier was
       right across the entrance to the tunnel and the fans
       got to the barrier and stopped and we would have a build­
       up right back up the tunnel, fans would not move out and
       we could not control what was happening.  The whole of
       that area would be empty at the front and we could not
       get them in through the barrier.  That was the best - I
       think it has already been said - that was probably one
       of the best viewing points and we had considerable dis­
       cussions right from the middle of the season.  This
       was brought by various officers.  I put it together
       in a report, discussed it with the Superintendents
                           22


                                                    C. CALVERT

   and it was raised here and we agreed to take it to the
   working party at the next inspection for their views.

Q. Was any experiment tried at having personnel, either
   Police or stewards, near to those barriers trying to
   persuade people to move further in?- A. It was but,
   quite honestly, it was just a case of you had to have -
   we did it with Police Officers and it was not particularly
   effective.    You had to have quite a lot of people there,
   just posh them sidsways.      I think stewards would probably
   have been just about as effective.      People got there,-
   here I a m sand;here* Ia stand.

Q. So in effect you were detailed by senior Officers to
   bring this up at the next officer working party? - A.
   That is right.  I believe, in fact I know Mr. Beale
   was there with me.  He is shown on this document.

Q. And we know that the inspection was on the 7th of August.
   - A. That is correct.

Q. And the note we have of that is at page 341.  Were you
   aware, Mr. Calvert, that the capacity, the safe capacity
   of the terrace, was connected with the numbering and
   positioning of crush barriers? - A. I know that in my
   report I said that we would have to consult the committee
   because of the implications of it in regards to the Green
   Guide.

                                                  C. CALVERT


Q . That was a concern to you then? - A . That was a concern, y e s .
    I wanted to get the best I could.

Q. Did that sketch go to the club? - A. Yes.

Q. So they knew of your concern in that regard? - A. I gave them
   a sketch. I probably did the ideal. I gave the then
   secretary the sketch.   Mr. Moseley then discussed it
   with him later, and I think the letter is on the
   file, but certainly Mr. Moseley knew it was not just
   a simple, "Let's just go for segregation".  We both
   took the view, "Let's get it right".

Q.   Now, between 1981 and 1985 you were attempting to get some
     arrangement with the club whereby it was made clear to the
     stewards what their function was? - A. I think not just me.     I
     think the senior Officers generally were.

Q. And others.  The difficulty is that two documents came into
   existence, one from the club and one from the South Yorkshire
   Police, both of which purported to give instructions to
   stewards, and in neither of which was crowd packing referred
   to as part of their responsibilities? - A. The documents came
   into being after Popplewell or after the fire but I think
   before the final Report.  The principal concern was safety
   stewards after the incident at Bradford, so that the stewards
   would know what their duties were in an emergency, that the
   club would have everything sorted so they would know what
   would happen in the event of an emergency evacuation
   situation, although in my report in here it certainly says
   that there is a responsibility on the stewards for certain
   items of movement of supporters.

Q. But what matters to the stewards is not what you say to
   somebody else, it is what is said to them. - A. Mine was
   submitted to the secretary of the club really to incorporate
   as he wished, but those were the points that we considered
   should be included for the stewards to know what to do.

Q.   Mr. Calvert, I aim not suggesting in any way you are to blame
     for this. - A. No, sir.

Q.   I am trying to find out what you were aware of.  Before this
     Inquiry were you aware that the only written instructions
     given to the stewards, one coming from the Police and one from
     the club, that in neither of them was it mentioned it was part
     of their duties to monitor the overcrowding of part of the
     terraces? - A. I was not ware  of that.

Q.   That is news to you, is it? -   A. Yes.

Q.   One of the problems is this, that in April 1985 you attended a
     meeting of the officer working party on 18th April, 1985, page
     211, and you were the South Yorkshire Police representative,
     and Mr. Grimshaw, an Assistant Divisional Officer was there
     from the Fire Service? - A. Yes.

                                                 C. CALVERT


Q. Now, we have the official minute of that meeting.  I am not
   sure who in fact drew it up? - A. I would think it would be
   M r . Vaughan.

Q. We then turn to another document which you won't have seen.
   It is not a document so much.   It is evidence given by Mr.
   Seaman of the Fire Service.   I want you to understand what he
   says is hearsay because he was not there, but understands that
   Mr. Grimshaw, the Fire Officer, raised specifically with the
   working party the question of the numbers of spectators being
   allowed into each section of the terraces and the control of
   them to prevent overcrowding, and Mr. Grimshaw's apparent
   recollection is that the Police stated that arrangements that
   they had with the club were satisfactory, that is in relation
   to density packing, and they felt that the provision of
   smaller sections on the terraces would make overall control of
   the terrace easier.

          Now, it is a little unfair, obviously, to ask you to
     remember what happened at that meeting, particularly since the
     minute produced by Mr. Vaughan makes no reference to that
     matter, but do you recollect that meeting and that discussion
     taking place? - A. Not on those lines, no.

Q. Do you remember Mr. Grimshaw? - A. I know Mr. Grimshaw.

Q. How many meetings did you attend with Mr. Grimshaw? - A. Over
   the years, quite a few.  Over the years quite a few occasions
   I have met him.

Q.   So it would not be fair to ask you to recollect this
     particular meeting? - A. Not this particular one, no.

Q. What I want to ask you is this.   Never mind what Mr. Grimshaw
   says about it, in 1985 if you had been asked, "Is there an
   arrangement between the Police and the club for the proper
   packing of the terraces?", what would your answer have been? -
   A. I think "arrangement" is the wrong word.   We did it.
   "Packing" is the wrong word as well.   Filling.  Certainly I
   have described what happened.   If we    had one pen to be used we
   would only use one   pen.  We would fill them as need be and
   monitor them.

Q. The problem is this, Mr. Calvert, I just wanted to make sure
   in fairness to you that we have understood your evidence.  It
   would appear to be this, that whereas you regarded the proper
   filling of terraces, and I accept your correction - everyone
   else has been using the word "packing", but it is a little
   unfair - the proper filling of a terrace to prevent
   overcrowding, you regarded that as the club's responsibility
   but you took it upon yourself to do it in the absence of the
   club doing it? - A. To make things work on the day we did.

Q. But the trouble with that, of course, is this, is not it, that
   if it was not laid   down anywhere, if  there was no agreement
   with the club, and  if it was done by   the Police on an ad hoc
   basis, there might come a day when a Police Officer in charge

     would say, "This is not our responsibility.  It is the club's
     responsibility, and we are not doing it", and the club would
     say, "Well, it is not our responsibility because the Police
     have always done it", and then it does not get done.  Had you
     ever appreciated that? - A. During my tern of office there,
     no, it had not.  That did not occur.

Q. Looking back on it, do you accept that this may well have been
   a danger arising out of what was being done ad hoc by the
   Police before April 1989? -A. In retrospect I think there were
   lots of things which should have been put on a formal basis.

Q. And you accept so far as you are concerned, and it may be that
   other people may have done it and you <tid not know, but as far
   as you are concerned there were no formal arrangements ever
   made between the Police and the club as to who was responsible
   for the proper and safe filling of the terraces? - A. No
   formal arrangements, sir, that I was aware of.

Q. I just want to ask you now about your plan which you call the
   ideal and which I would suggest is a very sensible one.  Would
   you look at this plan.  This is the one that has been done by
   the architect on our instructions.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Have I got it?

          MR. HYTNER:   Oh, yes, it is the one I put to Dr.
     Eastwood, and Dr. Eastwood said that yes, with alterations it
     was perfectly viable:

Q. That sketch, because that is all it is, shows a similar
   arrangement, not identical, but a similar one to the one you
   roughly sketched and sent to the club? - A. Very similar, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, Mr. Hytner.  It may be
     my fault but I am not sure I have actually had it, have it?

          MR. HYTNER:   You have, but I have another copy.  I took
     it very shortly with Dr. Eastwood because he gave a very broad
     answer.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes, that is right.   I have it.

Q.        MR. HYTNER:   As it so happens the suggestion you made
     was identical to the one I originally put to one of the Police
     witnesses but which was not incorporated in the sketch, and
     that is a parallel wall, a straight wall, for all the
     turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. And that actually could easily be done as an amendment to this
   sketch? -A. I think the only difference is that mine was
   probably closer to the rear of the stand, and it was a
   parallel wall across the full width.  Basically, it is very
   similar.

Q. I would actually endorse your suggestion of the completely
   parallel wall, because then you can get parallel queues coming

                                                    C. CALVERT


   away from the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. But the other advantage of this sketch which is identical to
   yours and which you had picked up a very, very long time ago,
   is that it gives far greater space between the turnstiles and
   the blue gates? - A. The outside gates?

Q. The outside gates. - A. Yes, absolutely.

Q. And that is something that you actually appreciated a very
   long time ago, the need for greater space between the
   turnstiles and the outer gates? - A. I think we all
   appreciated.  It was just a case of how we could get it done.

Q. You say you all appreciated it? So far as to your knowledge
   did the club appreciate the need for greater space in that
   area? - A. I can't really say what the club appreciated.

Q. The reason I asked you that was you said, "We all appreciated
   it". - A. I meant on the Police side.  Certainly my then Chief
   Superintendent realised what we were intending.

Q. Because frankly, the reason you appreciated it was that it was
   obvious from the configuration at the end of Leppings Lane
   that given a large crowd the existing area was too small for
   safety? - A. It is an awkward little corner to say the least.

Q. Yes.    Thank you.

        MR. COLLINS:   Sir, before Mr. Muller cross-examines, Mr.
   Hytner raised the matter in relation to the 18th April 1985
   meeting with Mr. Grimshaw.  You will recall, sir, that we
   asked Mr. Grimshaw because he was not going to be available to
   give evidence to give us his recollection of what had
   occurred, and I have had a written document which I
   think came from the Fire Service in which that is set
   out.  I had understood that that had been circulated.
   I am told now it may not have been.

          MR. HYTNER:   I have not seen it.

        MR. COLLINS:   It is a single sheet of paper.  What I
   will do now is to get it copied and circulated very quickly
   and suggest that no-one asks any questions about it until they
   receive the written document, and if anyone does want to ask
   any questions arising out of they can do so when they see the
   document.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        It might be a good idea as it is
   so short....

        MR. HYTNER:     I hope it has not rendered my questioning
   unfair.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        If you read it out and then it is
   in evidence.

                                                 C. CALVERT


          MR. COLLINS: I will do that.  I will read'it out and
   then we will get copies of it.  It is very short.  It says
   thi s :

        "The police indicated that with the system in operation
        since 1981 involving their officers controlling the
        terrace and the cl u b ’s stewards directing spectators as
        necessary behind the west stand, they had not experienced
        any difficulty with over-crowding of the existing pens up
        to that date in 1985 and they could not see there
        being any difficulty in controlling the proposed
        smaller pens, particularly as there was to be
        segregated turnstile access to each of the
        original three areas on the terrace.

        It was made clear by Divisional Officer Grimshaw that the
        gates at the rear of the radial fences were required for
        use in case of any emergency to allow lateral egress from
        the terrace and assurance was given that the police had
        and would continue to man the existing gates and would
        also man the proposed gates in the new fences".

   So effectively it is a confirmation of Mr. Seaman’s evidence,
   with perhaps some small qualification.  But, sir, I will get
   that copied now and it will be circulated.  That is as I
   understand it what Mr. Grimshaw wrote at our request as his
   recollection of the events.

        MR. HYTNER:   It has reminded me of one question I ought
   to have put, if I could put it now:

Q. Could I clear one matter up, which you have made pretty clear
   yourself, Mr.   Calvert. The question of whether stewards went
   on to a terrace is not the same thing as saying that a steward
   is responsible for monitoring the overcrowding on a terrace,
   is it? - A. No.

Q. You would not want a steward on a terrace for all sorts of
   reasons? - A. It depends on the terrace, sir.     The Spion Kop I
   don't see any great problem because of the gangways.     If there
   are gangways I d o n ’t see any problems, whether it is home or
   away supporters, but those particular terraces referring to
   Leppings Lane without gangways, I think it would difficult for
   them, to say the least.

Q. And also in fairness to them, you would not necessarily expect
   on a Semi-Final day Sheffield stewards to be within the
   Liverpool crowd? - A. They were with the Nottingham Forest
   supporters, sir, and they have certainly been with other
   supporters in the past on the Kop.

Q. I won't press that.  The point is that the actual monitoring
   of the crowd is better done from outside the terrace, viewing
   from the fence or elsewhere? - A. On those particular terraces
   it can't be done from inside.

Q. That is it.   Thank you.

          MR. P.W. JACKSON:   My Lord, Mr. Jackson has to be
     elsewhere today.  May I cross-examine in his absence?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes, certainly.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. P.W. JACKSON:

Q. Mr. Calvert, just one question on 1987.  In your statement at
   pages 3 and 4 you say you went to great pains because of Leeds
   United's reputation to prevent fans from arriving without
   tickets? -A. Yes.

Q. And to contain any fans that did arrive without tickets.
   Could you tell the Inquiry what steps were taken to prevent
   fans arriving without tickets? - A. Yes.  To my recollection
   Leeds United had just had an away supporters ban, and we had a
   meeting with their club secretary, and they were quite
   concerned about an element of their support who were
   travelling and had travelled without tickets to away games.
   They have a reputation, had a reputation.  We monitored them
   in conjunction with the Leeds Police both at the railway
   stations and on the coaches coming into the city, at
   Tankersley off the Ml, and various other locations as they got
   to the ground.

Q. So you would be deliberately checking tickets when people came
   out of the train stations and coaches? - A. Yes.   We also
   arranged with Leeds to have a closed-circuit link.   Again it
   was all done with the agreement, not just agreement but
   request of their club because of what had happened in the
   past.  In fact, we got very little problems with people
   without tickets.

Q.   Were   any steps taken to check those who did not come by way of
     coach or rail? - A. Yes.  Those in cars checked at they
     approached the ground.   We were amazed how few there were.

Q. Was there a cordon of Police Officers checking tickets around
   the ground? - A. "Cordon” is the wrong word.  Certainly there
   were checks.

Q. What steps were taken to contain any people who did arrive
   without tickets? I appreciate not many did. - A. We had made
   arrangements, I am not sure where we would take them, but
   certainly we would contain them, dependent on numbers, if it
   was 200 or 300, in the pen outside the turnstiles.   If it was
   more we had various contingencies in hand to move them around.

Q.   They were not going to be allowed into the ground? - A. No,
     certainly not.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. MULLER:

Q.   Inspector Calvert, I want to take you back to 1961, the
     Wolves-Spurs match, and the debriefing at which you were
     present. - A . Y e s .

                                                  C. CALVERT



Q. Would you kindly turn to page 127 in the bundle.  You were
   present at that debriefing and took part in the discussion? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Can I ask you this.  In the discussion which took place* and
   reference is made to it at page 128, am I right in
   understanding that no suggestion was made on the information
   that was then available, that something should be done about
   the perimeter gates to make them wider or anything of that
   kind? - A. No, I can't recall it, sir.  I don't think it is in
   here, and I can't recall it.

Q. And of course, this was a situation    not unlike the one that
   has recently arisen at Hillsborough,    in which people had to be
   taken off - in fact it was gate 2 -    off the terrace, who were
   under pressure? - A . I think it was   gate 1 in fact.




                         /Q. So be it

                                                          C. CALVERT

    Q. So be it.  But people under pressure who had to be removed
       from the terrace? - A. There were a number removed because
       of the pressure and there were a lot more went over the
       top for their own purposes where there certainly was not
       any pressure.

    Q. Is this not the position, that one of the matters about
       which complaint at that time was being made against the
       Police was far from being wrong in not letting people
       out, they had let too many people out? - A. The Chairman
       of the club expressed that view quite strongly to the
       Chief Constable of the day.

    Q.    And the problem had been that once the gate was open it
         was very difficult to shutiit and people just continued
         pouring out for their own reasons? - A. Yes.

    Q. Nothing to do with crushing at all.-     A. Yes.   And came
       over the top.

    Q.   And am I right in understanding that not only at that time
         but at no subsequent time did anything happen in relation
         to the use of the perimeter gates which indicated to the
         Police those gates should be made wiier on the information
         that was then available? - A. No, nothing.

    Q. And certainly nothing was ever said to the working party
       about it? - A. No.

    Q. And then of course as a result of that the radial fences
       were introduced, were no&fc they? - A. Yes, basically.

    Q.   At that time when the radial fences were first introduced
         in 1981 am I right in saying there was no suggestion in
         the working party that the Police or the club were having
         any difficulty in controlling the number of people going
         into the terrace or going ift&o those particular pens? - A.
         Certainly not in 1981.

    Q. No.  Indeed, in 1981 had that matter crossed your mind
       you would have been urging for turnstiles devoted to
       particular sections of the pens, would not you? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Because this was an idea that was going through your   mind,
         was it, in 1981? - A. Not in 1981.   I think ....

    Q. It was later, was it?- A. It was a lot later.  You have
       got to regard the position of Sheffield Wednesday in the
       various leagues.

    Q. So it was not a matter that occurred to you?       So be it.
       - A. No, not in 1981.

    Q. Can we then just have a look for a moment at those radial gates and

            fences? Could you pleasfe turn to 153 in the bundlk®
            Now, I appreciate that you were not present at that
            meeting.  It was the meeting at which the radial fences
            were first approved of in 1981, is that right, by the
            working party and the stipulation was made that they
            should be under Police control?- A. That is the record, yes.

         Q. And it was of course for the Police, once that had been
            drawn to their attention, to carry out that instruction?
            - A. Yes.

         Q. To control it. Were you aware when you were trying or
            when the Police were trying to interpret that of the
            way in which the Green Guide at that time, that is to
            say, in 1981, dealt with the question of controlling
            the perimeter gates? -A. Not offhead.

         Q. You see, if we look at the Green Guide, and I do not
            want to be tedious about it but I must draw your
            attention to it since I asked the question, what it
            says at 792 is access points should be controlled -
            this is perimeter gates - so that immediate access
            to the pitch or perimeter track can be ensured in
            the event of an emergency. - A. The perimeter gates
            were controlled.

         Q. They were controlled and how were they controlled?
            - A. The perimeter gates always had a Police Officer
            on the track.

         Q. Yes. What was happening, when it came to the question
            of control in relation to perimeter gates, the requirements
            for control was carried out by having an Officer in the
            immediate vicinity of the gate? -A. Yes.

         Q. Now, in the context of that Green Guide, a further
            requirement for controlling another gate is imposed
            on the Police? - A. I do not think we ever understoods
            it as that.

         Q. What I am asking you, you see, is whywkhen the word
            control is used in that way in relation to the perimeter
            gate you applied a different meaning to it when it came
            to the radial gate? - A. I do not think we understood it
            as an evacuation gate.  Merely an access gate.  Certainly
            the senior Officers who attended I am sure did not believe
            it to be an evacuation gate, merely an access gate.

         Q. If the position arose that the tunnel was blocked, which
            could happen, I suppose, could not it? - A. Yes.

         Q. And you realised in the Green Guide there had to be an
            alternative means of escape? - A. Yes.

     Q. People would have to be taken to left and right through
        those radial gates, would not they? - A. The perimeter
        gates.

     Q. Through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes, the perimeter ....

     Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     No, no, you are at cross-
          purposes. - A. Sorry.

     Q. He is talking about the gates at the top of the radial
        fences. - A. Yes, sir.  I am saying he is talking about
        evacuation through there.  I am saying the evacuation,
        as far as we were concerned, would be on to the pitch
        if we had to.

     Q.        MR. MULLER: You are   suggesting the alternative
          route would be through the perimeter gates.  Is that
          right? - A. We would use them.

     Q. If the perimeter gates were to be envisaged as a means
        through which the wfiole of the pen should be evacuated
        in an emergency then the Green Guide required that*it
        should be 1.3ametre wide even in 1976, did not it? - A.
        It did, sir.

     Q. Were not you then concerned about that if that is how
        you saw it? -A. No, sir, I was not concerned.  We have
        heard that the gates on either end would be used for
        evacuation in an emergency.

     Q.   Either end of what? - A. Of the ground.

     Q.    Yes. - A. And they would be and these gates were put in
          and our understanding of control is that if they were
          locked or closed there would be a Police Officer behind
          them and that was the case and is the case and if they
          were open they would be open for people to flow through.

     Q. Can I just understand? Are you saying that it was the
        Police understanding that if the tunnel became blocked
        the alternative means of escape for all the people who
        were in pens 3 and 4 was to be through the perimeter
        gate? -A. That would be one of the uses.  You have brought
        these up.  Obviously you would.  You would use whatever
        means possible.

     Q. But did you not appreciate, the point I am putting to you,
        that if anybody, including the Police, were contemplating
        that the perimeter gate could in any circumstances be used
        to evacuate all the people in those pens ....

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not think that is what is
          being said, Mr. Muller.   As I understand it - we have been
          through this a number of times - what the Officer is saying
iw                               45


                                                         C. CALVERT

          is there is a distinction between what is said in here
          about access points being controlled where ypo have got
          the perimeter gates shut.  If you have got the radial
          gates open he is saying that is control!becioeettfcbetae
          Police can control whether they are opened or they are
          not.  You do not have to have a Police Officer there
          once they are open and we have been through it a number
          of times and I think he is saying that if the tunnel is
          shut he would use the perimeter gate as well as any other
          method which would include the radial gate.

               MR. MULLER:   So be it:

     Q, Could I just then pursue these particular gates with you?
        Once the control rests with the Police it is for the Police
        to make their decision as to what degree of control they
        will impose.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

     Q. And in some cases that control will involve permanent
        manning, that is to say, throughout the game? - A. In
        certain circumstances.

     Q. Yes.  Can I just ask you then in this connection, if you
        are seeking to control the number of people going into the
        different pens which you had to do in order to avoid over­
        packing, am I right? - A. Yes.

     Q. One of the things you could do would be to close the tunael?
        - A. Yes.

     Q. If you close the tunnel and leave the radial gate open you
        have defeated the object of closing the tunnel, have not
        you, because people can get round the .... - A. Theoretically,
        sir, yes, effectively no.

     Q.    Effectively no. - A. Effectively/no.  Those gates were very
          little used for that purpose.   People could flow through
          them at will if they wished but very seldom did and it did
          not affect the packing at all.

     Q. Can I ask you about this then? Inspector White apparently
        told his serials who were responsible for that area that
        there should be two men, two of his men would be posted
        one to each of the radial gates in the event of an emer­
        gency but he was indicating that really was not a very
        practical thing for them to do because they would have
        great difficulty in getting there.  Do you follow me?
        - A. I do.

     Q. If an emergency arose. - A. Yes.

     Q. If that is right that means, does not it, that in order
        to overcome that difficulty you have got to station
        somebody there all the time? - A. I do not know where
                          46



                                                 C. CALVERT

   Mr. White got his instructions from but that certainly
   was not part of the evacuation procedures.  The
   evacuation procedures were that the perimeter gates
   would be manned and opened on the given instructions
   and all the rear gates, any internal gates, particularly
   in the South stand, would be manned and all of them apart
   from the perimeter gates would be double-manned by Police
   and stewards.  I do not know where Inspector White got
   that instruction from.  I was not aware he had given it.
   In fact I was only aware when I heard his evidence here
   and, as far as I was aware, that was not part of the
   procedures.

Q. According to the members of his serial he said that
   normally speaking those radial gates would be manned,
   that is to say, on a normal League game, but on this
   occasion he deputed two people to go to those places
   in anfemergency.     Are you saying he was wrong in giving
   that instruction? - A. I am saying he was wrong.  I have
   carried out practice evacuation procedures several times
   when I have gone round all the places where Police Officers
   and stewards should be with club representatives and
   other Police Officers and that was not a place we went to.
   That was not part of our system.

Q. Can you help me about this?   If those radial gates were
   to be used at all for the purposes of evacuation then it
   is essential that people should know where they were?
   - A. If they were to be, yes.

Q. The only way in practical terms that you could make people
   aware of where they were would be by putting a Police
   Officer there when the emergency arose? - A. I do not
   think that would be effective at all.

Q. How else could you draw it to somebody's attention, that
   it was there? - A. The practicalities are that a Policeman
   would be swamped in the crowd.  The practicalities also
   are that if the central pen had to be evacuated either
   the North or the South pens would have to be evacuated
   first.  So therefore Police Officers would evacuate them
   from the back on either side, assuming the tunnel was
   blocked, which would leave a space for people to flow
   into.  Until that space was created nothing could be done.

Q. With respect, Officer, that is not right, is it, because
   if you give an instruction over the Tannoyfeto evacuate
   people from 1 and 2, which of course could have been done
   on this occasion but was never done, what happens then as
   soon as you tell people to mowe from the terrace they
   will naturally go, won't they, towards the South Side
   of the West stand and that immediately creates a vacuum?
   - A. I do not know, sir, because we have never had to do
   it. We have planned it. We have never had to do it. I
S\e                             47

         have not been involved in an actual evacuation situation.
         We knew what we would do.  The practicalities on the day,
         I just do not know what would have happened.  I am sure
         that our planning would have allowed them from the centre
         to go out if it ....

      Q. Inspector Calvert, is it not a    matter of common sense
         that once you are instructing    people toleave pens 1
         and 2 first of all they would    go out of that 1 and 2
         via the south tunnel? - A. By    the south, yes ....

      Q. That is obvious, is not it? - A. Yes.

      Q. They would immediately start moving in that direction,
         would not they?- A. Yes.

  #   Q. So you immediately create a vacuum at the North side
         pens 1 and 2? - A. Yes.
                                                                    of


      Q. So that people can then immediately emerge from pen 3 into
         that pen? - A. If a vacuum is created and ana evacuation
         taking place  it will fill without any assistance at all.
         A single Police Officer in a situation you say would be
         totally lost at those gates.

      Q. I see. Would you please have a lo®k in the Green Guide
         1980 at paragraph 50? - A. I have not got the Green Guide
         with me, sir.

      Qivlave you not? Perhaps it can be provided for you.    What
         it says there is a smooth free flow through an exit
         route to the outside is best achieved by controlling
         the crowd flow at the entrance to the exit ....

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am sorry, Mr. Muller.
         The arguments about having a single Police Officem
         at the radial gate have been fully deployed.  I think
         I am going to have to decide about that.  I do not
         think we are going to be able to take it any further.
         The Officer has given ....

              MR. MULLER:   This relates to another matter.
         This relates to the width or number of radial gates.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Very well.

              Supposing you have got fans arriving early, refusing to move
              so there is a bottle neck, and I think talk not on this
              occasion but on other occasions, of back-filling up the
              tunnel. Did that occur on occasions? - A . Y e s ,
              certainly.

           Q. Now, if the Police on the ground are conscious that the tunnel
                            back-filling and fans are not actually getting
              int-o it-, would it not be quite a natural thing for a Police
              Officer to say, "We had better shut off that tunnel because
              the crowd is already backing up it"? - A. It would be, but I
              have just thought, if we look at the debrief, Mr. Chapman
              mentions that he put Officers on to the terraces to move them.

           Q. Sideways? - A. Yes.

           Q. But the two d o n ’t necessarily conflict, do they? To block off
              the central tunnel, to stop more people going in where there
              is a jam and then to cone on to the terraces and try to
              alleviate the jam sideways? - A. No, alleviate it at the
              centre.  I think that is what it means, gone down, moved them
              from the entrance and leave them to flow in once the gap is
              created.

           Q. At all events, one possible understanding of it would be this,
              that the first event is that fans arrive ea^ly, cause blocking
              of entrance, next event Police shut off entrance because fans
              back-filling, the third event jam at sides. - A. I don't
              think that is the logical way it would be done, but if you
              have a problem with blockage th# logical thing is to clear it,
              if you have a space in front of it.   If there is no space in
              front of it there is no |X)int in doing it.  If you have a
              space in front the logical thing, is to get the people who are
              causing the blockage out into where the space is.

           Q. One reason why I toiioh on thi*{.:j|atter is this, you were asked
              when it cam^ on some years later for the removal of 144 which
              you were concerned about because it was causing blockages, you
              were asked whether this was a mere convenience factor or a
              safety factor.  If the Police analysis in the letter to the FA
              is correct back in 1981 they appear to have attributed the
              crushing at the perimeters to an obstruction of the central
              entrance? - A. Yes.

           Q. So that is one way that if you allow a central entrance to
              become obstructed it may cause jamming and injury elsewhere? -
              A. That is correct.

           Q. Other relevant factors from the safety angle would be these,
              would they not, if you have got a build up of fans trying to
              get in and there is obstruction, do the fans always remain
              even tempered or do people sometimes become irate? - A.
              Frequently they become very irate.

           Q. Was that one of the matters in the page you produced a moment
              ago and we had not seen before, your report at the end of the
              season, on that front page, "Fans getting irate and turning on
a
                                    60

                                                      C. CALVERT


         the Police", was one of the matters raised as a source of
         concern? - A. Yes. This is always a source of concern.

    Q.    Would it also lead on occasions to jostling    and pushing and
         disorderly behaviour? - A. Fans may be supporting the same
         club, but it does not mean to say they w o n ’t be awkward with
         their own people.

    Q.   Right.   May Igo back to the question I was going to ask you
         about the letter at page 235.  You see paragraph {b);

                ’’Central area of the terrace being divided in half by a
                new central radial fence from the tunnel entrance to the
                pitch side security fence, with gates erected, so as to
                permit entry to be diverted to either half as


         Yes.

    Q. Now, it was never in anybody’s contemplation, was it, that the
       two halves of the central pen would be allocated to opposing
       spectators? - A. Never.

    Q.   That would be absurd, because they would be going up the
         tunnel together mingling, and then you would say,"Sheep  one
         side, goats the other"? - A. No.

    Q.    So that central radial fence was never ever intended    for fan
         segregation purposes, but always for fan control purposes? -
         A. No, it is not quite correct what you say, sir.     In
         segregation the pen 5 I think you referred to i t , or is it 4,
         would be kept closed if necessary, and pens 1, 2 and 3 opened
         for away supporters.    We then have a large segregation gap in
         pen 4.

    Q. Point taken.      You might have one half of it absolutely empty?
       - a . Yes.

    Q. But in circumstances, that is not the reason put forward for
       its introduction in the letter.  The reason put forward is so
       you can divert to one half or the other? - A. Yes.

    Q. And that is what you are contemplating, you are going to be
       having the same side's fans coming up the tunnel and it is a
       factor of filtering them? - A. Yes.

    Q. Enabling you to fill evenly? - A. Yes.

    Q. It was during that following season, because these radials
       came in in 1985, during the following season you said you got
       constant reports from Police Officers that there was now this
       problem of congestion at the mouth of the tunnel? - A. That is
       right.

    Q. So much so that you decided or the Police thought something
       ought to be done about it? - A . Y e s .
                               61


                                                  C. CALVERT


Q. Do you have the Guide there, please? - A. Yes.

Q. Just a couple of short passages may I invite your attention
   to.  Page 26.  Just read to yourself the top three lines in
   bold print. - A . Y e s .

Q. And also it refers to Chapter 5 on ingress.      Page 20, the top
   two lines in bold print. - A. Yes.

Q. Is smooth ingress - it may be an obvious question - is smooth
   ingress desirable in safety interests? - A . Y e s .

Q. Of course, under "Ingress” there, the next paragraph, page 20
   paragraph 44, goes on to make the point that where admission
   to ground is controlled by turnstiles these control the rate
   of admission.  Turnstiles will obviously control the rate of
   admission, will they not, when the fans are coming through the
   turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. So at the time when the 1986 removal of barrier 144 was being
   discussed you had the situation where there were reports of
   this blockage leading to back-filling? - A. Yes.

Q. The fans were going to be coming at a controlled rate as you
   understood it through the turnstiles? - A. Normally, yes.

Q. And there would be people to shut off a pen as and when it
   became full? -A. That was the practice.

Q. If the fans were going to be coming in at a controlled rate
   through the turnstiles and somebody was going to be shutting
   off the gate when a pen was full, do you see any risk in terms
   of crowd crushing by removing that one barrier? -A. If I had
   considered that possibility I would not have asked for it.

Q. Quite.  But what we appear to have had on the day is the
   different scenario of crowd coming in, not controlled by the
   turnstiles but with the gate opened, and into a pen already
   full? - A. Yes.

Q. May we put the question another way.  Supposing if you are
   covering that contingency where you have a large number coming
   in at an uncontrolled rate, and supposing 144 had been there
   causing back-filling up the tunnel so you have this throng
   coming up the tunnel when people are already in the tunnel,
   what then, Inspector Calvert? - A. The possibility is the
   location of most of the casualties would have moved up the
   tunnel.

Q.   Does it come to this, you just c a n ’t get a quart in a pint
     bottle? - A. In the circumstances of this particular event,
     yes.

Q.   At that meeting in August, 1986 I think you said that     Mr.
     Strange - your word - gave some input on possible
     alternative configurations? - A. Yes.

                                                 C. CALVERT


Q. And none of them were viable? - A. I am not an expert, but
   that was the consensus of the people who were.

Q. The alternative possibilities were discussed and rejected? -A.
   Yes.

Q. Did he also raise, because he says he did and he reported to
   Dr. Eastwood that he did, raise the consequence in terms of
   calculated capacity, because the club would not like losing
   capacity if they could avoid it, and the view was expressed
   that removing tfcis barrier was going to make the terrace
   safer? - A. I d o n ’t recall him speaking to nve about capacity.

Q. You did not regard capacity as your concern, not your
   responsibility? - A. We had an interest in it, but I did not
   regard it as my prime concern.

Q. Is this it, you are not saying he is wrong.  You say you just
   don't recall it? - A. I am not saying he is wrong at all.

Q. No.  Your view would have been if asked, would not it, that
   the removal of that barrier was going to make it safer? - A. I
   think that was part of the discussion.  In fact, I am sure
   that was part of the discussion.  We put all the problems
   forward.

Q. Can I just go back to one previous occasion.  Would you go
   back in the bundle to pages 169-170.  This relates to a time
   when the first radials had gone in and the Police were
   suggesting that there should be a free strip either side of
   the radial barrier going right down to the ground. Do you
   recall? - A. I don't particularly recall it.  I have read
   the documents in the bundle.

Q. At all events, it is not a letter to you.   It is a letter from
   Eastwoods to the County Council, making the point that if
   barriers were removed there would be a loss of calculated
   spectator capacity.   What I am interested in is the Police
   view about that at that time.   Would you go back please for
   that to page 165.   This is the Chief Superintendent writing to
   the County Council on the same subject.   The bottom paragraph
   on that first page, really the last 5 lines:

        "I understand from him" (England, the club's then
        secretary) "that it is being suggested that any
        alterations could conceiveably result in a
        reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane
        terracing.  I am not aware of the thinking
        behind that, but for my part see no reason why
        that should b e " .

   Do you follow the point, that the Police's view when it came
   to the removal of that section of radial back in 1982 was that
   they did not see any reason why that should affect capacity? -
   A. When the radials were put in, yes.

Q. Yes. - A. I can follow the view, yes.

                                                   C. CALVERT



Q. Was it also your view in 1986 there was no reason why likewise
   the removal of 146 should affect the total number who could
   safely be accommodated? - A. I did not particularly consider
   the capacity.

Q. So be it.  When I said 146 I meant 144.  One final question
   only for identification.  There are some drawings in this
   bundle at page 216 which are in the middle of the Eastwood
   drawings but are not Eastwood's . Are they by any chance your
   drawings you could not identify? - A. No, these are not mine.

Q. They are not yours either.  216 to 219.       - A. No, never seen
   these until I read the bundle.

Q. We don't know.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        We will break now.   2 o'clock.
