            I am a P olice               Inspector              in the      South        Yorkshire           Police       and     am

            currently             employed           in    the    Police          Driving       School.

            On Friday,             14 A p r i l       1989,        (140489)         as    instructed,              I attended            a    pre-

            match       briefing          at     Hillsborough               Football           Ground.            The     briefing           took

            place       at    1000       am     and       was    conducted          by C h i e f      Superintendent                  D u c k e n f ield,

            together          with       other        Senior          Officers,          and    was        for    Inspectors           and     above.

            The    briefing             was     adequate          and       seemed       well     prepared.

            At    0930       am    on S a t u r d a y ,         15 A p r i l      1989,     (150489)             I commenced            duty     at

            Hillsborough Football                          Ground,          for    duties        in    relation           to    the    semi

            final       match       which        was       to    be    played       between           Liverpool           and    Nottingham

            Forest.           I was       allocated              Sub Sector           18 w i t h       Serial       45.         I was

            replacing             Inspector           Morton          ’E ' D i v i s i o n .

            My    serials          duties        were       to     be P u b l i c    Order        - Coach          Reception           at

            Tankersley             on    t he    A61       on    the     Sheffield          side       of m o t o r w a y       J u n c t i o n 36.

            We    were       to    check.at           random          coaches       and     mini       buses       carrying           Liverpool

            supporters,             these        duties          to    be    carried        out       in    conjunction with                  Road

            Traffic          Officers.               During        and      after     the      m a t c h we       were     to    remain         in

            the    Tankersley area                    as    a mobile           patrol.           I attended             the     pre-match

            briefing          at     1000       am    that       date,       and    on    checking           my    serial,         found        that

9 Constables                and    a Sergeant.                  We    were        issued        with    a Ford           Transit            van

as    transport,             this        being       registered              number       C 4 1 0 H ET.

The      briefing           was    given        by C h i e f         Superintendent               Duckenfield                and       again

appeared          adequate.               It    followed             th e    general        pattern          of       other

briefings          for       similar           matches          I have        attended           in the          past.           It

appeared          that       Chief        Inspector P u r d y                was    in     command          of    ou r      sector.

After       the    briefing,              we    were      given         a    small        pre-packed meal,                   and       drink,

which       were       consumed           at    the      ground.             Myself       and     the       Sergeant             were

issued with             a    personal           radio.

At    1 1 0 0 am,       we       picked        up our       vehicle           and     went       to T a n k e r s l e y

intersections                where        we    rendezvoused                 with     several          Road       Traffic

Officers.              On    speaking           with      those         officers,           we    were       informed                that

they      had     not       been        briefed        to w o r k       with       o ur    serial,          and       in f a c t       their

order       specifically                 informed         them        that        because        of    traffic           problems            in

-1988,      such       checks           for    1989      had     been        dispensed           w i t h.        This       therefore

l ef t    me    with        11    officers           including              myself.         At     11.20 am            I set          up m y

reception          point          in t h e      lay      by w h i c h        is    situated           on the          Sheffield

side      of    th e    motor           way,    on     the A 6 1        approach           road.

I pre-briefed                my     serial        to     randomly            check        coaches       and       mini-buses,                as

per      the    order,           no t    to    enter      vehicles            unless        there       were          4 or       5    of    them

together,          in th e          event       of     trouble          on a n y      vehicle.              I instructed                   them

to    check       persons           for       dr in k,    drunken            condition,           and       the       possession             of

the      correct        entry           ticket,        and any          problems           to    be    referred             to       either

the      Sergeant           or    myself.

It    quicky       became          apparent            t ha t    t he       personal        radios          were       of    no       use

whatsoever,             due       to     our     location and                distance           from    the       ground.              The

van      contained           a Force           radio,       bu t      our     radio        call       sign       as    issued          was

India       18 on       personal              radio.

At    the      outset,           traffic         travelling             towards           Sheffield          was       only

moderately             light,           with    the m a j o r i t y          of    vehicles           being       private             cars.

                                                                                                                                              R408

Almost        al l    the       c ar s      were      displaying                colours           associating                 them       with

Liverpool            Football             Club.           As    time       went        on,      traffic            became          very       h ea v y ,

and    there         were       periods           where         traffic             was    in f a c t         at    a    standstill,

backing        up     from          the     traffic            island          at    the       new S t o c k s b r i d g e          by-pass.

Between        11.20 am and                  2.30         pm    (1430)          we     checked           53     vehicles,              being        a

mixture        of     coaches             and     mini         buses.           On     the      coaches            checked          there          were

no    drinks         found          and     only      7    persons             were       found         to    have       no    tickets.

Due    to     ou r    location,              and      th e      fact        t h at     those        7    persons          were         amongst

organised            groups,           it    seemed            impractical                to    prevent            them       continuing

their        journey,           but       they     were         suitably advised.                            They       all    hoped          to

purchase         tickets             from       touts.              In    the       mini       buses         checked,          so      f ar    as       we

could        ascertain              it a p p e a r e d         that       persons          were         in    possession               of     the

correct        appropriate                  tickets.                On    some       of    the     mini         buses         c a ns     of

drinks        were        located.              These          were       few       in n u m b e r ,         and    after          the

occupants            had       been       strongly             advised,             the    drinks            were       surrendered.

The    contents            were        poured         away,          and       the     empty        c an s      collected              and

deposited            in t he         waste        container               at C l a y w h e e l s         Lane       Garage.              None       of

the    persons            on    the       coaches,             or    in     the      mini       buses         were       under         the

influence            of    drink          and     there         were       no       problems            whatsoever             with         their

behaviour.                The       occupants             were       obviously             in h i g h         spirits,             but      what        I

would        consider           normal          for       persons          attending              this        type       of    function.

During        the w h o l e          of     the    time         we w e r e          checking            vehicles,             we    had       no

problems,            and       so    far     as    I was            concerned             all     vehicles              leaving          our

location were                  in o r d e r .

We    had     occasions              to s t o p       several             coaches          which         were       displaying                signs

to    th e    front        which          showed          'Nottingham                Forest*,            b ut      these       turned          out          to

many        of     th e    coaches            had       been    searched              by    the        Police         in L i v e r p o o l

prior         to    departure.

At     2.15        pm     (1 41 5)       traffic          was     almost          non       existent,               and     except           for       2

coaches            which          arrived         together            at    about          2.30        pm we        checked            no    other

coaches            or m i n i       buses         for      quite       some       time.            The       reason         given           by    the

drivers            for     these         l a st     2    coaches           for    being           so    late       was      that          they     had

decided            to     travel         towards          Sheffield              via       th e    M56       intending               missing           as

much        traffic           as    possible             on    the     M62,       but       had        instead           ru n     i n to     heavy

traffic            at     roadworks            in th e         Manchester               area       of       t he    M56.

After         these        t wo     coaches             left,     we       checked          no     other           vehicles.

During           the      time      we    were          operating           at    Tankersley                 nothing            whatsoever

was     received              by    personal             ra d i o .        On    t he      vans        VHF     ra di o,         it     sounded             as

though           there        was       difficulty             being        experienced                 with        traffic            in    the

City        ar e a .      This          fact      was     confirmed              by     visiting             Traffic            Officers,              who

felt        we     ha d    been         lucky       to    have        been       selected              to    cover         th e      point        we

had,        instead           of    at    the       Nottingham              Forest          side        of     t he      ground.

My     serial           had       been    detailed             during           Phase       2     to m e a l        at     Claywheels

Lane,         then        return         to    the       Tankersley              area.            In    view        of     the       fact        that

traffic            was     non-existent,                  at    2.55        pm    (1455)           I stood            my    serial           down and

we     began        to m a k e          our    way       to C l a y w h e e l s         Lane.

As     we     travelled             down Halifax                Road,           for     the       first        time,        we       heard

messages            on     the      personal             radio.            These        tended          to     indicate              that        things

around           the      ground         were       b u sy ,    but        nothing          more.            As    we      turned           round

th e    traffic            island         at      the     bottom           of    Leppings              Lane,        I was         surprised                to

still         see       lots       of    fans       making        their          way       to     the       ground,         even          though           it

was     now        past       3    pm    (1500)          the    kick        off       time.

We     a r r i v e d at           Claywheels             Lane     at       about        3.05       pm       (1505)          As       we     turned

from Penistone                     Road       towards          the P o l i c e          Garage,             I saw C h i e f            Inspector

PURDY,       I    informed              him       of m y      intention              to m e a l ,         an d    then     attended           at

the    Garage          forecourt.                 On    arrival           at      Claywheels              Lane,      my     serial       was

briefed          to m e a l           as     a group, ready                for       future          deployment.                  In   the m a i n

I expected             this           to     be    a f t e r the     match           had       en de d.

Whilst       at       the       Police        Garage,          I used             the     toilets,           and     then       went     to    the

mobile       canteen             to     collect          my    ho t      meal.           After       being        served        with     the

meal,       I began             walking           back     towards             the       entrance           in to    Claywheels             Lane

garage,          and       at    this        point,        was      met        by    my    serial           leaving         the    garage.

They    indicated                to me        that       we    were          to     attend        at      the     Leppings         Lane       end

of    the    ground             as    t h e re     was     some         kind        of    a problem.              After        depositing

my m e a l       on    a    table,           I rejoined             my     serial.              We     attended           near     the

Leppings          Lane          entrance           to    Hillsborough.                    The     time       would        now     be    about

3.15    pm       (1515 )•

On    initially             attending              this       point,           I saw       th at       Officers           were     forming          a

cordon       across             the     access          area       to    the        ground.          The     only        Senior

Officers          in       the        areaa p p e a r e d      to       be       other     Inspectors.                    Ia s k e d    them

what    was       wrong,              n o n e s e e m e d to        know,         but      that        we    were        to p r e v e n t

further          access          to     the       ground       by       supporters.                  I therefore               left     one    of

my    officers             with       ou r    vehicle          to       protect           it,     or m o v e        it    as    necessary,

and    deployed             the       remainder            of m y        serial,           with        the       other     officers

already          forming             the     cordon.          The       traffic           on     the    personal           radio       was

such    that          it    was       impossible              to    get        air       time     to      clarify         from     ground

control          either          what        the       problem          w as ,      or    if    they        wished        my    serial

deploying             elsewhere.

Although          the       time       was        now    past       3-15pm           (1515)          there        were     still        a number

of    supporters                making        their        way      to     the       ground,           and       obviously         they       were

upset       at    not       being          allowed         access          on       the    production               of    their        tickets.

Eventually,                I picked           up       a message           that          ambulances              were     attending           and

realised          that          someone           must     have         been        injured.            On       looking        down     the
small       road w h i c h       runs       alongside             the       football             ground          I saw      that        t h * re

appeared        to    be    s o m e t h i ng       happening            near          to    a    large        access        y a te,      but

from    my    pas i t i o n      could          not    tell       what       it w a s .            I l ef t       my     serial         in

position whilst                 I made          way    to    t h at     area?          firstly           to      try     to a s c e r t a i n

what    was     happening             and       secondly          to    s ee k        a Senior           Officer          to     see     if w e

were     required          elsewhere.

On    entering        the       large       access          g a t e , I saw            a    large        nurtibe r of          injured

persons        lying       around          on    the    ground          in t h e           triangular             area      to     the       r e ar

of    the    Leppings           Lane       stand.           Some       were       being          given        mouth       to rfiouth

resuscitation,,             others          cardiac:         compression.                       Others        were       being

treated         for       other       problems.               I also         found           c l o s e to     the      gate      the      body,

of    a male     who       was       obviously          dead,           I    returned              to m y     serial         and

instructed           them       to    go    into       the       area       previously              described             and      give

what     help    they       could.              1 made       my w a y        further             into       the     a r e a , still                    I

trying       to a s s e s s      what       had       occurred.              During             this time         3 ambulances

had arrived           behind          m e , n ear       to       the    large          g a t e , and          some       injured

persons        were       being       moved        towards            them       by    either          police          officers           or           I

the    injured        persons          friends,                                                                                                        !

It was       during        this       time       that       1 met       Superintendent                      Marshall.              He

instructed           me    to    fetch          the a m b u l a n c e s          to    the       rear       of    the      stand        as       th<

were     needed.           On    c h e cfci n g , I f o u n d           that          the       ambulances             were      too      high

to    gain a c c e s s      to       the    ground          a r ea ,    this          being        due      to    the      large        metal

bars    which        stretched             across       the       top       of    the       large        access          g a te,    and

which       carry     the       running          gear       for       the    sliding             gates,           I considered                   tt

to    be a point, w h i c h            required             future          consideration                   as    it w a s

impossible           to    take       the       emergency             vehicles             i nto    the       ground        area.            I

searched        out       Superintendent                Harshall             and       informed             him     of     the

probIera.        He       then       instructed             me    to    check          if we        could         get     the

ambulances           into       any    other          gates       in    the       area,          and     in a n y        case,      to       hi

breathing        apparatus             brought          up       to    the       r ear      of     the      stand.

                                                                                                                                     R40S

I then       went       to    the        ambulance            nearest        the      gate      and        passed       on    the

message       regarding              the        breathing           apparatus,            and        saw a member             of     th e

vehicles          crew       enter        the     ground           with     such      equipment.                 1 also       saw     that

by    this    time       several              fire     tenders        were         in a t t e n d a n c e ,       and       fire

brigade       officers             were         also     entering           the     ground           carrying          breathing

apparatus.              I then           checked         the       large     gates        in the           immediate          area        and

found    all       to    be       to o    low     to a l l o w a c c e s s ,          fo r     the     same       reason        as

initially          stated.               I again         returned           to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t        Marshall           and

passed       on    this       information.                    He    then     instructed               me    to    begin       moving

injured       persons             out     of     the a r e a        and     towards           th e    ambulances.               I

therefore         went        around            the    area and           arranged            fo r    Police          Officers        and

other    persons who                 were        administering               first        aid,        to    begin       to m o v e        the

injured       persons             towards         th e      access        gate.          As    I walked           around,           I saw

other    dead       persons              lying        in the        area,      covered           by    coats          etc.      Even        at

this    point,          I was        still        not       fully aware             of    what        had     occurred,             but

realised          the    persons              were     suffeirng            crush        injuries.               At    one    point,

whilst       near       the       access         g a te ,     I saw       that      fans       were        preventing           an

ambulance          entering              t he    top     of    the    access          road,          and    made       my    way     to     the

area.        With       others           we     managed        to    g et    t he     ambulance             through          the

supporters.              Also        whilst           in the a r e a ,         b o t h w h i 1st           moving       around

assessing          the       situation,               and     whilst        trying        to a r r a n g e        casualty

evacuation,             I was        abused           on a n u m b e r        of    occasions              by L i v e r p o o l      fans.

I was    pulled          and       pushed         about        and    on m a n y         occasions            it w a s       pointed

out    to me       quite          forcibly            that     I was        a murderer.                The       language           being

uses    was       some       of    the        most     foul        I have      heard.            It    seemed          to m e       taht

the    abusers          were       suffering             shock,       and      were       relieving              their

frustrations             on me.               I could         see    little         point        in t a k i n g        their        actions

further,          and    after           trying        to     calm    down         the    various           fans,       left        them     to

make    their       way       ou t       of     the    ground.            Others         were        simply       trying        to

obtain       information,                 none        of w h i c h    I was         able       to     give.

During        this        p h as e ,       t he    obvious            problems          that       occurred          and       which           has

been     highlighted                  since,        was        th e    l ac k     of    stretchers             or    other           means       of

moving        th e       injured           and     dead        persons,           other       than       by    physically

carrying            them       from        t he    scene.

Eventually               things        appeared            to     be    settling           down         and    most       of     the

injured         persons            had      been moved                from      th e    area.           At    this       time,        I went

along        t he    tunnel           which        leads        from        the    rear       of    th e      stand,          onto        the

standing            area       of L e p p i n g s        Lane         terraces,          at     the      centre.              On arriving

at    th e    terracing,               I saw        that        there        were       still       a number             of    persons

wandering            around           on    the     t e r r a c ed area.                I also          saw    that       there           wre

people        on     the       pitch,         some       still         being       given        first         aid,       and    a l s o,

there        wa s    a    l in e      of P o l i c e      Officers              standing           on    the     centre          line

across        the        width        of    the     pitch.             On    looking          elsewhere             around           the

ground        I realised               that        the    Nottingham               Forest          fans       were       just        standing

patiently            around,           and        I was        thankful           that     they         hadn't       decided              to

cause        other        problems.                On    re-entering               the     tunnel,            I was       met        by    two

off    duty         nurses         who      we re       seeking         help.           W h i 1st       speaking          with        these

nurses,         we       were      directed             to a y o u t h          sitting         nearby         who       was

complaining               of    pains         in h i s         ri bs.        The       nurses       took       charge          of     this

person        and        began        to    evacuate            him     to      the a m b u l a n c e s .

I returned               to    th e    area        near        the     access          gate,       where       I met          Inspector

Sykes,        and        a serial           of     Officers.                They       had made          an    enclosure              ou t      of

portable            fencing           and     I saw        that        there       were       several          bodies          covered           up

in    this      enclosure.                  On     querying            the      number,         I was         informed           that          there

were     ten        persons.               The     Liverpool            fans       then       began          leaving          t he    ground

and    I worked               together            with     other        officers           in      directing             them        from       the

ground.

At    this      po in t ,       we     were        joined         by    Inspector             Webster.              He    stated           that

he    was     trying           to a s c e r t a i n        the        number       of    dead       persons          at       o ur    end       of

the    ground.                I was        under        th e    impression              that       the       10 d e a d       persons           were

the       only        fatalities                to    have       occurred,            and      that        the    injured           persons             we

had       removed were                  the       b u lk    of     those       injured.               We    were       informed           that

there          were        over       70     other         persons          dead      in th e         gymnasium,             and        this    was

the       first        time        that         I realised             th e    scale        of      the     incident.

We    were        then        joined            by Dr.       Leigh,           Police        Surgeon.              Superintendent

Marshall              requested              that       he a t t e n d        at    the     gymnasium.                 As    there        was       no

one       else        in th e a r e a             who      knew     the       whereabouts              of    the       gym,        or    the

route,          I took           him       to     that      location.               I left          him     at    the       entrance           to

the       gym with            other          officers            and    began        making           my    way       back       towards        the

Leppings              Lane       end       of     the      ground.            I saw       that        by    this       time,        the

terraced              area       was       almost          clear       and     decided           to    sue       that       as     the    easiest

return          route.             On      crossing           the      football           pitch        I saw          that       there     were

very       few        persons,             other        than Po li ce              Officers,           still          on    th e    pitch.

On    arriving              back        at      the     Leppings            Lane      end      of     the    ground,             I located              my

serial,           still          assisting              with       ground          clearance           of    uninjured              f a ns .        I

noticed           that        the       time         was    now 4 . 4 5        pm     ( 16 4 5 ) .         During          the     whole       of       th i s

time,          th e    radio          had       been       receiving,              bu t   there        was       no    free        air    time          to

pass       messages.

By    5    pm     (1700)           th e      messages            were       talking         about          traffic          problems,

obviously              being          caused          by    the     fans       leaving           the       ground,          made        worse       by

returning              emergency                vehicles.              At     the     Leppings             Lane       area       the     fans       were

now       cl ea r,         and     as      ou r      original          brief        had     been       traffic             patrol        in the

Tankersley                 ar e a ,     I decided             to    resume          to    my     serial          to a s s i s t         with

traffic,              as    possible.

I noted           that        as      we     began         to m o v e       off     in    our       vehicle           the    time        was    in

fact       5    pm     (1700).               We      patrolled          as     best       we     could along                the     A61    between

H il lsb or oug h and Grenoside,                                 but    saw        that     points          were       being        worked.

One       of    the        problems             causing          traffic           hold-ups           was    the       coaches           still

parked          along         Penistone               Road/Halifax                 Road,       and     obviously             waiting           to

pick       up t h e i r          passengers.                .These          vehicles           caused        problems              throughout.

          We    continued            to     patrol,           and     attended           an       incident          reported           as    Police

          Officers           in    trouble           n e ar     the      supermarkets               in H a l i f a x        Road,       but

          nothing       was        found.            Due      to     the    amount           of    traffic          on    the     radio       it w a s

          still       no t    possible              to    pass       messages           to    control.

          By    6.30     pm       (1 8 3 0 )    the       A61      towards        Tankersley              w as      almost        clear.           as    we

          travelled           down        towards          Hillsborough,                 I noticed             a gap        in a i r        traffic

          and    for    the        first        time       managed          to    contact           control.              I explained              the

          road    conditions                and      asked         for     instructions.                  We     were       instructed             to

          continue           patrol         for      the      time         be i n g .        D u e to th e       fact that         we       had     no t

          had    anything            to     eat      or    drink           since        10.30 am I instructed                     my        driver       to

          attend       at     Claywheels                 Lane      Garage        with        the    hope       of     obtaining

          refreshments               f or      my    serial.

          Again,       they were               instructed             to    remain           together          until        instructions

          were    confirmed.                   At    7.15       pm    (1915)          I was        instructed            to      stand       down       my

          serial,       b ut       to     remain available                   myself           until       instructed              otherwise.

          At    Claywheels              Lane,        I could          find       no    one        who    appeared           to    be    collecting

          debriefing              forms,        radios          or    other       paperwork,              but       realised           this       was

          due    to    the        operation              still       in a c t i o n     at        the    ground.            At   7.30        pm    I ws

          joined       by     Inspector              Sykes         who     informed           me    that       we     had      now all        been

          stood       down.          I went          off      duty       at 7 . 4 5      pm       that    dat e .                  * '

          deceased.               Prior        to    leaving, I made              certain                that       hi s w h e r e a b o u t s      were

          noted,       and        made      provision              arrangements               for       his    transport           back       to     *A'
