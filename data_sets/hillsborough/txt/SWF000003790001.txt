Mr     Collins' opening statement continues to a page number which
unfortunately did not come out on the copy before me.


Mr     Hytner addressed the inquiry from which it became   apparent
that    he is instructed by Solicitors on behalf of the    berieved
or injured and there was discussion as to the order in       which
Counsel should examine witnesses.

 Witness : Stephen Martin Foster - DAC Volniru* 1
 Monday 15th May 1989 After-norm


 Examined by Mr Goldsack.


 Foster is Detective Constable in the Merseyside Police.


 Foster is a Liverpool supporter and attended Sheffield on                        the
 15th April.


Foster attended with his younger brother 19 years of age having
driven        to     Sheffield, walked to the ground ariving at            2.45pm.
They set off at 11.00 am but were delayed for 55 minutes on the
exit     of        the M63 and approached Leppings Lane          along    Straight
Hill.        At     the   time    of     his arrival the   scene    was    one     of
thousands of people outside the turnstiles, and one of complete



He estimated 4,000 - 5,000 people.


He     saw    uniformed        foot Police behind     barriers     blocking       off
terraced streets and main junctions whilst approaching Leppings
Lane,     but there were no foot personnel regulating people until
he reached the Merseyside mounted Officers at the turnstiles.


He saw no foot Police Officers near the turnstiles.


He     saw two mounted Officers in the gateway which is the                     outer
perimeter          railings     50 yards in front of the gate A - and            two
further        mounted        Officers    between   that   position       and    the
turnstiles facing the outer perimeter fence, ie A-G.


The    perimeter gates were open, but once he had got beyond                     the
two outer Officers on horses efforts were made to                        close the
gate behind him, and the horses.


With    his        brother    he went down the inside of the        brick       wall
                                              -   4 -


 whxch       then goes onto a corrigated steel wall just near to                      the
 turnstiles,             the pressure was increasing all the itme, and                the
 mounted         Police Officers did not appear to have any success                    in
 bringing          any    order    to    the situation, they       were    trying      to
control the crowd by movement of the horses, and verbally,                           but
without success.


 It    was       about 4 or 5 minutes from the time that I was                at     the
back        of the crowd to the time that I got to the turnstile, the
innermost turnstile next to the steel corrigated wall.


There was great difficulty getting through the turnstile but I
handed over my ticket as I went through.


As     I     got     through      the turnstile I       saw   a   uniformed   Police
Inspector behind the turnstile and I produced my Police Warrant
Card to him and told him that in my opinion there was a serious
risk        to     life outside.        He said "I will try and sort it           o u t ”.
At that time the large cantilever gate was closed.


I do not know whether the Inspector had a radio.


I     was frightened of the crush and very frightened outside that
turnstile,          people were fainting and were unable to fall                  down,
they        had no choice but to be pressed on towards the turnstile.
People were trying to gain access to the ground by other routes
and     I    assisted       people      to   climb the    large    wall,    and     the
stainless          steel corigated wall directly between 1-60 and                  A-G.
Their       only     reason for climbing was to escape the crush in                  my
opinion,  and I saw no evidence of disorder, public disorder or
drunkeness outside those turnstiles.


At    that point I could see directly the tunnel entrance but                        my
brother and I went to the urinals to the left of that entrance,
when we came out people were entering the ground through                           the
large concertina gate at the bottom.
                                              -   5 -


 At that point I was aware that the game was due to start and my
 brother and I made our way into the tunnel.                           People were coining
 through       the       concertina       gates    in a    normal       walking        manner,
 however^ as         one.        They were not running or              being    disorderly.
 They were not     shepherded in anyway                    through       that        gate     by
 stewards or Police.


When        I got to the end of the tunnel it appeared to be                          blocked
with     people who were on the terracing.                      I got out of the right
 hand       side    of the tunnel onto Unit 3 or pen 3.                   I     was    pushed
 along diagonally down to the right from the tunnel in pen 3.


The     crowd       was         completely congested and          at    that time            the
Liverpool          team     came out onto the pitch and the                crowd       became
excxted.        The crowd was swaying and excited.


At     a time when both teams had come out onto the pitch and                                the
game     had commenced I l o o W b a c k and right up behind me I                          could
see     that       the     only^ through to the less congested                  pen    was     a
gateway        which       was     right at the back and at the                top    of     the
terracing          which        was a door 3 feet.       I was however          unable        to
move    through           the    crowd to that gateway, but when                it     became
apparent       that        something      was the matter by about              3.20     pm     I
managed       very        slowly    to move   back and           out      onto the          less
congested          wing     1    and 2.    I was in pen 3        for     about 20       -     25
minutes continually being moved about.                     I was hot aware of what
was happening at the front of pen 3, I thought it was a typical
semi final atmosphere.


I    could     see the pitch but not the game in progress but I                             was
aware that the playes had gone off the pitch.


As    the     minutes went by I           and those        around mebecame aware              of
the seriousness             of the situation.           I saw    thedeceased            being
passed out.


From my position in pen 3 I was able to see the small perimeter
                                          -   6 -


 fence        gate.    There were uniformed Police Officers at that gate
 and     I     did not see it opened until minutes later.             It did       not
 stay open and I could see supporters being pushed back into the
 stadium back onto the terracing.               Supporters were attempting to
 clamber        out    through the gate but were being pushed back.                 It
 was     my     impression that the Officers on duty had not               realised
 the     serxousness of tte^situa^on as quickly as the supporters.
 I     can only recall seeing^at the small gate to the pitch, but I
 thxnk that there were one or two others doing what is normal


 I recall perhaps that at 3.10 pm having noticed the gate at the
top of the terrace that I was unable to reach that gate due to
people still arriving from the back.


At pen 2 there were open spaces for me to walk into, it was not
nearly so ftfll as pen 3.


The copy of the transcript that I am working from appears to go
alittle a stray here. The page numbers have not been produced.
Foster however is still giving evidence.


The previous year approaching the ground at a big open junction
there        were     a lot of ,       tincl uniformed foot patrols     deployed
attempting          to get people to enter the ground early.           This year
he     says     he saw Police behind barriers at the terraced               roads,
but     not     in the same numbers and at no time did he see               anyone
requested        to    make    their   way down the Lepping    Lane        to     the
ground.


Again     the       previous   year    before he could get    to   the          outer
perimeter        railings, that i£ before A-G, 50 yards before               those^
there     was a unit of uniformed foot personnel examining tickets
and     filtering       people into queues, with mounted officers               near
the     turnstiles.        This year he did not see anything          of    this.
The first barrier he came to                  the mounted Police Officers.


The previous year those without tickets were being turned away.
                                               -   7 -




    The previous year when going through the tunnel he saw stewards
 at     the far end on the pitch side of the tunnel advising people
 to     move along those gangways which are at the base of the West
 stand to            use the gaps in the railings.                 This year he did        not
 see any.


 Foster        told the inquiry that this year when he was approaching
 the     ground        there was a stream of people going                  down     Leppings
 Lane.        There was congestion on the roadway, mass chaotfs, there
 was just conjestion everywhere.                   Outside the ground between the
 turnstiles and the paved area there was a solid mass of people.
         down from the roundabout towards the turnstiles                                 there
wfts still thousands of people arriving.


It     took        me about 10 minutes getting from the outer                      perimeter
raxlings           where     the     two first mounted Officers             were    to     the
turnstyle.            Prior to that it had only taken me about 2 minutes
to     get     from        the     outer limits of the mass           on    Lepping      Lane
through        to     the        outer   railings.       I was     surprised ^ a t        how
shorty         a time it took me and I put this down to the fact that
I was moving along a wall and I was not in the most                               congested
part of it.


I     could not^see that the two mounted police positioned outside
the railings ra* s a v i n g any beneficial purpose.                        Neither could
I     see     that     th^police hggSKFs within the enclosed                    area     were
servxng        a     useful       purpose since they appeared              to   have     lost
control.           I do not think they had been trapped in that position
by     the     crowd,       I     think they had         allowed    the     situation      to
develop.           I did not see any foot personnel (police) within the
xnner        raxlxng       barrier       to the turnstyles,         only    the     mounted
°“ lcers‘   The only foot personnel I did see on Leppings Lane
wars standing in two's and three's behind the barriers on the
dwellings side.             Those Officers were presumably stopping peopel
crashing       through the side roads but there was certainly no one
regulating or controlling the crowd at the turnstyles at all.
                                              -   8 -




 I think there were groups of two or three Officers stood at the
 junctions at the top of Leppings Lane.


 The     previous         year   there     have been a lot       of    foot     Officers
 deployed along Lepping Road moving people on and trying to get
 them into the ground early.


 Foster       was asked if he would have arrived or would attempt                         to
 arrive       at    the     ground      earlier if there       had    been    pre-match
 entertainment.             He   told    the inquiry that he thought            he       had
 given        himself        plenty      of   time      even    without        prematch
 entertainment            to arrive.     He had allowed himself 3 - 3 %              hours
to      get there and had arrived at the top of the hill at quarter
past     2.        Foster's general attitude was that when going                    to    a
football       match his intention is to get into the ground and get
positioned         in the ground early without leaving it to the                      last
niinute notwithstanding prematch entertainment.


Foster     was shown a photograph of the "gate" opening into pen 2
which     clearly showed that there was a gate at that point.                         His
evidence was that he had not seen the opening as a gate and did
not     have to open anything when he went through so he made                         the
assumption that at all the time that he looked at that                              area,
the gate was open.


The     previous      year       when Foster attended he went into              pen      4,
arrived       at    about 2.30 pm, the pens at that time                were     pretty
well     filled      to capacity but the previous year on                   arrival      he
remembered         that     stewards were there to advise.             He    made     the
point     however that even when stewards give advice some                      people
do still make to behind the goal areas traditionally.


At page 74 Foster gave his route from St Helens to the                          ground
under cross examination by Mr Jackson.


Under    cross       examination        by Mr Woodward^ Foster        gave     further
                                             -    9 -


 evidence as to his approach to the ground on the previous year.


 Foster        looked at photographs 20A, 21A, 22 and 23, and told the
 inquiry        that       the     photographs showed the situation                in     1988,
 although he thought there were more Police Offices than                                   were
 shown in the photographs present.


 Foster        looked       at photographs 20, 21, 22 and 23 and                   told     the
 inquiry        that        the    photographs      showed     the       sort     of     Police
 arrangements that he had seen in 1988 with the supporters being
 kept     in    a        controled manner.        At page 76     the       question        from
Woodward            of    Counsel,     at   76A     appears    to        imply    that      the
photographs being looked at were taken in 1989, and the witness
agreed     that the photograph showed a number of foot Officers in
uniform        in addition to the mounted Officers gently                        controling
and directing the crowd. The timing of the                              photographs       t o m
14.26, 14.27, 14.28 and 14.29.


Under     cross          examination     by Mr Woodward        the       witness        Foster
showed     that he had approached the ground with a steady flow of
people     in 1989 much as he had experienced in 1988.                           He came to
a    conjested crowd at a point beyond the paving before Leppings
Lane.      There          was conjestion but the people were                not        pushing
anywhere.        He said he was not pushing.                Everybody wanted to get
into     the ground for 3.00 o'clock.                   He agreed that he with             the
others were "moving urgently to your destination".


Foster     said          that he made his progress along the wall, and                      he
assisted        people up onto the wall who were being crushed and it
was partly by assisting people up onto the wall that he                                  found
that he had made progress.


Foster     said          under     cross examination that when             he     left     the
urinal there was space behind the turnstiles compared with what
he     had experienced on the other side, there was no                           conjestion
there, no problem or disorder outside the turnstiles, and there
were    people           sitting    on the floor that         side/ the          turnstiles
                                                                    M
                                            -   10 -


 recovering         from    the crush and people assisting them.                     Foster
walked        down the tunnel towards the front of a ground that                        had
come through a gate.      (NHB does not know                      which       gate     this
witness is referring to at page 80).


Foster        did     not   see     any     officials or     stewards,         and      his
recollection          is that the people who came through the gates did
not      appear      shepherded      in anyway, there was just            a     flow     of
Liverpool         supporters coming         through    the   gate    towards            the
tunnel.   (NHB thinks that at page 80 he is referring                           to      the
gate which was opened by the Police).


Foster had felt in more danger on the outside of the turnstiles
when he thought there was a risk to life, than when he had gone
through the tunnel.            Foster did not see any steward or official
at the other end of the tunnel, and he finished up at the right
hand     side      but did not purposely go int hat direction.                       Under
cross examination by Mr Glasgow Foster said that he did not see
the     opening of "the gate" as he was aware of people coming                          as
one through that gate towards a direct line to the tunnel.


He     said      that he was propelled involuntarily and did not                      know
how    he     came    to get      to the   right hand side of the         tunnel        to
finish up, it was not             of his   choice, in pen    3.


Foster finished by saying under cross examination by Mr Glasgow
that     if he had not been under pressure from the people                          behind
him he could have go^into w h a t e v e r pen he wanted to.


Foster      was re-examined by Mr Collins when he said that he                         was
amazed      at    the pictures that had been shown to him                 as        having
been     taken at 2.26 - 2.28 as he saw no signs of foot personnel
anywhere near the Leppings Lane turnstiles. That is at 2.45 pm
when I got there.


Foster      did not hear any announcements over a tannoy system                         or
from     Police      loud   hailers outside the ground,             and       the    only
                                    -   11 -


    message   he   heard was "will the supporters please get back   on
    the terracing".   That was at 3.20 pm.

         Michael Joseph Bradley
         Afternoon session of Monday 15th Mav 1989
\
         Commencing at page 86 of the transcript.


        Michael Joseph Bradley lives in Fairfields, Liverpool.                          He is a
        British         Telecom Engineer.          He is 24 years of age and he had. in
        the past taken part in a one week St Johns Ambulance course. At
        the      time of the football match in question he had about 1 years
        experience in            first      aid.     He bought a ticket for           the    match
        from a friend.


    ;   He      went to the match by trian from Manchester to Sheffield                         on
        the      1.00    o'clock trial which was an ordinary train but                      there
        were        stewards     on board and Police stopping            anyone       drinking.
        Some        people     were    thrown      off the train for         having    cans     of
        alcohol on the train and they were ordered to leave so they did
        not get to the match.


        I     had     attended       the    same semi final the        year    before.        The
        previous        year I had attended by car.             I was with two         friends.
        We were walking from the railway station when we saw a taxi and
        we     asked     the    driver      to take us as        far    as     he     could    to
        Hillsborough.          After 5 or 6 minutes the driver,told us he could
        not     get     any further because of Police cars and                 traffic.        We
        were     just     by the park when we got out.            Just by       Hillsborough
        park.       Just along the road from the football ground.                     We walked
        along       the road with the football ground on the right.                    We were
        walking       down     Middlewood Road.          We carried on down         there     and
        then     at the junction of Leppings Lane we carried on down                         that
        part.        There were alot of football supporters walking that way
        stretching across the raod, I could not tell who they supported
        because both teams wear red.


        As I walked along I saw a few Policemen on the side streets but
        not     nearly       as many as last year.          I think the time was            about
        2*30,       although     I    did   not have a watch with me            when    I     was
                                              -   13 -


walking           along     that part of the road.         I was aiming to get             to
 the       ground         for 2.30 pm.My two friends           had    stand        tickets
whereas           I only had a ground ticket so we parted well before                          I
 got       to the turnstiles.            I think the turnstile ticket I had was
 free.           I could not see which turnstile I wanted because                       there
was        alot of people around the turnstiles but not in a definate
queue.           There were thousands of people between the road itself
and        the    outer     gates    to the ground.        I    could      not    see     the
turnstiles           at all.       I could see the letters above but not                  the
turnstiles.               It was like      a solid wall of people.            I can     only
remember          seeing two Policemen on horseback who were before the
turnstiles, maybe 60 yards before hand one either side.


I     remember       seeing 2 or 3 Policemen, but this was well                       before
the turnstiles.             They did not appear to be doing anything, they
were       just standing.          Outside the turnstiles there was a                  solid
mass       of people who appeared to be moving very slowly and so                          I
joined       onto        it to try to get in.        I headed for the            turnstile
letter       B.     I was making for B at first but then I seemed to be
being pushed to the right hand side.                     I just had to go with the
flow.


As     I    was     being carried to the right past                  the   turnstiles      I
thought          there     would    be    more turnstiles        further      round      but
suddenly          before     I new it I was actuaJij inside the ground                  area
between          the turnstile and the tunnel.            I only knew that I             had
been       carried through an opening, and I thought there would                          be
some       more turnstiles further on.              I had my ticket in my pocket
ready       to produce but I found myself inside the ground                       without
having       gone     through       a turnstile, and without having               had     my
ticket       torn.         I still had my complete ticket after the                   match
which I gave to the West Midlands Police Officers who called to
see    me at home.           I did not see the gate open, I just ended                    up
going through it through no choice of my own.                         Nobody around me
was    running,that was impossible it was                  like a shuffle.            I did
not    observe            any stewards     that I could recognise.            I    expect
stewards         to wear their jackets.           I saw no stewards outside the
                                            -   14 -


 ground.           I     saw no stewards inside the ground.           I did not        see
 any     Policemen           before the tunnel.        I went through     the       tunnel
 because that is where everyone else was heading.                       There were so
 many       people going that way that I had no choice but to go with
 them.   There was no signpost inside the ground by the                             tunnel
 saying that there was any other way into the ground.


 I    was       not trying to get immediately behind the              goals.         Last
year I had a good view from a wing section.                    Last year I was in
1 and 2 .


Last        year when we went through the tunnel a steward at the top
of     the tunnel told us to go along the back wall underneath the
stand through an opening and into the other section, which                             we
did not mind doing because there was no room.


As     I went down the tunnel I could see the pitch over                       people's
heads        but I could not see any players on the pitch.                    Because I
went        along the tunnel I was along the left hand side, and                      was
carried into pen 4.               As I got out of the tunnel there was surge
and     I       ended up about 2 yards away from the            perimeter        fence.
In that position, although I thought things would ease off with
there       being        a    sway,   in fact it   just     getting     tighter       and
tighter.          I thought I was going to pass out because I could not
breathe          Everytime I breathed out then the people behind seemed
to     be getting more and more tightly packed.                 I had pressure on
my     shoulder          from    someone who was next to us, I          was     getting
twisted                  waY round, I could not move my arms because                 they
were     jamed to my side, it was just like a constant pressure on
my     chest getting tighter and tighter.                 Everyone around me          was
getting          crushed.        Someone started shouting "get          back",       "get
back"       to     the       people obviously behind us, and       then       everyone
around          us took up shouting "get back" to the people behind.                    I
could see beyond the perimeter fence to the pitch.                       I could see
maybe       a     Policeman every three or four yards just standing                    on
the     track       looking      into the crowd.       We were shouting        to    the
Police       to    open the gate although we did not even               know     where
                                                -    15 -


 there     was a gate but presumed there must have'been one, and we
 were     shouting             for    them to open it to r e l i v e      the    pressure.
 There was no response.                   They were just staring blankly at               the
 crowd.


 By     this        time the team were on the pitch and the match was                      in
 progress.           I do not know how long it went on like that, and the
 Police        on the track did not seem to do anything right the                        way
 through until the team was well off the pitch, and the pressure
 seemed       to        ease    back behind.         I could not see a gate        in    the
 perimeter          from       where I was.         Eventually the pressure       relaxed
 from     behind and then all I could see was the fence and a                           pile
of      bodies between# he ground and maybe, I do not know, four or
five      feet          upwards a solid wall of bodies just              laying       there.
This was in pen 4.                   Another supporter standing by me pulled one
of the lads who was at the top of the pile off the pile and put
him in a                space that was created.             I check to see if     he     was
breathing.


The space that we put him in was on the terracing side.


I found a pulse in his neck and told the supporter I had helped
to     stay with him.                I turned round and saw a hand moving two or
three     bodies          down the pile, so I grabbed another lad who                    was
standing           by    us to give me help and we tried to free him.                     We
were able to pull that person free.                         We laid him down and tried
to give first aid, or mouth to mouth resuscitation.                              By     this
time there was sufficient space to do this.


While     I        was helping someone a St Johns Ambulanceman asked                      me
whether        he       was    ok     and I told him I did         not   think    he    was
breathing           and a few of the supporters carried that person                     out
onto the pitch, so I followed them.                         I presume I went through a
gate     onto the pitch from terrace 4, but I am not too sure,                            it
might     have          been    the one in three if there was a gap               at    the
bottom,        I    do not know.          As I went onto the pitch a            Policeman
tried     to stop me getting onto the pitch and I told him I was a
                                         -   16 -


 first aider, and he let us on.


 I     gave    resuscitation       to someone lying on the       pitch      and     he
 appeared       to recover and he was taken towards the Leppings Lane
 end     to the left hand side of the goal mouth.              There were         alot
 of bodies about the pitch with people in unifprm,                    supporters,
 just ordinary people giving first aid.


 I    was     trying     to resuscitate one person without success                 and
 screamed      at     a Police Officer to get oxygen, but            the    Officer
 said       there     was none".    A fireman in yellow leggings            arrived
put an oxygen mask over his face and carried him away.


NHB note     witness continues concerning his assistance to the
injured supporters.


Bradley       was     cross   examined by Mr Hytner as         to whether         the
previous       year the steward actually told me that his ticket was
marked        with the pen that he should have been in. Bradley                   was
sure     that the stewards had said that he was in the wrong                  pen,
and     directed him elsewhere.         Bradley qualified this by           saying
that he did not know whether they were being moved because the
pens were full.


Bradley had his previous years ticket with                     him   and    having
checked this it proved to show no pen number.


Bradley       wascross    examined by Mr Jackson whom he             told   that
there were no signs at Sheffield railway                   station     directing
people to the ground.


Neither Mr Muller nor Mr Maxwell had any questions.


Bradley was then cross examined by Mr Woodward.


Woodward       took    Bradley     through his      evidence   concerning      his
arrival       at the ground at about 2.30, getting through the gate,
                                           -   17 -


 whether           there was a crush through the gate, the amount of room
 there        was    to     walk inside, and up the   tunnel     (Lord       Justice
 Taylor drew attention               to   the fact that there    was     a    video
 showing this).


 Bradley's          evidence in cross examination bore out his           evidence
 in     chief, but established that he was already getting                  crushed
 when        the    players came onto the pitch and to that end, but              it
 just got worse.             It was a gradual increase of pressure.


 Bradley was cross examined by Mr Glasgow.


 Bradley's          evidence    was consistent with his evidence in           chief
 but    Glasgow said that the witness did not specifically want to
 go$ in any other direction from that which he was being carried
out because there were no directions to say where you could go.
The     witness        at    page 105 said that there might have         been    an
opportunity           for    a steward or a Policeman or somebody else           to
talk     to individuals and direct them in a particular direction,
at the time he had come out of the tunnel if there had been one
there, but there was not one there.


Again on page 105 at F Glasgow suggested to the witness that no
directions           that    could   have been given could     have    made     the
slightest           difference to the direction in which you were             being
forced.        The witness answered "if there had been a space at the
back     between where the end step is there must be like a                  three
foot gap between there and the wall.                   If    there     had    been
somebody standing there ..... "


Glasgow        picked       up on the three foot gap between the back           and
the     wall and the witness said that the supporters were all the
way     up     the steps and on this flat part right up to            the     wall
where        the stand was, so there was no room for a steward               there
anyway,        but     if there had been one there and he had         said      "go
this way or that way" I do not know whether or not I would have
been    able to.          If he had got hold of my arm and pulled us out,
                                      -   18 -

    ye s .


    At     the top of 106 Glasgow established that "the situation that
    presented      you when you came out of the tunnel was a total mass
    when     you   could not have moved vuluntarily either because   you
    wanted to or because somebody had sent        you."    The   witness

 WILLIAM PETER JACKSON - CONTAINED IN VQT,IJME 1 OF
 DEPOSITION FILES


 During         the        afternoon    session      of    Monday     15th       May         1989
 commencing at page 107 examined in chief by Mr Collins.


 Peter        William Jackson is a solicitor and a partner in the firm
 of     Hill        Dickinson & Co who are the solicitors                  instructed          on
 behalf        of    the     Football Supporters Association.                   Jackson        is
 Vice   Chairman of the                 Merseyside        Branch     of    the       Football
 Supporters Association.


 He    is     a season ticket holder for the main stand                     at       Anfield,
Liverpool           supporter     and attended the semi-final on                  the     15th
April and had attended the semi-final the previous year.

He     attended        with                 Chairman of the Football
S u p p o r t e r s Association, Peter Garrett, his brother-in-law and
________________ they all had tickets for the north stand. They
 left Hough Green about 10.45 a.m. by car and were held up on
the M63 for about 45 minutes.


Jackson        gave evidence about his journey and the fact that they
parked        about     10 minutes away from the ground and visited                          the
Freemasons           Arms,    a   pubwhich        this    year     was     only       letting
Liverpool           supporters    in.       There was a bouncer on              the     door.
People        were     noisy, singing but         nobody appeared to            be     drunk.
Jackson had two pints of larger. They left the pub                                   about     2
p.m. and took about 10 minutes to walk to the ground.


He     with     his friends came down Middlewood Road.                     He    said        the
ground         outside       seemed    to    be   very     crowded        and    what         he
particularly          noticed     was that unlike the previous year                     there
was    no outer cordon of Police Officers checking tickets.                              This
year     he could see no orderly queuing there was just a mass                                of
people      trying to get to the turnstyles which were turnstyles A
and    C.      At 2.15 p.m. there was probably a crowd                     30-35        yards
                                                -   20 -


thick        from        the turnstyles.        He recalls only getting into                 the
ground        at approximately 2.55 p.m.                   He heard a roar         indicating
that        the     teams were out before he got to his seat, before                          he
got inside the ground in fact.


He     records           seeing     a Police Officer by each of              the     sets     of
turnstyles.               There are eight turnstyles, there are four                       sets,
I      think            four     Officers     there    and     I     seem    to      remember
additionally              there was one Police Officer at the side by                       gate
A     the     concertina gate who was directing people to                          turnstyles
but     no        other        Officers     I can recall.          I could   not     see     any
mounted Officers that I can recall.


I did not hear any announcements.


I was concerned that we might miss the start but more concerned
that the pressure outside as we got close to the turnstyles was
worse than I had ever encountered before.


There       was         a lady and old gentleman who were in some                   distress
outside           the     turnstyle.        The lady was allowed through and                 the
gentleman was let out of the side.


I     saw people climbing over.                 The Police seemed to be assisting
them climbing over.


Actually at the turnstyles people seemed to be                               moving     quite
smoothly through.


When I got in gate A was still closed.


As     I immediately got through the turnstyle there seemed to                                be
several       Police           Officers.      I observed people going up to                them
and asking them to gof outside and do something.


At    this        point        the Inquiry was adjourned to             10    o'clock       the
following morning.

VOLUME 1 - MORNING SESSION TUESDAY 16TH MAY 1989
PETER WILLIAM JACKSON RECALLED - EXAMINED BY MR COLLINS
CONTINUED


Jackson           thinks           he      entered through turnstyle 4.            He      made     a
passing           comment to a Police Officer that they would be                            better
used        outside              but    there 'was        several    people   going        to     the
turnstyles                 talking to Police Officers.               People were        concerned
about what was happening outside.


I     was       making for the north stand and on my ticket it said                                go
through           gangway C.               I could not see a sign pointing to gangway
C.      The signs did not appear to be in sequence.                             So I went the
other        way and ended up facing the courtyard at the entrance to
west        stand.              I then went back and found the side of the                      north
stand.            The           entrance        to the gangways is actually          under        the
north        stand.               So I had to go behind the           north stand, when             I
got     to        my        seat the           team were     still    warming    up.       Before
reaching          my seat and while I was looking where I should go                                I
saw     about              20    Police Officers come out from under                 the      north
stand        as        I    was going to enter under the north                  stand.          They
appeared           to be going towards the turnstyles and they                          appeared
to     have        a        sense of urgency. I did not                know   their purpose
                                   in/t*A 9~
however.               There                   still empty seats in the       stand      when       I
arrived.  I was seated in the stand row 5 I think seat 55 close
to the west stand.


As soon as I got into my seat I could see what I now know to be
two     pens,          the centre pens were very very full.                     People          were
trying          to climb out into the pens at the side and people                               were
being       pulled up into the west stand.                        The pens on either            side
of    the two centre pens looked quite relatively empty you could
spaces^you could see terrace, plenty of room for people.


About       1     or 2 minutes into the game I became aware                        of      people
trying       to        get over the front and onto the pitch.                    I      did      not
                                                 -   22 -


 know what was wrong.                  To me it looked like people trying to get
 out from what looked to be a too full pen.                           It didn't appear to
 be     any        hooliganism.          I have no precise recollection               of     the
 reaction           of    the Police Officers on the perimeter                  except       for
 seeing        one chap coming over and being led away as if arrested.
 I     was     not aware of gates in the perimeter fencing opening                            at
 any     stage.          I then saw fans at the edge of the pitch trying to
attract             players'         attention       I    did   not    hear    any      tannoy
announcements,                the    game   stopped shortly after             3.05    p.m.     I
stayed         in     the stand until abouot 4 o'clock.                  The witness         saw
what happened on the pitch which is demonstrated in the video.


^ e     first tannoy use I recall was when Dalglish came onto                                the
Police        observation            point to appeal to fans to keep                calm     and
co-operate.               That      was about 3.45 p.m.         The next       announcement
was     15     or 20 minutes later when they announced that the                             game
would be postponed and for people to keep their tickets and for
everybody to stay in the ground for a reasonable                                   period     to
avoid clashing with emergency vehicles.


I did not hear an announcement for people to get off the pitch.


I     went afterwards with Mr Taylor onto the pitch looked at                               the
gates and went to the press box and investigate afterwards the
scene.


Mr Hytner had no questions.


The     witness Jackson was then cross-examined by Mr Jackson page
5.      Cross-examined by Mr Jackson the witness Jackson confirmed
that     the        Football        Supporters Association             had    liaised      with
Liverpool City Council and had obtained some 200 statements and
the      witness              agreed    that   the        outline     given   by      Counsel
(presumably              an   opening)      reflected the views of the               200    odd
statements.              The witness said that all 200 statements had been
made     available            to the Inquiry.            The witness was content           that
there        was     no bias.        Mr Muller, Mr Duggan, Mr Maxwell                had     no
                                       -   23 -


  questions for the witness.


  The witness Jackson was then cross-examined by Mr Woodwood.

  Page 7.


  The witness was cross-examined as to his route to the ground, on
  previous years.


  The timing of his arrival previous years.


  The    witness said that the difference he noticed was that           this
( year     there     was   no checking of tickets until you got   to     the
  turnstyles        whereas the previous year his recollection is       that
  the checking point was at the outer gates.


  This witness was cross-examined in detail about the checking of
  his ticket the previous year by Police Officers.


  This     witness Woodwood established at page 11 D that the          crowd
  and    crush      he had given evidence to was no worse than    he     had
  encountered at other          football grounds - that is   within      the
  perimeter fence.


 The witness Jackson saw four foot Officers within the perimeter
  fence,      one   by each of the double turnstyles.   He did not       see
 mounted      Policemen.     It is suggested to him that in the area of
 the gates and the forecourt there was some 47 Policemen but the
 witness saw only 5.


 The witness was challenged concerning most of his evidence but
 was unshaken by the cross-examination.


 It     was   put to him that he did not see people climbing      up     or
 being pulled up into the west stand until much later but he did
 not accept this.
                                        -   24 -


The witness did not recall having seen a                 beach   ball     being
bounced up and down in pens 3/4.


The witness stated under cross-examination that the gates                    in
the perimeter fence were closed.


The witness Jackson was then cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.


The      witness accepted that even from            his advantage position it
was  difficult for him to get a clear               idea of precisely whatwas
going on.


The      witness accepted that even when            it became apparent tohim
that       something        very serious had gone wrong he really       had no
idea of the mechanism by which that had developed.               The witness
said he had no idea of causation.             This at page 19 at E.


The     witness was cross-examined on the question of the views he
h&d expressed and the criticisms he had made at the time on the
radio.


Mr Glasgow took him through some of his recollection                       and
criticism concerning the opening of the gate. Page 20.


Mr Glasgow took the witness Jackson into some detail concerning
the Officers he had seen moving from under the north stand.


The     witness     Jackson     was cross-examined concerning     the     area
where     the     witness     agreed to have seen    people   urinating     in
public in the central areas.  Inside the ground.              No. 21 of the
Police photographs as referred to.


At page 22 there is a great muddle over                 the   numbering     of
photographs and photographic bundles.


The fiasco over the photographs continues to the bottom of page
25.

                                               -   25 -




    This     witness could not give helpful evidence as to the                   nature
    of the signs for gents urinals. But the witness did agree that
    people urinated against the wall in public.


    At     page     28    the witness made comments concerning             the   tannoy
    system        and what he heard.      The witness eventually accepted             at
    page     29 the suggestion made by Mr Glasgow concerning the                    very
    high noise level and the fact that tannoy announcements                      might
    have been drowned.


    The witness was re-examined by Mr Collins.


    The    witness        Jackson was re-examined concerning the number               of
    people     attending      the ground this year as last year             which     he
    estimated       to    be the same.     He was questioned        concerning      his
    experience       at    Liverpool     and       the crowds   expected    there    he
    expressed       the    view that it was easy to get into Anfield.                He
    made     a favourable comparison between Anfield entrances to that
    of Sheffield. The witness, was not surprised that gate A should
    be open to relieve the crush.

    MISS ALISON BENNETT - CONTAINED IN VOLUME I QF'DAC'S DEPOSITION
    COPIES


 Called to give evidence on the morning session of Tuesday 16th
 May 1989 page 31. Examined by Mr Goldsack.


Alison        Jane          Bennett    lives     in the Mansfield area       and        is     a
    supporter          of    Liverpool.        She    attended the   match       with        her
boyfriend,              his brother, his friend and his girlfriend by                    car,
they        did not have tickets.              They hoped to obtain tickets              near
to the ground because they had gone early.                       They have done this
successfully                on     previous occasions.       They arrived        near     the
ground        at 11 o'clock.            They were successful in finding tickets
straight          away.          The witness then gave evidence as to the price
paid        and     the person they were bought from and the                 fact       that
there        was no Police presence.                 They went to a pub where           there
was     a     mixture of Liverpool and Nottingham Forest                    supporters,
there        was some group drinking, they walked right way round the
outside        of       the ground hoping to go in the Leppings                  Lane     epd
because       we        were Liverpool supporters although               their     tickets
were     for Spion Kop.               They talked to a Policeman about            getting
into the Leppings Lane end with the wrong tickets they had been
put     in    a little paddock to the righthand side of the Kop                          the
previous year as Liverpool supporters.                      The Policeman told them
to go round to the west stand and ask a Policeman or steward if
they     would let them in.               They arrived at about 1.30/1.45               p.m.
saw     a steward on the perimeter gate wearing a yellow vest                            who
told     them to try the turnstyle A.                  At that time there were           few
people       near           the turnstyles.     They were refused entry           at     the
turnstyle with that ticket and returned to the steward they had
spoken       to earlier.             They were told to try the turnstyle on the
right       because they had been letting such people in.                    It        would
either be turnstyle H or G.                    At that turnstyle we were searched
by the Police handed our tickets in and were let in.                         There was
a    Policeman              on the    outside of      the   turnstyle.      He     simply
searched          us        and we went through the turnstyle. We           were         not
asked       any questions.            Half the ticket was taken away.             It     was
                                                   -    27 -


 not     packed           inside.        The boys went to the toilet and               we       went
 through           the        tunnel.     I did not see any stewards            between          the
 turnstyle              and     the tunnel, none that I was concious of,                     there
 were       a     couple         of Police inside the ground            because       we        were
 searched              as we came out of the turnstyle.                There was no one V t
 the     entrance to the tunnel or the end of the tunnel.                              We       went
 to     the       lefthand side pen 4.                 It was about 1.40/1.45 p.m.                It
was      not very full.                 We positioned ourselves just over                  halfway
 up.        A      little        nearer to the left.            About 2.15/2.30        p.m.       we
 started          to     move      forward people were coming             in.         At    about
 2.40/2.45 p.m. we felt that the pen was full.                           People continued
to arrive.              We got shoved further and further forward we had to
duck        under a crash barrier to stop ourselves getting                            squashed
on     it.        We ducked under the barrier about 2.45/2.50 p.m.                               The
pressure              continued       and there seemed to be one big push                   about
2.55 p.m.              I do not know whether or not the players were on the
field        when the big push came I could not see anything.                              At the
time        the        push came there was only one person in front                        of     me
separating              me from the perimeter fence.               At that time my hands
were        infront of me and I              could not voluntarily move anything.
I     can        remember         being on the fence I could not breathe I                      was
frightened.               Two     boys     saved       me one was on     the     side       fence
between           the     next pen and one boy pushed me up and                   the       other
pulled           me     and he chucked me down to somebody else I was in the
crush        for         10or    so     minutes maybe          more,   everyone       was         in
difficulty and screaming there was little children being passed
over     the            top and girls. There were people on the                   pitch         and
there        was        some Policementhere I could see Policemen in                       front
of the fence in front.                    When people were originally climbing on
top     of       the fence the Police told them to get back in                         but       at
that     time           really     when I got out they were not             really          doing
anything           I     do not think they knew what was going on,                     we       did
not.         I    don't know where the perimeter gate was                       (it    appears
that     this girl got out into the next pen along) from the                                 next
pen     I was told to go through a gate and I went onto the                                 pitch
or     the track in front of the fence.                        Ambulances came later.             I
think       it        was a good 10 minutes before the Police realised                           it
                                         -   28 -


was not a pitch invasion.    I heard people asking for                    tickets
before the match at the ground and in the pubs.


The witness Bennett was cross-examined by Mr Hytner.


She     told him that she attended many football grounds away                    and
had seen electronic score boards giving figures and numbers and
had read messages to the crowd on some of those score                      boards
rather than over the tannoy.


Witness     Bennett cross-examined by Mr Jackson who she told that
she had         given the stub of the ticket she had            to    a    Police
Officer.        Mr Muller had no questions.


The     witness     Bennett     was cross-examined by Mr       Woodwood.          Mr
Woodwood        ascertained that this witness Bennett brought all the
programmes        from    all   the    matches she attends     all    over       but
ignored     the     all    ticket game warning in     the     Anfield      Review
because she was not from Liverpool she comes from Mansfield and
she could always get a ticket for a price.


Woodwood        endeavoured     to    establish what little    this       witness
could     see     from    her position, she could not see much            of     the
pitch,     the witness said that she could see Policemen in                    front
of     her she did not agree that the Police who were saying back,
back wanted people at the back to move back and said that these
words     were     directed at people on the top of the         fence.          She
could not see the pitch she could only see in front of her and
up. She could see two Policemen.


Re-examined        by Mr Collins the witness Bennett established that
the     bottom     of the pen is below the level of the pitch and                to
have     someone     standing    outside the pen and you are         near       the
bottom you cannot see further than the people just in front of
the pen.

    Witness Daniel Joseph Hennesy
    Morning Session on Tuesday 16th Mav 19R9
    Volume 1 of the Depositions at page 43


    This     witness lives in Crosby in Liverpool and is a student                       at
    Leeds     Polytechnic.        He   had       a    ticket   for    the    game.      His
    experience     was   similar to the previous witnesses, he                   thought
    the     conditions outside the turnstiles were getting very                       tight
    and then there was a release when gate C was opened                          and     he
    walked through it.


    This    witness   was    in    pen 3 and was pulled              out    through    the
    perimeter fence at a gate by a Policeman who was                         leaning     in
    trying to pull people out.


    This witness had some concussion and his                    recollection         might
    well be clouded by that injury.


    He does not introduce anything new.

        He was called by Mr Goldersack.


        Keith Gelding lives in the Walton area of Liverpool.   He had a
        ticket.


        This witness' evidence adds nothing to that which I have    set
        out previously in the synopsis.

Ian John Clark lives in Liverpool.                              He had a   ticket.      This
witness went into pen 3.


At    page 65 at A he gives evidence about a barrier giving                            way.
It was the barrier to the right hand side of the pen                                 towards
the centre.


Cross       examined by Mr Glasgow at page 78 this witness says that
he    was     quite       sure the crush had got bad                enought   to     change
people's        colour before he even had the impression of a barrier
failing.


Re-examined         by Mr Collins.             Clark confirmed that having looked
at   the      photograph as to where the barrier that in fact                         broke
was he accepted that it was not the failure of the barrier that
caused the surge. This at page 79C.


At page 79F Mr Collins stated that although other barriers were
bent only one went down.


Otherwise        this witnesses evidence does not take the matter any
further.        After       witness        Clark there was an          adjournment      for
lunch.

Witness David Perry
Afternoon session Tuesday 16th Mav 1989
Volume 1 of DAC transcript bundles page 80


The    witness       Perry was examined by Mr Goldsack.      The   witness
comes from                             Liverpool. He is a taxi
driver. He had a ticket. He had a drink in a pub on the way to
the    ground.        He saw ticket touts and speaks about     "stewards"
offering         to get youngsters into the ground for £5.00 without a
ticket      at    all.   This is at page 8ID.   This witness went     into
pen 4.


He    was   at the game the previous year and said that if it         was
organised last year it was not this year. This at page 83H.


He had been in the stand the previous year so it was different.
He arrived early at about 1.30 pm.


This witness thought everything was normal for a football match
so far as the crush was concerned at 2.30 pm, but then              there
was a main surge at 3.00 pm or thereabouts.


This witness' evidence ends at page 89 and adds nothing to that
which has gone before.

Afternoon session of Tuesday 16th May 1989



David       Anthony    Cruice   lives       in
Liverpool.         He had a ticket. Him and his friends had a        drink
on the way.        This witness was in pen 3.


At page 95H he recalls hearing the Nottingham Forest team being
announced     on    the tannoy."It was a decent tannoy".      This      at
page 96A.


This witness        saw in detail his friend crushed against one       of
the barriers.


At   page    98C    this witness   states that he saw three   or     four
Policemen     the     other side of the perimeter fence    telling    the
spectators     to     go   back out of the exits.   This   witness    was
suddenly aware of the gate in the perimeter fence being opened
and Police dragging people out.


Otherwise this witness does not add anything to that which has
gone before.

Patrick        Cunningham lives in Neverton in Merseyside.                         He had        a
ticket for the West stand. He had two pints of bear                                 at      the
Public House, The Gate.


This      witness saw no signs inside the ground to the stands.                             He
saw     no stewards inside the ground.                        He saw no Policemen inside
the     ground.           This      witness did not get to the             stand    he    was
carried with a surge of people onto the terrace.                             The    witness
finished up in pen 3.


Cross examined by Mr Woodward, he said at page 110E                                that     he
still had his ticket in his hand unused.


Cross examined by Mr Glasgow on page 114D, the witness accepted
that     if     there had been a Policeman or stewards around to                          ask
where      the West stand it would not have made any difference                             to
him     being carried along with the crowd.                         The witness said that
had     there been Police or a steward present and he did not                             see
any, he would not have had an opportunity to talk to them even
if he had been aware of them.


Re-examined by Mr Collins at page 115, this witness establishes
that there was noone to ask where the West stand was once                                   he
got inside the ground.


Otherwise this witness' evidence produces nothing that does not
already appear.

He was examined by Mr Philips.


Keith       Leonnard lives in Liverpool                      district and is a          Council
Housing       Warden.           This witness had a ticket.                He went by      mini
bus and most of the people on the mini bus had a couple of cans
of beer each.


This     witness         saw     Gate C opened.            He went into pen        3.     This
witness became doubled over a barrier.                             At a later stage he was
aware of four or five Policemen having entered the terrace from
the     pitch side to assist the crowd.                       Page 125G.    This     witness
eventually          went       through the gate in the perimeter               fence       and
noticed that the wire mesh at the side of the gate                                 had    been
ripped up. Page 126C.


Cross       examined by Mr Glasgow this witness said that he                            thinks
he    saw     one     steward inside the ground at the gate                    which       was
opened.        Page 133C and D at page 135A Mr Glasgow refers to the
video and referrs to people running as an important point.


Other than this the witness covered no new important points.

 Wayne     Windever          is     19 years of age and lives,in                   Liverpool |
 area.       He     did not have a ticket for the match.                          He     bought        a
 ticket      for     the Leppings Lane end                   from a place by           the     North
 stand.        He went in through the big gates that got opened.                                     He
 saw     a Policeman opened those gates.                      The Policeman opened them
 from       the inside.            He saw a steward near thegate with a yellow
macX               Page 137E and F.             He went into pen3.


Crossexamined by Mr Woodward at page 143B the witness                                    says       the
way it was organised and that there was no direction to                                             say
"got that side, or got that side".


Mr     Woodward       however established that he new his                          way      anyway.
Page      143C.       At     page      143F the witness says                that       he     saw    a
Policeman         "beat someone in the face" to someone being a person
trying      to     got     over the fence to get out.                      The     witness       was
apparently saving that piece of information to bring out at the
inquiry.   At page 144G the witness says that                                    the   Policeman
kicked someone. Through the mesh.


The     witness      was      cross       examined by          Mr     Glasgow.         In      cross
examination this witness said that nobody was running when they
came     through       the        gate.     In further           cross      examination          the
witness       simply contridicts himself as to running and                               walking.
The     witness      did not wish to alter a statement to                          the        effect
that "there was a madff rush to get to in the ground."                                      This at

 Witness Garry Gains
Volume— 1— of DAC transcript bundle paae 146
Called and examined by Mr Collins


Garry     Gains is from Whiston in Liverpool.              He had a ticket for
Leppings Lane standing area on the terraces.                 The witness seems
to say that there were a few cans of beer on the coach.                      He and
others bought some cans of beer at a Gateway supermarket.                         They
drank     them     sitting on the grass.           Two cans each.    His     ticket
was     collected       as he went through the turnstile and           the        stub
given     back     to    him.    This witness saw gate C       and    asked        two
Policeman        and    one steward standing there whether he could                 go
through.         The steward "no, you have to got through that tunnel
there",     which       is the tunnel leading onto pen 3.           This     is     at
page     150D.      This witness was close to the barrier which                   gave
way.     Page 152 at C.         The witness seems to say that the barrier
went shortly after or about the time the teams came onto                           the
pitch. This at page 152F.


He was cross examined by Mr King.             The witness could see Police
and     stewards on the pitch side and he saw the perimeter                  fence
gate opened, but then shut again about 2.55 pm.                 This at        page
153F.


Cross     examined      by   Mr Woodward at page 153, the           question       of
the     amount of drinking was covered, the witness insisted                   that
he had three cans of beer.   Other than the above this                     witness
gave little that had not been given before.


The inquiry adjourned to 10.00 am the next day, ie                    Wednesday
17th May 1989.

 Lord Justice Taylor opened the proceedings prior to the witness
Mark       Hughes being called with a bullet at the press reporting.
 He    threatened              to withdraw the provision of statements of                          the
witness to the press as them came in into the witness box.


Mark      Hughes          is     19 years of age and a hairdresser who                       had     a
ticket        for the Leppings Lane standing end.                          The face value           of
the ticket was £6.00 but he paid £30.00 for it to a friend of a
client       who had a season ticket.                    The friend he travelled                  with
to the match did not have a ticket and intended to buy one from
the     ticket        touts.            This    witness was being           examined         by     Mr
Goldsack.         Evidence was given about ticket touts.                         This witness
went      into      pen        3.   This witness lpst                consciousness      at        some
stage,       he thinks for about 15 minutes.                         He does not appear             to
have      had     any      Police of steward assistance during                        his    first
period       of       unconsciousness             but he passed out again               and was
helped       by       a    Policeman           who appeared to have come               from the
direction of the tunnel. The witness thinks                                  that     Liverpool
should have had a lot more tickets. Page 8E.


The witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward.                               The witness was
again      cross       examined          on ticket touts.              Touting    around          the
turnstiles.            The       witness did not see anybody trying to                       offer
money to the turnstile operators to be allowed in.                                At page 11C
the     witness        says that once he got in he did not where                            to     go
apart      from      there was a tunnel so he j u s t                        .   Mr    Woodward
established               that      a    point, certainly by 3.05 came                 when the
witness looked and he saw that the gate in the perimeter fence
was actually open.


There is nothing further of interest in this witness' evidence.

                                        (XCJL                                  ________
 David        Hughes is a furnies- operator and lives in                                       South
 Wirril. He had got a ticket for the match in Liverpool for the
 standing area at the Leppings Lane end.


 He     had     two        pints and a meal on the way to the match                       at    the
 Silver        Fox     Public House at Stocksbridge.                      His friend that        he
 was     traveling          with had the same.              There were other           Liverpool
 supporters           drinking in the pub.                Before going to the match              he
 got     two        cans    of beer from an Off Licence.                     Other    Liverpool
 supporters          were      buying beer there.              They drank those cans             of
beer before they got to the ground, because it was obvious that
they     would not be allowed to take it in.                             This witness got        to
the     ground        at     about 2.00 at which time                    supporters    were      in
queues        on both sides of the fence between turnstiles 1-16                                and
A-G.       They       were      all orderly queues.               He saw a     Policeman         on
every      turnstiles           right in the middle and the                  Policeman         were
searching           everybody as they went in.                  He saw four Policemen on
horseback.            He did not see any stewards outside the ground                             at
that time.           He went into pen 3.


At     page     19G this witness states that there was a                            Policewoman
and     a Policeman at the other side of the perimeter fence                                   just
looking        in.     The Policewoman was just panicking herself so far
as he could see.              "she just did not know what to do".


This witness saw one gate to his lefthand side in the perimeter
fence open three times. People were trying to get out and the
Police were throwing them back in again. Page 2OB.


At     page     21C this witness speaks of seeing a                         blond     Policeman
behind        the     Policewoman         speaking into and               listening    to      his
portable radio.    This witness was eventually lifted over                                     the
side fence into pen 2.

 Cross        examined        by   Mr Jackson this witness said that         he     was
 about 15 feet away from the Officers who he saw                     throw        three
 supporters back into the terrace area.


 Cross        examined by Mr Woodward this witness said that with                  his
 friend        he     had     time to kill because of the time that         he     had
 arrived        at the ground, and had had a few drinks and had looked
 over        the bridge at the water and a Policeman had said "come on
 lads everbody go in". There were people moving around wanting
 tickets and saying any spares, any spares.


When         asked    the witness said that the Police were doing             their
 job     and     it    was very jolly.      At page 26A there is at         last     a
mention        of     the beach ball where a witness actually saw it.               He
 says it was          a massive ball.      I am not clear precisely where the
large        ball     was being bounced.        At page 32B this witness          says
that the gate to the perimeter fence was forced open and two or
three Policemen were trying to force it closed again.


Cross        examined       by Mr Glasgow this witness said that when              the
gate     to the perimeter fence first opened only one person could
fall     out at a time.            This at page 32G.   The witness said           that
it     was     only opened for seconds, people were just grabbed                   and
put back in again, then it was closed again. Page 32G.                     At page
33C the witness says that there was a good possibility that the
gate in the perimeter fence if it only could be opened from the
outside        was opened in order to put people who had climbed over
the fence back^onto the terrace.                The witness does not know who
the     gate        mecanisim for opening it operated.       At page 33G          the
witness        says     that if the gate had been left open          the    people
around        him     would    not    have been able to    filter    through       it
because        the crush was so great.          "it would not have helped          at
all".


He     was     re-examined         by Mr Collins when at   page     35A    Counsel
appears to establish that this witness was standing immediately
front of the barrier which collapsed.

 Witness:  Anthony Barnbrock examined by Mr.Goldsack at page                                       35
 on the morning session of Wednesday 17th May 1989.


Anthony Barnbrock lives in Liverpool

______________________________I*                   This witness saw the two mounted

police       outside       the gate and two inside the gate,                         he had with

him    his    13 year old brother and with                        his    father.           They   got

caught up in the crush outside the ground.                                   Once this witness

got    to the other side of the turnstile he saw between                                      3 0 and

50 policemen.           This at page 37F.



The    police     searched my             father.     The witness            did     not    see   any

stewards inside the turnstiles. This witness gives evidence of

the    conservation          he had with a policeman                 about         the policeman

not    being     able       to    move,    not      having    a   radio        only        sergeants

upwards.       This at page 3 8D.



This    witness       saw        the    gate   to    the     right      of     the    turnstiles

opened and 100 or 150 people enter.                         This at page 38G.



The    witness       then    said that he            saw    about       50    police       marching

through the gate just after.                     This at page 3 9C.



At    page    42E,     F    & G        the witness         says   that       Bruce     Grobbelar

(Liverpool goalkeeper)                 spoke to a policeman and a policewoman

opened the gate in the perimeter fence,                           25 or 3 0 went through

the    gate at that stage and my father and 13 year old brother

got out with them and I went to get out the gate closed again.

The policeman shut the gate.
At page 43D the witness says that the gate was again opened by

the     same    policewoman           and    this     witness          and    some       others       got
through.



Page     45A    this        witness    speaks       of        20    police    dogs       with     their

handlers snarling and biting at them.



At    page     4 6A    the witness          speaks       of    an     announcement         over       the

loudspeakers           to    clear    the     pitch       because       the       game    would       not

start until           the pitch was cleared.                       He says that the         time       of

that    was     about       3.15/3.20pm.           The     witness          had    not    heard       any

announcements prior to that.



At page 4 6D the witness expresses the opinion that the police

reacted       very,     very     slowly.           The    older       police       seemed        to    be

intent       upon     clearing        the    pitch       whereas        the       younger       police

seemed to be trying to help the injured.



The witness was cross-examined by Mr.Jackson.



At page       47E the witness describes an argument between                                     a male

and    female         police    officer        concerning             the     opening       of        the

perimeter gate.



The witness was cross-examined by Mr.Woodward.



At    page    48H     the witness           says    that       there     needed      to     be    more

organisation at the turnstiles.
                                    Ul/l
At   page   49D the witness   describes     the   situation     outside    the

turnstiles as "every man for himself".



At page 50C the witness describes one of the mounted officers

as   shouting   and   screaming   leaning    down   off   his    horse     and

giving you a clout.     He also says "the police just gave up".



At page     51B the witness says there were no ticket touts               just

by the turnstiles and even the people who were on the roof had

tickets and those going through the gate that had been opened
had tickets in their hands.



At page     52D the witness talks about 50 police and another              30

police    just inside the turnstiles and then says            "yes,   it has

been verified in the papers as well that that had happened".



Other than the foregoing this witness did not add anything                 to

that which has been said before.

Witness:  David Cunningham examined by Mr.Phillips
Vol. 1 of DAC bundle of transcripts.
Morning session of Wednesday 17th May 1989.



David        Cunningham       lives   in                                     Liverpool

and had obtained a stand ticket prior to attending the match.

For the west stand.              He with friends stayed at the Silver Fox

at Stockbridge for about a hour and had a couple of drinks                           on

the way.        This witness swapped his stand ticket for a terrace

ticket.        This at Page 56B.



At    page     57C    this witness         says    that   a mounted    policeman    was

telling       everyone    to push back            and to organise      themselves    in

some kind of way outside the turnstiles.



At page 58F this witness says that he did not know that at the

end     of    the    tunnel    there   was        partitioning   and   did   not   know

until he went back on the following Tuesday.



At page 60F this witness says that on the touch-line he saw a

WPC and a PC shouting "push back, push back".



Witness Cunningham was cross-examined by Mr.Woodward.



At page 62F this witness said that there were a lot of people

around who had had a drink but there was no one drunk.



Other    than       the above    this witness         did not say anything         that

has not been described heretofore.
Witness:    Peter Darcy examined by Mr.Collins
Vol. 1 D A C 's bundle of transcripts.
Morning session of Wednesday 17th May 1989.



Peter Darcy is a Liverpool supported and had a ticket for the

terrace.     This witness arrived at the ground with his brother

and brother-in-law very early at about 1.0 0pm.


At page 6 6G this witness says he was under the impression that

the only way     he could get   into Leppings     Lane    lower   standing

was    to actually go down the tunnel.     He didn't see any other

directions.



At page 67E the witness says that the terrace was very full              in

the middle but comparatively empty at the side pens.



At page 6 9D the witness says he heard a Tannoy a announcement,

not very clear,     to move back onto    the    terrace   and clear     the

pitch.     The announcement was at about 3.15/3.20pm.



The witness was cross-examined by Mr.Woodward.



This   witness   said nothing which adds       anything   to   that   which

has gone before.

Witness: Ian Devine examined by Mr.Collins.
Vol. 4 of D A C 1s bundle of transcripts.
Morning session of Wednesday 17th May 1989.



Evidence      commences       on    Page      70     —   Ian    Devine         lives      in

_________ but       is a Liverpool supporter. He with his                            friends had

 tickets      for the terraces.



At    page   71H     and    72B    this     witness       describes            the   difference

between      this    year    and    last      year       as    there      being      a    lack    of

organisation        outside        the     ground        this       year.       This       witness

originally got into Pen 3 but anticipating additional crushing

climbed over the fence into Pen 2.                       This at page 72H.



At    page   7 4B    the    witness       describes           two    or     three        policemen

standing on the top of the railings pushing people                                   back onto
the terraces.



At page       7 4C the witness describes onepolice                          officer who          was

shouting at other police officers to lift them out.He lifted

people out the others kept pushing people back in.



The     witness      Devine        was      cross-examined                by     Mr.Woodward.

Mr.Woodward questioned             this witness           in detail            comparing       1988

Hillsborough organisation outside the ground with 1989.



At page 77 C, D, E, F and G this witness says that outside the

turnstiles the mounted police charged their horses through the

crowd   .....       with the witness which continued to page                               78F   on

this matter.        This witness apparently got into Pen 3 but then
                              H i   /7
crossed to the right and climbed over the fence into the next

pen.   End of this witness.



The Inquiry adjourned for lunch until 2.00pm.
Witness:  Peter Joseph Garrett was examined by Mr.Goldsack.

Peter    Joseph      lives     in                                            ILiverpool,

arrived     in Sheffield at 10.30am and made his way                        to Leppings

Lane    at about     2.00pm.        He did not find a pub.              At    that time

there were nice orderly queues at about 2.15pm.                        They only saw

two police officers           outside   the   turnstiles,         he    saw a lot       of

police     inside    the     turnstiles    searching    people         as    they     came

through although        they had already been          searched outside.                He

went to Pen 3 first.           It was quite full in there so he climbed

over    into Pen     4 which was empty and          stayed    in that pen.              He

was    just to the left of the gate in the perimeter fence,                          about
2 0 1 away.



At page 83H and 84A this witness describes people fighting to

get through the         little gate       in the perimeter         fence and          says

nobody organised the exist of people through that gate.



The witness Garrett was cross-examined by Mr.Woodward.



The witness Garrett was cross-examined by Mr.Glasgow.



At page 86G Mr.Glasgow put to the witness that it is normal                            at

football      grounds   for    the    perimeter   fence      to    be       policed    by

policemen      as   distinct    from    stewards.      The    witness          did    not
accept this.
At page 87F Mr.Glasgow put it to the witness             that once people

understood the problem they did what they could about it.               The

witness    said that they understood too         late   because    it was   a

good four minutes before the gate was opened.



The witness did concede at page 87G that if there had been any

way    in which   people   could   have   got   spectators   out   earlier,

once   they did appreciate what had gone wrong           they would have

done so.    End of this witness.

    Afternoon session Wednesday 17th May 1989.



    Page 88.

    David Lowe is a friend of the witness Alison Bennett and lives

    in Mansfield.          This witness did not have a ticket and expected

    to    get one     from    a        ticket      tout.           He   got    a   ticket    for     the

    Nottingham       end     but       had    to   get        in     the    Liverpool      end,     this

    witness     moreorless         repeats         the       evidence         concerning       getting

    into    the ground as given by Alison Bennett,                                 the    provisional

■   steward    refused       him        and   then       a operator           of    the   right-hand

    turnstile       let him in.           He didn't have to say anything                       to    the

    turnstile operator,            he just showed him his ticket and he was

    let through.           This witness went into Pen 4.                           The witness was

    cross-examined by Mr.King and Mr.Woodward.



    At page 93B it was put to the witness by Mr.Woodward that when

    it was realised there was something that had really gone wrong

    the    police    tried        to    help.          The        witness     answered      "we     were

    outside the ground before the police started helping".



    Cross-examined by Mr.Glasgow the                          witness Lowe was            questioned

    about the manner he bought his ticket.                              The witness cleared up

    the    point    that    the    article         in     the       Guardian       newspaper      about

    stewards kept match tickets hidden up sleeve was fallacious                                      he

    had bought the ticket on the corner of Penistone Road                                      across

    from the park.         End of witness.

Witness:    Jeffrey Nigel Moody.
Vol. 1 D A C 's bundle of transcripts.
Afternoon session Wednesday 17th May 1989



Page 94.

Jeffrey Nigel Moody comes from                                 and is a friend of

Mr.Devine      who     gave   evidence    before     lunch.     He    is    a    Chelsea

supporter.        He was examined by Mr.Goldsack.              This witness           said

that he was very experienced going to many,                     many grounds            but

at page 94 G he said the congestion outside the gate was a lot

more     severe     than he had ever        experienced       before    personally.

The witness         waited    for his    friends     to come    through.         He     did

not see any signs telling him where to go.                     He saw about four

police      officers     inside    the    ground     and    about    two    or     three

stewards but they were not marshalling anybody at all.                            He saw

people      climbing over the turnstile roof at the                  time    and      they

just were not even being stopped.                  This at page 96C.            He went

into Pen 3.         He finished up about 5' to the right of the gate

in the perimeter fence.



At   page    98A,     B and C this witness          gives    evidence       about       the

police      officer    and WPC being      requested        to open   the gate           and

spectators being told to push back, push back, push back.                             This

witness     lost consciousness and found himself out on the pitch.

While    he was conscious he did not hear                  any announcement over
the loud speaker.



The witness Moody was cross-examined by Mr.Woodward.                            Counsel

took this witness through a lot of detail as to his position

in   relation     and by reference        to various photographs                which    I
failed to see as being particularly important.



The witness Moody was re-examined by Mr.Collins.             Again    this

witness was     taxed by various questions as to     the position       of

barriers   in    relation   to   photographs   the   point    of     which

immediately escapes me but this appears at page 102.

 Witness: Christopher Moran - examined by Mr.Collins
 Vol.l D A C 's bundle of transcripts.
 Afternoon session Wednesday 17th May 1989.



 Page 103.

 Christopher Moran is a Liverpool                      supporter living at Garston.

 He had a ticket for the terraces.                       He went in a party of 8 on

 a coach holding 40 individuals.                      This witness took a four pack

of beer cans and drank three of them.                             They were not              stopped

and searched by the police, they arrived in Sheffield and went

to an Off-Licence               and got      three     cans      of    lager,      this    witness

said    "I drank         two of them,         the cans        hold      just under         a pint.

When    I     go    to    Anfield      I have     three       pints       before       the    match

there".        The    witness         compared    this      year       with     last      year    and

said    the previous year               there    had been orderly               queues.          This

witness       did not      realise it but he            apparently entered                 through

the concertina gate and as he came through the gate he saw the

sign    "A"    and       "B"    either    side    a    sign       above       "Standing".          He

thought he would need his ticket at that point but it turned

out    that    he    didn't      have    to     show    a    ticket.          He   was     carried

through       that       gate    by    the    crowd.         He       carried      through       the

tunnel.       He     finished up in Pen 4.                  On    a crush barrier             about
the middle of the pen.



At    page    108E       this    witness      says     that       he    heard      one       Tannoy

announcement while he was on the pitch,                           the announcement said

"get off the pitch".              This witness looked at the clock when he

got onto the pitch and it was 3.25pm.



At page 108G this witness says that when he got onto the fence
 and pulled himself over there was a policeman                            standing       about

 3'    away but he just had to throw himself over,                         the policeman

 gave him no assistance getting down off the fence.



 At page 108H this witness says that the policeman did not know

what     to do,      they were just young lads 23-24.                    He did not       see

 any stewards.            He did not see any stewards at any time.



At page 109B.

The witness was cross-examined by Mr.Jackson.



On     pages     109,      110    and   111    there       is    a     somewhat    chaotic

discussion          between Woodward,         Collins      and Lord Justice         Taylor

about the photographs,              the list of photographs and the timing
of the photographs.



Returning to the cross-examination by Mr.Jackson he told Moran

that he was seeking to find the deployment of police officers

at     the    time   he    was   describing        it as   he    was     going    into    the
turnstiles.



This    has    all been gone into in what precedes                      this particular

note and I do not pursue it here.



At page 112C Jackson in cross-examination suggested that there

were    a larger number of police officers                      deployed    in blocking

the entrance         to the stand but the witness said that he                       could

not    see    the    police      officers     on   foot    he    could    only    see    the
mounted police.
The witness was cross-examined by Mr,Woodward.



This cross examination established at page                           115A, B and C that

this witness          did not        see a line of mounted police                   as he was

shown in the centre of a photograph, at the time he was going

towards       the gate he was going like a bullet out of a gun                                  and

he     could not stop himself or look round,                        he   did not see            any

uniformed police officers inside the gate and did not see any

uniformed officers inside and beyond the turnstiles.



Cross-examined         by     Mr.Glasgow        he   said     at    page     115D       that    the

oniy     persons      he    saw in uniform           inside    the gate       when       he     was

being carried along were two programme sellers standing on the

steps       towards    the     west     stand    behind       the     goal.        Mr.Glasgow

suggested      to this witness that "if anybody had been                                standing

on    the ground you would not have been able to see them would

you?".       The witness replied "you could not see three people                                 in

front of you".             Page 115E.



At page      115F and G Mr.Glasgow succeeded                       in establishing             that

the    witness     could      not    have   paid      any     regard     even      if    he     had

wanted to to any directions that anybody could have given him

at    that    stage,       the witness      tried     to go        through    the       wall     at

gate    C    but he        could not control his            movements        and        was just

taken down       the       tunnel.     Further, Mr.Glasgow established                         that

even though the            witness knew there was a way round at                        the side

he could not physically get there and the witness said that he

could not even see the wall or the gap.
At page 116C,   D, E and F Lord Justice Taylor established from

the witness Moran by reference to photographs and/or plan the

precise barrier practically in the middle of Pen 4 where Moran

was and a man died next to him.

       Witness: Roy Parry examined by Mr.Goldsack
       Vol. 1 of D A C 's bundle of transcripts.
       Afternoon session Wednesday 17th May 1989



       Page 117.

       The witness Roy Parry is from St.Helens and attended the match

      with his two sons aged 8 and 10.                          They arrived at the entrance

       in    Leppings      Lane       at    about    2.15pm.           They       did    not    have     more

       trouble      than       usual        progressing         to     the    turnstiles,          it     was

      fairly orderly.                Once    inside they          followed         the crowd       through

      the tunnel and went to the right trying to get behind the goal

(     if    they   could.        To the front if possible.                     They got to a bout

      four    rows       from    the       front    in    Pen     3.       They    got    there        before

      2.3 0pm and the pen was quite full                        then.



      They    finished          up   however       in the       right-hand          corner       of Pen     3

      simply because of people coming behind them.                                  They were OK           in

      that position            until       the match      started          and then       tried to        get

      further      back    if they could.                This witness was                only     somewhat

      uncomfortable because of his children and recalled an incident

      when someone had hit the goal-post and it was after that that
i ;
      he decided         to try to change                his position.             About          twominutes

      after     that they became more                    uncomfortable.             Hetried        to    get

      them back.          He    succeeded in getting half way                           along    the    wall

      and then      stayed       there       for a       couple      of minutes.          The     witness

      indicated      a    wall       on     top    of which        there      was       a fence.        The—

      witness managed            to drag the         two children behind him and                         got

      right up to the back.                  He ended up alongside the tunnel.                           The

      witness      said    "I should think it could 15 minutes.                                 I did not

      know what had happened                 to others down                at the       front until       we
                                                      1+/ If %

 were      on our way home".             Note:    this evidence is at about page

 119.       At the time this witness Parry was going back out of                                     the

 tunnel      people were          still coming towards him into                       the ground,

he     said       they    looked    like     spectators.             He    did       not     see     any

policeman in the tunnel at that stage or stewards, neither did

he     see    any policeman or stewards                     at the    top       of    the     terrace
before reaching the tunnel.



They       left through a sliding door.                     At the time they went out

there were people coming in through that gate.                                    They were not

in     uniform      and    they     were    not       stewards.           There       were       people

coming       in groups,         it was     not a trickle.             There were             a    large

number       of people outside             the   ground,         in the     roadway          heading

towards       the ground.          This witness             said that he             didn't       think

they       were    going       through    the    turnstiles          at    that       stage,       they

were going into the door that he was coming out of.



Cross-examined by Mr.Woodward he was taken through his                                           timing

again       and    further       examined       him    in    respect       of     his       accurate

position in the pen at various times.



At    page     124F      the    witness     speaks      about        the    apparently             only

thing he found particularly at normal which was the noise.                                           He

says       "there was a lot of shouting and you could hear a bit of

screaming and I got a little bit frightened because                                        I didn't

know what had happened but I thought                             something        might       happen

and    I    just    dragged       the boys       out of       the    ground          but    the    one

thing I do remember was the noise.                           It was a different noise

to the noise you usually hear at a football match.                                         it was    a
noise of,    something might have gone wrong and it was              only

the   way   home   when   we   found   out   what   had   happened   that

associated the noise with - yes, that is that type of noise"

 (missing tape 6 with begining of statement of Mr Parry)



 Cross        examined by Mr Glasgow.            Mr Glasgow challenged Mr         Parry
 on     the times that he had given in his evidence to Mr Woodward.
 The     witness       Parry accepted that he could well be mistaken                    in
 his     timings.          The witness said that he had been guessing                  his
 timings          because he did not really know.          Mr Glasgow      suggested
 to     the witness Parry that if there were still people coming in
 a     flow       through the tunnel when he left with his            children         as
 early       as     he did then that must have been very             shortly      after
 3*00,       and    the    witness   responded that it         had   taken       him     a
considerable          time to get through the tunnel because he had                    to
fight his way through the crowd and this was the reason he gave
for thinking of the time.


Mr Glasgow suggested to the witness that it must have been that
he     set     off on that journey much earlier than he now                believed
but the photographs taken at 3.00 of the crowd demonstrated the
impossibility of the timing he had assumed.


Mr Glasgow suggested to the witness that it would not have been
physically possible for him to go from the front to the back of
the crowd at anything                after       3.00,   but   the   witness      only
responded "Mm.".


The     witness       refused    to assume a        recollection     of   something
particular          happening that caused him to take his children out,
it     was     just that they were distressed and he decided to                   drag
them     out.       The cross examination with Mr Glasgow finished with
the witness accepting that his timing had been a guess.


Re-examined          by Mr Collins, the witness said that the game                 had
started       before he moved back, he recalled a shot that hit                    the
cross     bar       before he moved up the pen and he had started                 five
rows     back       from   the corner which is five rows back             from    the
front    and       moved up right on the edge.           They started     to     move
immediately after the shot had missed.   He insisted that he did
not remember a sudden surge. it was only the discomforture of
the children that made him move.

 W itn e ss John P h im e ste r
 Volume 1 of DAC transcript of evidence page 12 8
 Afternoon session of Wednesday 17th May 1989


 John     Phimester       lives       in   Wallasey and is   a   retired        school
 teacher.         He is       a    Liverpool supporter over      25    years.       He
 attended        the    cup game at Sheffield both in 1988 and 1989.                He
attended         with    three others this year.        He arrived at 1.00         pm
and     went      to    a pub, the Bee Hive and drank about 3            pints     of
beer.       There       were about 2 hundred Liverpool supporters in the
Bee Hive, when the witness left the pub he described the fellow
drinkers        as     being       in a happy state of mind, he did       not     see
anyone      the worse for drink.            He had a seat in the West       stand.
The     witness        at page 129C and D described, as other            witnesses
have described the difference in the situation that he met upon
his arrival            at the ground as it was in 1988 and as it was               in
1989.


This witness was unfortunate before he ever got into the ground
at page 129E he describes having asked the mounted Policeman if
he     was in the right place for the stand, and was told that                     he
should be on the other side of that blue gate.                   There was a big
blue     gate     that       was    opened against the wall,     and     then     the
Policeman's          horse     got between his friend and the witness             and
the left rear foot of the horse stood on the witness' left food
fracturing        a toe and taking the nail off another toe.               At page
129G the witness gives evidence that at about 2.40 pm at a time
I asked him a question and I heard the mounted Officer shouting
into     his intercom "for gods sake get more men out here".                      The
witness        identified the gate he was talking about on the model.
The     witness got through a turnstile after being crushed by the
crowd     at     about 2.50 pm, and saw the steps leading up               to    the
stand     that he wanted.            He went there and that was where he saw
the     first steward who tore the edge off his ticket.                 From     his
stand     seat       row 29 seat 137, he thought he could not see               into
the    terraces but could see the perimeter and could see all                     of
the    goal.         He could just see the top of the perimeter            fenqe.
                                           -   45 -


About     four       minutes to 3 somebody said to him "oh no they                 are
getting       onto the pitch".       This was shortly after the game               had
started.        At    page    13IE   and F the         witness   makes    a     highly
critical       statement as to the activities of the Police in                    many
Police failing to assist supporters who had been injured.                         Some
Police were helping but some 200 Policemen across the middle of
"the pitch were ]ust standing there while people were lying                         on
■the ground not receiving attention.


At     page 131G this witness is critical of the arrangements made
for     all    the    tickets     he had seen being          marked    turnstile     D
whether standing or sitting which held a very large number                          of
people into a very small number of turnstiles.


Cross     examined by Mr Gibbson-Watt.                Counsel made a point        that
concerning       the witness' complaint that all the tickets he                    new
of     were marked "turnstile D " , and his impression that this was
done     by    the FA, Counsel made the point that the FA                 does     not
make   that          sort    of   detail       arrangement    for     tickets      for
turnstiles.


Cross     examined      by   Mr Woodward, the witness was             again      taken
through       his movements and his timings.             Around page 135 it         is
discovered       that there was some confusion as to precisely which
turnstile this witness was making for, but they do not propose
to pursue this here.


Cross    examined       by Mr Glasgow he established that the                 witness
Phimester had a ticket which had the words "West stand" printed
on it.    The witness said that the Police had a photocopy of his
ticket stub which was marked "turnstile B, West stand, gangway
Z , row 23, seat 137."


Those    acting for the Police did not have the photocopy of                      the
ticket stub available at the inquiry but it was promised to be
produced.
                                 -   46 -


On     page 137 at G, Mr Glasgow informed Lord Justice Taylor that
such     a ticket for the West stand provided it was not a forgery
automatically follows the computer line (whatever that means),
and it will have a "C" on it.

 David        Postoewaite is from Chester and arrived in Sheffield                              at
 about midday.              This witness arrived at that time in response to
 the Liverpool programme printed against Sheffield Wednesday the
 Police           instructions        requesting supporters to arrive                   sometime
after 10.30, and so this witness arrived at 12.00 o'clock.                                     The
programme            stated       that        the gates would be opened         from       11.30
onwards            and     that     there      would be         entertainment   inside         the
ground.             The witness saw several people asking for tickets and
those        with         him previously had a spare that was sold within                           a
matter        of         seconds, and he said he could have sold                   it     twenty
times over, and from this he made the assumption that there was
a lot of people at the ground without tickets.


The     witness           went      into pen 3 at about 1.45 pm, and               told        the
Judge        in     response to his question that there was in                        fact      no
entertainment.              At about 2.30 (page 138G) this witness heard an
announcement              over the tannoy for supporters behind the goal at
the     Leppings           Lane end to actually move forward to                  let      other
supporters           onto the terracing.                 The witness commented that            in
his     opinion           that terracing was already fairly well                   populated
and he could not see how supporters could actually move forward
allowing other supporters in onto that terracing.


This        witness        states     that       shortly before 3.00        there        was    a
tremendous           surge downwards when he shot forward                   approximately
15     to     20     feet and ended about 10 feet away from                     the      fence.
There        was another surge about a minute later after which there
was no slack off and things got tighter and tighter.


This     witnesses evidence hereafter follows that which has                               been
given        by     previous witnesses at page 140G and-H, this                         witness
told     the        inquiry that apart from the tannoy message, that                           he
had     at        about     2.30,     did      not       hear   another   tannoy        message
                                        -   48 -


concerning the crowd, but did hear the team being                 announced.
He is able to hear the tannoy in this respect.


Cross examined by Mr Woodward who took him through his evidence
again        page    133E,    the witness said that in   response    to    the
tannoy message at 2.30 there did not appear to be any movement,
but     he     recalls thinking that there was no more room         to    move
forward anyway,   so presumably if people had             tried     to    move
forward they could not.


Cross     examined by Mr Glasgow the witness gave further evidence
about     the       tannoy.   The witness said that he did not have        any
difficulty          in hearing the tannoy at the time when he heard the
message       about     supporters moving up in the Leppings Lane         end,
but   when      the teams were announced the noise had increased            by
the crowd, and the tannoy was not clear then.              This     at    page
144C,D,E,F and G.


The witness would not be shaken on his evidence about the 2.30
tannoy announcement.

 Thomas          Kenith         Filten      lives        in     the   Waterloo        district          of
Liverpool.              He      attended       the       football match by            coach        in     a
private          party and had a ticket for the Leppings Lane                                standing
area.           He    had       attended the previous year.                    They   arrived           at
about 2.30. The coach parked near the Gateway supermarket and
it took five minutes to walk to the ground.


At     page 147B the witness states that the Police were                                    allowing
about          150 people through at a time outside the ground,                               "there
were      other        people running underneath the horses,                          and     that".
Page      147G the witness said that he did not have any difficulty
going through the turnstile.                       He did not give up his ticket, he
just   went            through        but     there       was     somebody       operating          the
turnstile.


Having gone through the tunnel this witness moved to his right.
At this stage in the transcript it is not clear precisely which
pen     he went into, but it become clear later.                               At page 149G             he
says that he went back out to look for his mates at the tunnel.
A.t    page 150 A,B,C he states that he originally went into peri' 2
and then went back and into pen 4 looking for his mates.                                          As he
Left     pen         2 and got to the tunnel there was a surge of                             people
coming         from the tunnel and he was able to get back into pen 4.
kt    page        150H he says that he left pen 4 after the                            match        was
adandoned he climbed over the fence at the front.


At    page        154E in response to cross examination by Mr                               Woodward
the     witness states that he only realised that something                                       auful
had     happened         when      he climbed over the fence and                      saw     a     few
people lying on the pitch inside the 6 yards area.


Cross         examined by Mr Glasgow at page 154F,G and H, the witness
states        that the first time he came down the tunnel and entered
                                              -   50 -


the     terrace        he    was      not   with his friends,    and        he     had     no
difficulty        in        finding     his way along the space        at        the     back
through       the gateway right through to pen 2.               After he had done
that        successfully        he    came back to look for his         friends          and
found       himself         in the entrance to the tunnel again.             He        there
met     a    wall of people all coming down together and the                       people
coming down in that group gathered him up with them and carried
him into the pen.


At    page 155A the witness states the time that he is caught                             up
with the rush of people coming out of the tunnel, neither he or
any    of those people had the time to spread along the back, and
that was the difference                     between the two   entrances           to     the
terraces made by him.

Nicholas        Bell, although he did not state it is from                       Liverpool
and     had visited Hillsborough on three previous occasions.                             He
did     not     attend the semi final the previous year 1988, but                         on
the     three       occasions that he had attended Hillsborough he                       had
been into the Leppings Lane terrace on each occasion.                             On those
previous        occasions he states that the ground had opened 1                         pen
and     the     Police,     when that is full,             direct     spectators       into
another       one     and   so      on until the         end.   On       those    previous
occasions       the     Police had been sectioning off                   different     pens
telling       spectators          to go to that one or this one.                 On   those
previous occasions it was the Police and stewards were doing 'it
as     well.The      witness stated that that had happened on each                        of
the three occasions that he had been there.                          Those       occasions
were just league games.


Cross     examined        by Mr Glasgow at page 156G, the                 witness     said
that he did not know whether the stewards who helped Police the
terraces       when the Liverpool fans came were Liverpool stewards.
I?he    witness      said    that he did know            that   Liverpool        stewards
tended to travel with Liverpool fans.                     At page 157A,B and C the
witness       stated    under       cross examination by            Mr    Glasgow     that
depending       at    which end of the ground the Liverpool fans                      are,
the     stewards, the whole reason for traveling with them, is                            to
go     with    the fans who know them.              The witness stated that              the
stewards       are    usually deployed on terraces rather than in                        the
stands,       and the witness had seem them at other grounds when he
had     attended at other grounds.                He had seen Liverpool stewards
there     but was not sure if they were Liverpool stewards when he
went    to    Sheffield       on     three other         occasions.        The    witness
accepted      that     it   is much easier for a Liverpool                  steward      to
organise Liverpool fans                than       it is for a       stewards      from    a
strange club to do it.

 This        witness      more       or     less insisted on            being         called.     The
 witness        stated          that he had a ticket for the North stand.                          He
 referred        to     gate A, the gate on the very left hand                            side    and
 referred        to it as the concertina gate.                       That was the gate that
 he     had managed to got through.                      The witness went through                that
gate with noone checking tickets.                          He arrived at those gates at
about        7 or 8 minutes to 3.                 He said the bulk of the crowd                   was
in front of him then, but there was still people coming up from
behind        and when he saw how busy it was there he looked to                                  the
left and the back gate was open and an auful lot of people went
through that gate on the left.                          The witness joined them.


The witness was crossed examined by Mr Woodward and the witness
described         the procedures in 1988 with Police checking                                 tickets
at     the     temporary barrier about 100 yards from the                               gate.      Mr
Woodward suggested to the witness that he was mistaken                                          about
that but he stuck to his point.


Cross        examined       by Mr Glasgow at page 159F and G, the                          witness
told        the inquiry that he had a ticket for the North stand, and
said that when he got through the opened gate and to the actual
stand itself there were two Police Officers at the steps,                                        two
stewards and a Policewoman.


Under        further cross examination by Mr Glasgow the witness said
that        the two stewards at the top of the stairs actually inside
the stand, and in total there was probably about 4 people there
on     a two and a half to three foot entrance.                               At page 160 A,B,C
and     D     the witness states that he saw fans forcing                              their     way
through        and     under the Police Officers extended arms,                            in    the
stand        because      the game just at that second, as he got to                             the
top     of    those       steps       going into the stand                   kicked    off.      The
witness        said     that the two stewards were looking at the                              match
                                   -   53 -


and    they   were    actually inside the stands, so they     were   not
trying to stop anybody from getting in.       The Police were trying
to    stop    fans.   The Police had extended arms, and     the   Police
lady was trying to stop someone from getting in.          The fans were
pushing their way underneath the arms and past her.


At    page 160F re-examined by Mr Collins the witness agreed that
the Policewoman tried to stop him although he had a ticket, but
when he showed her his ticket she let him go past.


The inquiry was adjourned until 10.00 am the following morning.

                      VOLUME 2 OF DAC BUNDLE OF TRANSCRIPTS

 Thursday 18th Mav 1989 Morning Session


 The proceedings were opened by Lord Justice Taylor                            making        a
 statement concerning the press.


This was followed by Mr Collins stating that the witnesses that
were     now     to     be    called    were put        forward    by    the    Football
Supporters Association, and the statements upon which they were
being        examined    were     not taken by West         Midlands       Police       but
either voluntered or taken by the Solicitors for the                                various
organisations concerned.


I     propose to deal with these witnesses as briefly as possible,
but will point out any matters I consider to be relevant.

Witness Trevor Hicks


Trevor        Hicks lives in the Greater London area and he, his wife
and     two    daughters        are    supporters of       Liverpool.          They    had
tickets        for the semi final at Hillsborough.                 His wife had        one
seat in the North stand, his daughters were                          given      standing
tickets and he was given a standing ticket.


This     witness       stated     that he did not see any signs                of    drink
around.       He did not see any mounted Police.                  He was not stopped
by     the    Police     at     any stage.       They    arrived    at    about       2.00
o clock and it was fairly quiet. Inside the ground he saw                              two
stewards selling programmes.


He saw a sign directly above tunnel that said "standing".


This   witness' attention was drawn to                        photograph        14     and
indicated a small sign saying "standing".


At    page 8C and D this witness refers to seeing Policemen going
                                                   -    55 -


 to     and fro from the Police control box.                           One Officers stood on
 the        landing looking out into the general area of pens 3 and 4,
 and        this    witness with others tried to draw his                         attention     to
     what    was        going on".        it appears that he spoke to the                  Police
 Officer or tried to speak to the Police Officer at about                                     2.55
 pm, just before kick off.


 This       witness          at    page    11F observed          the    television       cameras
 pointed          not    towards the pitch but down towards the pens.                          At
 page       12F     this      witness appears to tell the inquiry                    that     the
 response he received                     from a Police Officer            was     "shut    your
 fucking prattle".


The     main       force          of   this witness'           evidence    is     towards     the
confusion           which         took    place        amongst    the     Police,     Firemen,
Ambulancemen in dealing with the injured people on the pitch.


It should be remembered that both of his daughters were injured
to some extent and were taken onto the pitch.


Cross examined by Mr King at page 16A this witness is                                    highly
critical of the sign posting within the ground.


At     page 16D this witness says that he had no difficulty at all
in      forming the view that people in the pen were in                              distress,
and     he put the time of that at 2.45 pm, possibly even earlier.
At      page 17this witness states that it was quite clear to                                 him
that the Police thought it was a pitch invasion when in fact it
was     quite       clear to anybody else that it was really people                           in
distress trying to get                      out.        The witness       Hicks    was     cross
examined by Mr Woodward.


Mr     Woodward took this witness again through his evidence.                                 At
page 18C this witness says that he did not hear an announcement
about moving or crowd control.                         He said that he did not hear an
announcement            at    2.30 pm for Liverpool fans to move back.                        Mr
Woodward then corrected himself and said "the Liverpool fans at
                                   -   56 -


the     back    of the goal should move forward, because there       were
people at the back to come in."          The witness confirmed that he
did not hear this.


There    was considerable discussion as to the description of the
Police Officer, the senior Police Officer this            witness     had
endeavoured to speak to.


This    witnesses evidence in my opinion does not add anything to
that    which    has   gone before and I have   not   therefore     drawn
attention to anything other than that which I have stated here.

Ian William Burke lives in Skelmersdale in Lancs.                              This witness
entered        the ground at about quarter past to half past one, and
did     not     have any difficulty getting through                      the   turnstiles.
There       were only four or five people in the queue.                         He with his
friends        did not go down the tunnel, but went to the right hand
side.         The    witness thinks it is B section.                    To pens 1      and       2
near     to the Police control box.                    They had their backs           against
the     wall.        Later      this witness and one friend went                   into    the
middle        section       and went into pen 4.                 At page 3IS the      witness
describes        a       sudden crush at         about the time when           the    players
came     out onto         the pitch.         At page        33B thiswitness says          that
he     climbed to the top of the                 fence and a woman Police            Officer
came     over       to    him     and said       "get back in",         but    the   witness
continued to climb over out of the terrace.                            She was       standing
on the tack.


At     page     34E this witness states that he saw his friend                         climb
over     the fence and then a Police Officer escorted them into                              a
section through a gate in the corner, the North corner.


Cross    examined          by Mr Woodward this witness was taken                     through
his evidence again.              This did not appear to add anything at all
to the general evidence given by many previous witnesses.

Witness William Hamilton Comerford
'Volume 2 of DAC bundle of transcripts


William      Hamilton    Comerford is a manager of a Public House          by
occupation and arrived at Leppings Lane at about 2.30 pm.                  He
had attended the previous year.


At    page    4IB    the witness states that   one   mounted     Policeman
shouted      "stop   pushing there is nowhere to go".      The        Officer
said this a number of times.        The witness went into the back of
pen   4.      Cross examined by Mr Jackson the witness agreed           that
the   front     gate of the pens was totally inadequate,         it    would
only fit one person at a time through the gate.


Cross examined by Mr Woodward he was taken through his evidence
again.   This witness did not in my opinion show anything which
adds to the evidence already described.

Witness Diane Susan Connolly
Volume 2        of DAC transcript bundle page 49


Diane      Susan       Connolly is a nurse and lives     in Liverpool.          She
went to the match by coach and arrived in Sheffield at 12.45pm.


At      page     50B this witness states that on the way to          Sheffield
the coach was stopped by Police by a roundabout and everyone on
the      coach       produced their tickets but they were     not     checked.
There      was no alcohol on board.         The coach parked a quarter           of
an      hours    walk     from the ground and she went straight          to     the
ground.          She    had a ticket for the terrace B     turnstile.           She
and      her friends waited for other friends by a wall oposite the
turnstiles to meet them by arrangement at 2.00 pm.               After about
10      minutes she and her friends had moved to the other side                 .pf
the      road, and they then waited inside the gates out of the way
of      everyone, where the Police then came over and told them                  to
get in in no uncertain terms.            This was at 1.10 pm.       At 1.15 pm
she     went     into     the   ground with her friends.     They    went        in
through        the     turnsile.   At that time they were three       or      four
mounted Policemen and some Policemen on foot.


l?his    witness        did not see any tickets being sold      outside         the
ground,        but     as they were walking down people were asking             for
spare tickets, but she did not see any swapping.             She was asked
Lf she had any spare tickets three or four times.


Once inside the ground she stood with her friends just in front
of the tunnel waiting for other friends to arrive.


A.t   page      5 IF    this witness states that she saw about       7     or     8
stewards        at the bottom of the steps leading to the stands, who
were talking and checking a few tickets.            Checking people going
up to the stands.


At    page 51H this witness states that she saw one of the                 outer
gates     opened       while she was there, there was a steward on            the
                                           -   60 -


gate,        on that gate and he was letting a few Policemen in,                     and
he     let     a few others in.         The witness assumed,that the           others
were     stewards.          A couple of them had distinctive jackets on                a
couple of them did not.               The timing of this was about 1.45               pm
to 2.00 pm.


They     decided       to     go   in at 2.15 and went to the         end     of     the
tunnel        and went to the right.           At page 52C this witness states
that     at     quarter past 2 she was able to walk straight                  through
the     tunnel       but when she came to the end it was packed to                   the
back.        Once this witness was in pen 3 she was unable to get out
although she tried to, she was just pushed to the                       front,        in
front of the front barrier.


At     page 52F the witness was asked by Lord Justice Taylor                       wher
she     was when she made the decision that she wanted to go                        back
"how     far     in were you".        To this the witness answered "we               had
just     gone into the tunnel and out of the other end."                    She     was
stopped        at that stage from going back to the tunnel, she                     just
got     pushed over it was too crowded to turn, she tried to                        turn
round to go out.             The witness says however that there was not a
flow     through the tunnel but having gone a little to the                        right
and     having decided she wanted to get out she then got                     crushed
and pushed over, and could not turn round.


At    page     53D     the    witness    states       that   after   2.45     pm     she
remembered       seeing the teams run out onto the pitch and she was
then pushed forward and never went back again, but kept getting
pushed       forward.        She has no recall of anything on           the    pitch
after that.          This witness was thrown by two men over the spiked
fence to the right into pen number 2.


At page 55A the witness states that she saw a pile of people on
top     of    each     other just in front of the            crash   barrier       that
eventually collapsed.              She did not see that collapse.


It    would appear that pen 2 was not unduly crowded because this
                                                 -   61 -


 witness         says     at page 55D "we made our way down to                the     front
 gate       in    that pen (pen 2), but could not get out because                      they
 were bringing the dead and injured past us, and onto the pitch
 so we waited for five to ten minutes.


This witness gives some fairly clear evidence about the gate in
-the     perimeter fence to pen 3, at page 55F.                     She says the       gate
was opened two or three times, but the first couple of time it
got shut again by the Policeman.


The     first          time it opened it was opened by the people                at    the
front just by pushing on it.                     From the pen side.     She could see
them leaning on it, pushing it, trying to get it open.                          At that
time        there       was   a    Police Officer on the other          side    of     the
perimeter fence.              She saw the Police Officer kick the gate shut
again.            She saw a couple of people get out, but it                   was shut
again.This at page 56A.                   At page 56B she says that            the third
time        the Police Officer must have realised what was                    happening
because          he     opened it and people started to get out then.                   It
was     a        male Police        Officer      and the    same    officer     on each
occasion.             The Police Officers were then helping to pull people
out.


ht     page 56G this witness says that she had not expected to see
a side fence when she came out of the tunnel.                        She just thought
she     could         go through the tunnel and then spread out once                   she
g'ot    inside the ground.                So far as she could see there were            no
other       entrances.            Prompted by Counsel she said that if               those
side fences              had not been there she felt everyone             could       have
spread out.


The     witness was cross examined by Mr Jackson.                    At page 57D        in
cross       examination           the witness says that during the time               that
she was amongst the supporters she did not see any incidents of
violence         or disorder, drunkenness or the like.                She also        said
that    during          the   time        she   was outside   the    ground     in    the
immediately            facinity      of    the turnstiles she did not          see    any
                                  -   62 -


incident of disorderly behaviour at all.


The     witness Connerly was cross examined by Mr Woodward at page
58A,B     and C.   The response to cross examination by Mr Woodward
this witness said that she became concerned for her safety at a
time    when   the team/an out onto the pitch to start    the   game.
The barrier which broke was just to her left        and    a    little
behind her, about 3 yards.

 Witness: Peter J. Garrett
 Volume II of DAC Transcript Bundle - Page 58


 The    witness,           Peter Garrett/ is a Police Constable                with        the
Merseyside Police and has been for some 11 years.                              He     is     a
Liverpool supporter.


He      is     Membership           Secretary    for   the    Football     Supporters
Association and was co-founder of that organisation.


He     attended the match with a Rogan Taylor, Peter Jackson                           and
______________  PeterJackson and Rogan Taylor are Officials of
the Football Supporters Association,             |is not.


He     arrived outside the Leppings Lane entrance at between 2.15
and     2.25        p.m.     At that time he saw a lot of           people      milling
about        mainly in the ante-area between the turnstiles and                        the
large        blue gates.        He estimated that the number of people                     in
that     area        were     in excess of 1,000.          He saw 3 or     4    mounted
Police        Officers        on Leppings Lane on the roadway and when                     he
joined        the     throng of people to enter the turnstiles for                     the
North        Stand     he     saw    2 foot Police     Officers        alongside       the
turnstiles.          He was making for the turnstiles for the entrance
to     the    North         Stand.    It took him about 30 minutes             to     gain
entrance       to the Ground and he went through the turnstiles                            at
about 2.50 p.m. When he joined the throng he was only                                 just
inside the perimeter gate.


This     witness said that there were more and more people coming
behind       him arriving by the minute, younger people and females
were getting in distress in the crush and people were shouting
 Stop    pushing,           stop     pushing."      This     witness    thought        the
movement       in     the     crowd     was     involuntary     -   they   were       not
deliberately pushing but the sheer volume of people caused the
condensing of bodies and almost involuntary movement.
                                              -   64 -




 At     page     60 A he told Mr. Goldsack who was examining                    him     in
 chief that the 2 Police Officers by the turnstiles                                   were
 incapable of doing anything even if they wanted to.


At     page     60 C this witness told the Court that                  the     previous
year     there was certainly more orderly queuing which was being
organised        both        by Police and Stewards.        He did not         see     any
Stewards        outside the Ground this year.              At page 60 E he           told
the Inquiry that once he had got through the turnstiles he was
surprised to see a large number of Police Officers in the area
leading        from     the turnstiles that he had gone through to                    the
back of the North Stand.                 He identified the position on a plan
at     the     Inquiry.        He estimated the number of Police              Officers
at     that     point        in excess of 30.       At page 61    B    the     witness
states        that he drew attention to one group of Police Officers
inside        the turnstiles to the difficulties that were going                       on
outside        the     turnstiles and either a Sergeant or a                 Constable
said "It's nowt to do with us." He was                            sure       that     the
Sergeant inside the turnstiles had a radio.


This     witness        made     his way to the North Stand where              he     saw
Stewards        on his approach to the Stand (page 61 E).                    They     did
not     check his ticket as he went into the Stand.                    On page 61 F
he says that about 3 p.m. there were 3 young men in his row in
the     North        Stand     who clearly did not       have    the    appropriate
tickets        and     after     an altercation they moved away              into     the
gangway.        At      page     62 B he says that at the         kick-off          stage '
there     were more people standing in the gangways,than he would
have     thought        normal        for kick-off time.    At page      63     B     the
witness         states         that     in the North Stand, as he            went      up
the     steps        from    the passageway underneath the            Stand,        there
were     2 Stewards at the top of those steps but he did not                          see
an7 Steward attempting to move the people who were                            standing
in the seated area.
                                                      -    65 -




 From       his position in the North Stand he saw that the 2 centre
 sections          of       the     terrace          were        grossly      over-crowded.            At
page 63 E          the witness says there was obvious confusion on the
pitch        and       at 63 F he says that he could not understand                                  what
the        Authorities         were doing because it appeared to                             him     that
people          were     trying to climb over the top of the                               fences     and
dependent on how far over the fence they were they were either
being       told       to     go back or being helped over.                         This     at     page
63 F.   He observed a series of openings and closings of                                             the
gates on the pitch perimeter.


The        witness        Garrett         was        cross-examined            by     Mr.      Jackson
commencing          at      page 64 B who took him through his journey                                to
th.e Ground, to a visit to the Freemasons Arms where he says he
saw        no     public       disorder,             he    saw     no    hooliganism           at    the
turnstiles          and       at     page 64 F he expressed the                       opinion       that
there       was a disproportionate amount of Police Officers inside
compared          with      the      immediate area               outside       the     turnstiles.
Mr. Jackson            drew from this witness an apology for having said
to     a    Police Officer, after the abandonment of the                                    game,     "I
think you are a party to a murder."                               This at page 65 C.


Commencing          at      page 65 F this witness was                        cross-examined          by
Mr. Woodward.                 At     page       66    B     this       witness        states        that
throughout          the       entire        afternoon, by his                 observation,          from
2.25 p.m. to 4 p.m. he felt that there were a number of Police
Officers,          either          because they were not directed                      or      because
they       were     not inclined or because they did not know what                                    to
dOf who did nothing.                  It related to the whole event.


Mr. Woodward took this witness through his connection with the
Football           Supporters            Association             and    the    fact        that     that
Association            tried       to encourage orderly conduct                       of     football
supporters.              At       page     69    G        this    witness       says        that     the
supporters,  some of them, were saying "Let's not push.                                             Come
on, ease off." and that sort of thing.
                                                -   66 -




 Mr.     Woodward suggested that even the fans were not heeded                             by
 their     colleagues            but the witness said that (page 70 A)                   just
 the     sheer       volume and numbers of people make it                a     situation
 that     is neither avoidable nor unavoidable.                   It just      happens.
 It     just     occurs.         This witness personally was trying to                   hold
back as he reached the turnstiles to give a little                            breathing
space to some youngsters.


This     witness           saw    people urinated against the          wall        in    the
enclosure,           just     the     other side of the Programme            Kiosk       but
nowhere        near        the tunnel.     He did not see the tunnel area                 at
aLl.     Only after the game when he was coming out.


The   witness Garrett was                      cross-examined     by   Mr.         Glasgow
commencing at page 71 G.


The witness agreed that the control of Stand seating is rather
easier than terracing.                The witness accepted that with a Stand
seat     a Steward can actually show a supporter physically where N
his     row     and the seat is.           At page 72 B the       witness          recalls
seeing        2 Stewards when he went up the staircase to the                        Stand
but does not recall seeing any Police Officers at that point.


At     page 72 C the witness describes the inpracticability of                             a
Police        Officer chasing somebody who had pushed past a                        Police
Officer        into        the Stand.     At page 72 H the witness            re-states
that     there        were       people standing in the aisles         who         had    no
business        to        be there.     At page 73 C this witness            was    asked
about     possible           criticism of the Stewards if they               failed       to
control        peoplein the Stand and what in                 this witness's            view
Police        Officers and/or Stewards              could doat that stage in the
game     if     a     quantity of fans simply ignored them               and       forced
their     way        past.       The witness answered "I would           think          that
there     is     very        little that they can do.         What the       situation
needs     is        for      everbody     to    be sat down     and then      you        can
identify       within        the seating area where the problem is.                      You
try     to keep track of where people dodge around.                    The 3        young
                                              -    67 -




 fellows       that were alongside me were perhaps 16 or 17 years of
 age.   At that age they are quite adept at getting into places
 I can assure you."


This witness            used     to   police        both    Liverpool        and     Everton
matches.


At       page 73 F,in response to Mr. Glasgow's                      cross-examination
he       said that         once the match is under way,              at least       in    the
Stand        areas, those who have been outside, those serials                           that
have     been outside which are moved inside under the control of
their’ Sergeants, can deal with identifiable areas where there
are people           who    should      not be once         the     sitting    down      has
started.


At       page 73 G the witness was asked whether during the                           stage
when     the fans       are moving into the Stands particularly,                      there
is     almost nothing that the Stewards and the Police can do                             if
their        physical      presence     and       their     oral    instructions         are
physically        ignored.        The    witness answered "No               because      you
can't leave your post as it were.                       If you are checking tickets
and people coming through and 2 or 3 or 4 people run past what
you normally find is people try to get into the Stands without
tickets       almost       like guerilla tactics.             They will       infiltrates
one     at a time rather than in groups but they will all get                             in
or     try    to get in.        That occurs in the Stands where there                     is
numbered seating and of course on the terracing there is                                 not
even numbered seating.


At     page 74 B this witness stated that he, as a Policeman, was
more aware of the probability of people trying to get into the
terraced       areas without tickets because of the total anonimity
there.        The Police are more vigilant for people trying to get
in to the terraced areas rather than the Stands.                            At page 75 D
this     witness      was      asked by M r . Glasgow to            assume     that      the
decision        to    open      the   gate        was     totally    bona     fide       and
understandable          and    the witness said that he               would        probably
                                              -    68 -




have done the same thing in the same circumstances.                               This in a
situation        that he agreed that it resulted in waves of                         scores
and     probably           hundreds    of    people       coming    in     when    it        was
impossible for individual Officers or Stewards to control them
once     they were in.             On page 76 this witness speaks about                      the
organisation           of previous years and the possibility that                        this
year     the     crowd        could have been         more   effectively          filtered
towards the Ground and their tickets checked.                         Mr. Glasgow put
to     this witness at page 76 F and G that if the outer gate was
going     to     be        opened with the resultant mass             entrance          of     a
large     number           of fans a warning would have been -given by                       the
Police     Officers opening that gate to the Officers inside                                 the
turnstiles           and    the    witness        responded that      he     would      have
thought     that it would have been the first communication                              from
outside     to       inside        "I am now going to open           this     gate.          Be
ready."         He would have thought that would have been the                          very
first     message          that    would have been relayed.               Failing       that
message     the       witness agreed there would be nothing                      that    the
Stewards        or    Police Officers inside could do to                    contain      the
situation.           This     at    page 76 H.       At page 77       D    the     witness
states that before opening the outer gate perhaps there should
have     been     a line of Police Officers or the gates across                          the
tunnel     closed          or some form of barrier to ensure that                   nobody
else     went    down        the    tunnel    to an       area     that    was     already
congested.           At page 77 E Mr. Glasgow made the point, and                        the
witness     accepted it, that it was essential that those on                             the
inside knew what was about to be done from the outside.


At the end of this witness's evidence the Inquiry                                adjourned
for lunch.

Witness: David Hartley
V o lu m e I I    o f DAC T r a n s c r i p t B u n d l e
Thursday,         1 8 t h May,       1989 - A fte r n o o n S e s s i o n


The     witness, David Hartley, lives in Nelson in Lancashire and
gave evidence: concerning an incident on the way to the match
when he was travelling by motorcar.


This witness's entire evidence related to a Policeman changing
the     position          of     a     direction board at                a   roundabout   which
traffic          came     to     after        leaving the             A61.    The   implication
appears          to     me to be that the Police might have, for a                        time,
muddled motorists by the bad placing of a direction board.


Mr.    Woodward was not ready to cross-examine this witness                                 and '
L.J.       Taylor          said        that     if       he     was     in   difficulty   over
cross-examination witnesses could be recalled.

Witness: Thomas Bentley Matthews
Volume II of DAC bundle of Transcripts - Page 80


Thomas       Bentley Matthews comes from North Wales.                 He    attended
the     match and had attended the previous year, he had a ticket
for     the Leppings Lane standing through B entrance but did not
manage       to      get in through the right place for          the       entrance.
He     found      himself queuing in the entrance to            the    turnstiles
marked C.            At page 81 F the witness stated, being examined by
Mr.     Goldsack,        that by turnstile C there was a Policeman                  who
physically           was unable to do anything.         This witness's           friend
was     asked        by the Steward at the turnstile why he was                  coming
in     turnstile        C and it was explained that effectively he                  had
had     no     choice.        His friend was allowed through as            was     this
witness        who     physically tore his own ticket and passed it                  to
the     Steward.         This    witness went through the        tunnel.           This
witness        knew the Ground and knew that there was access to the
standing        area     if     he went through the tunnel and         also        knew
there were           entrances on the sides, apart from the tunnel                   to
the stands.


At     page 82 E this witness states that the previous year                        they
had     been      directed to go through the sides.            This    year        they
received       no     direction     and    assumed     that   there    was        room.
(Presumably room at the other end of the tunnel).


The     witness       said that the previous year there was a line                   of
Policemen         in front of the tunnel telling supporters not to go
in     because       obviously     the place was full at the          time.        The
previous       year that had taken place at about 2.55 p.m. - later
than his entering the Ground this year.


This     witness finished up in Pen 4 behind a crush barrier.                       It
was    before        kick-off, the crowd was very compact and                he    saw
people       crushed against the barrier in some pain.                There       then
came     a    sudden     surge and this witness was carried                past    the
barrier      down to the front.           He managed to grab the fence             and
                                                    -   71 -




dragged        himself        over it by climbing over.                     Nobody         tried         to
stop     him       doing that at that stage.                    He had to throw               himself
ov-er    the       angled         part    of       the fence      and       he     landed          on     a
Policeman.            This    witness helped with the injured.                             At       some
stage         he    was      in    the        Gymnasium        area    where          Doctors           had
gathered.          He saw a fireman bring oxygen cylinders in and                                       one
was brought to a Doctor and found to be empty. This at                                              page
84 D.                                          -


Cross-examined            by Mr. King this witness said that the Doctors
organised          the    situation very well.                  The witness agreed                  that
there was lack of organisation by the Police throughout.


Witness        Matthews       was then cross-examined by Mr. Jackson                                    who
took     this witness through his experiences attending the match
the       previous year.             This evidence concerning                     the      previous
Year       related to fans being filtered                         along very slowly towards
the    entrance and               the turnstiles.              This at page           85      of        the
transcript.


The     witness was then questioned concerning the marking on his
ticket        which      related         to    B    turnstile         and    at       page         86    B
Mr. Jackson made a point with the witness that turnstile A was
not     followed         by turnstile B but instead by turnstile C.                                     At
page     86    G     this witness says that having got                           to     the     wrong
turnstile          his    friend         was told "Go through               and       go      right." N
Concerning          the previously alleged slowness of the                              turnstiles
at     page 87 C the witness Matthews says "The only reason I can
say     that       we went through slower than normal was                             because           my
matewas checked in front of me.                                Myself, I         moved      through
quicker than he did."


The     witness Matthews was then cross-examined by Mr.                                    Woodward
who     took       him through his experience attending the match                                   the
previous year and then his comparison with his experience this
year.
                                             -    72 -




The     witness       was       absolutely       firm that there         were,      say,     5
Police       Officers barring the mouth of the tunnel the                          previous
year when he entered through the turnstiles at about 2.55 p.m.


The     witness           was   cross-examined           by   Mr.     Glasgow     who      put
photographs          to     this   witness from the            bundle    called         "West
Midlands       2".        At    page   91        he   was     taken     by   way     of the
photographs          through        his approach to           the turnstiles and            into
the tunnel. At page    92 B the witness said that he did notsee
the Notice Board which says "Standing" on it.


At    page     92 D and E the witness said that the design                         of      the
terracing       was what almost any experienced football                         supporter
would        expect       and       the thing         that    this    witness      had not
anticipated until he saw it was the vertical pen fences.

 W itn e ss:    David Thomas Jones
 Volume II of DAC bundle of Transcripts - Page 92
 Thursday, 18th May, 1989 - Afternoon Session


Examined         by    Mr. Philips.        The witness, David           Thomas     Jones,
comes      from Preston, Lancas-hire and he attended the match this
year      arriving          in   Sheffield about 11.30 a.m.             He went    to        a
Public         House    and had a few drinks before the                 match.     About
 1L.50     he managed to find a pub.                He does not know the name of
it.      It was within 5 minutes' walk of the Ground.                      The pub was
not      open to the general public but they knocked on the                        front
door,      somebody opened the door, saw there were only a few                           of
them and then let them in.                 Inside it was quite crowded, about
20 0     - 300 people.           Exclusively Liverpool supporters.               He left
the pub about 2.10.               He only had 2 bottles of Newcastle Brown.
Others         in the pub were still drinking and having a good time.
He     had a ticket for the match.                 His was for the Leppings Lane
end     and     his 3 friends with him were all in the North                      Stand.
They had gone to a local chip shop for something to eat.                               They
arrived        at     the Leppings Lane entrance at about 2.35.                    There
were     masses        of people.      He estimated between 3,000 -               4,000.
The     witness        mentioned      queue       but said that it       was     not    an
orderly        line     -     it was just a mass of            people   jostling       for
general        position.         He saw 2 mounted Policemen.            They were not
doing     a     great deal.         They were unsuccessfully trying to                 get
the     mass of people into some semblance of order.                      He did       not
see     any foot Policemen.            He saw 1 or 2 children in the crowd.
He     said that parents were trying to pass the children over to
get     them     out     of      the main body of        the    queue    outside       the
Leppings Lane end.               The children were being passed over to the
right     hand side where there was a little wall.                      The    children
were just being passed to the side out of the crush, while the
parents        were staying in the crush, slowly moving towards                        the
turnstiles.            Witness     Jones    got to a turnstile           about     2.55.
Once     he got through the turnstile he was more or less                         forced
through it and did not have a chance to get his stub back.
                                                 -    74 -




 This     witness went first to the general toilets and from there
 he moved on towards the main body of the tunnel with a view to
 getting out onto the terracing.                      He did not see any gates open
 at     any time.             He went through the tunnel.            He did not see any
 Police       Officers or Stewards in the yard between the turnstile
 and the tunnel. Conditions in the tunnel were reasonable. He
 was able to walk down it and he could see the pitch as he went
 down     the tunnel and at that time could see players warming up
 and     getting             ready for the off.        Once through the          tunnel     he
 just tried to get to the best standing position he could find.
 He went to the right hand side after going through the tunnel.
 He     was       virtually         behind the goal.          He was either in       Pen        3
 or 4.        He does not know for sure.                 it was the first pen            that
 he     came to.             The witness was shown photograph 21 and said                  he
 went     to the right hand side of the fence shown                       in that photo­
 graph.       He        looked      at photograph 23.          He said     that     he    was
 virtually             behind the right hand goal post as he looked at the
 picture,          about       3/4 of the way up.            That is where he       started
 off.        He        did    not   see   a barrier at         all   until       after    the
incident.              He     said the pen was chock-a-block.                  Things,    the
pressure,          got from bad to worse.               it was difficult for him to
breathe       and this witness was pushed a good half way down                            the
terracing.             He said everybody all around him was screaming for ''
the Police to open the gate.                 This witness got turned round so
that     he was facing the stands                    above him and       could only hear
screams           from behind him then.              He saw peoplebeing dragged up
from      the terracing overinto the stands above.                        That terrible
sort      of crush            lasted   about 10       minutes.       Eventually      this
witness           got out       through    the        gate in     the    middle     of    the
perimeter fencing when it was eventually opened and he managed
to jump out and get onto the pitch.                      This evidence is at about
page 97 and 98 of the transcript.


At    page        99     C    this witness is asked whether               he    heard any
announcements                over the loudspeaker system to which he said he
heard an announcement from the tannoy, probably about a couple
of    minutes before he managed to make his way through the gate
                                                -   75 -




     (onto the pitch) and heard something come over the loudspeaker
     telling       people to get off the field, to get off the pitch, to
     get    back      off the pitch.         People at that time          were     spilling
     over        by the hundreds andgetting over the perimeter fence                       as
    quickly as they could, every direction they                           could,    either
    through the gate or any way they could.


    Witness D.T. Jones was cross-examined by Mr. Woodward.


    The     witness Jones was cross-examined about the merrymaking in
    the closed pub after he went on to go to the Ground, about his
    arrival        at the Ground and the enormous crowd of people.                       This
!   witness        had    been at the match the year before and he                  had     a
    stand          seat and he got tothe Ground about 2.50 that year.                      At
    page100 C this witness effectively                     says that there is little
    or     no     difference between this year and last year                 apparently
    meaning the organisation.               In response to what was effectively
    an      attack       on     the    behaviour    of     the   crowd    outside         the
    turnstiles,          this     witness    at page 100 F said          everybody        was
    fending for themselves, trying to get through as quickly                               as
    possible to try and get out of the crush.


    This witness, in his Statement, had used the expression "using
    brute        force to get through".         He described his form of                brute
    force        as being "I just generally get in the queue and try and
    get     to    the     front       as quickly as      possible   without        harming
    anybody."           This    at    page 100 G.     At page 101 F        the     witness
    admits       that if he had wanted to it was free enough for him to
    be     able to turn round and come back, having got to the end of
    the tunnel and seeing the state of the terrace. 'At page 101 H
    the     witness      effectively says that he pushed forward                   to    get
    into position through the crowd.                He did not intend staying at
    the back of the crowd.


    This    witness       told Counsel that when he had come through                     the
    turnstiles he             went    to the toilet and had no           difficulty       in
    finding it.

The    witness then made the gratuitous statement to the Inquiry
that    he   put   the   cause   of the disaster   down   to   lack   of
co-ordination and control outside by the Police and lack              of
stewarding within Hillsborough.

T hursday,        1 8 t h M ay,   1989 - A f t e r n o o n     S essio n


Examined by Mr. Goldsack.                   Paul McCaffrey is a resident of The
Wirral.          He visited a Public House before going to the Ground.
He had 2k pints and left the pub about 2.20 - 2.25.                                 He was at
the     match          the    previous      year.        As he left the pub          3     or     4
supporters             were     entering the pub but he said they                   were        the
only other supporters in there.                         This witness initially joined
the    mass           outside     the turnstiles but then climbed                   over        the
fencing alongside the river bank with his friend.


He     had apparently gone through the outer perimeter gates, had
been     heading towards the turnstiles, then made his way across
to     the right and over the fence by the side of the river.                                   He
had     seen other supporters doing the same thing and                              followed.
The    witness looked at photograph 5 of West Midlands 1                                  bundle
and    questioned with the photograph at page 104 E said that he
must     have gone over the fence before the perimeter.                              At     page
10 4   F the witness says that his intention had been to go over
the    fence           along the side and then back over the                      fence,     and
that     was          in fact what he did.              He came back over the             fence,
very     close to the turnstiles, more or less alongside.                                 He was
directly opposite Gate C when he came back over the fence.                                      At
that     time          "the    gate"     was open.            He did not    see     it     being
opened.           He was one of the first people through the gate.                              He
then     headed          for the tunnel.              He knew the Ground          quite     well
haying        been there quite a few times previously, he knew there
were     other ways onto the terrace but went through the                                 tunnel
because          he     had every intention of standing where he did                         the
previous         year.        He and his friend both stopped in the                       tunnel
and both urinated on the tunnel walls.                            At that time there was
a    line        of people all doing the same thing along the side                              of
the tunnel, along both sides.                     He went into Pen 3.             Having got
into     the          crowd   the witness says he was pushed                 against         the
last    barrier           between the fence at the front and                  themselves,
                                                 -   78 -




    the barriers closest to the perimeter fence.                      He was not aware
    that      there was also a fence at the side of the pen.                          He        said
    he     was      standing by the barrier that snapped.                  This       at        page
    10 6 D.         He     could see the gate in the perimeter fence to                          his „
    left.         When      first in a position behind the barrier he,                          with
    his     friend, climbed under it.                He then stood with the barrier
    behind        his back.         At page 107 A he says that in front of                       the
    barrier there was still a lot of barrier on him and his friend
    and within minutes the barrier snapped.                     He heard a loud crack
    and     the      barrier        hit    him on his left leg.           He    was        pushed
    forward.          People behind him fell face forward onto the floor.
    The     witness says there were some Policemen on the other                                 side
y   of the perimeter fence and people were trying to attract their
    attention            shouting       help, let us out.      He thinks only he                 and
    his     friend         were shouting that a barrier had               collapsed.             At
    page      107     G the witness says that he saw the perimeter                             fence
    open      twice but the Police closed it on each occasion.                             It was
    the     same Policeman that closed it on each occasion.                           He       does
    not     know      when it opened the third time.               He and       his        friend
    were      trapped       by their legs with bodies.             At page 108             D    the
    witness         estimates       that     about     20 or   possibly        more        people
    appeared to have fallen as a result of the barrier collapsing.
    He does not know whether any of the people who fell                                forward
    were able to get up at all.


    The    witness         McCaffrey was cross-examined by Mr. Woodward                          at
    page      109    who        took him through his evidence             again       and       the
    witness         said    he     saw     uniformed    Officers     on     foot      by        the
    turnstiles, quite a number of them.                     At page 110 B the witness
    says     that when he climbed back over the fence on his way into
    the    Ground,         if    the gate had not been opened he               would           have
    thrust       himself         into     the people waiting to      go        through          the
    turnstiles.            At    page 110 F the witness says that he did                        not
    know     where        the    lavatories were but having          gone        along          the
    tunnel,         if he had chosen at that stage to go back and out                            of
    it, he could have done so.                At page 111 D the witness said, in
    cross-examination,              that    he was intent,       notwithstanding                the
                                          -   79 -




state     of what was plain for him to see and for his friend                        to
see,     to     make his way onto that particular terrace.                    It    was
possible        by just pushing through and he was not the only                     one
doing     it.     At page 112 B the witness says that he did not                     at
any     stage     see anyone jumping up and down or standing on                     the
barrier        that failed.      At page 113 C the witness says that                 he
did not hear any public address telling people not to join the
crowd outside the Leppings Lane terrace turnstiles or from any
Police vehicle.


The     witness       was cross-examined by Mr. Glasgow.- The                 witness
was     shown photograph No. 17 in the blue bundle.                   The     witness
agreed that in the picture 3 toilets (2 gents, and 1                          ladies)
were clearly indicated.


At     page     113     F the witness says that it was not            always        the
inability        to know where the toilets were which caused him and
others        to urinate in the tunnel.           The witness would not agree
that     it was almost bravado that caused it but desperation and
to the Judge he agreed                  that it      was   probably     the       least
deviation from his route.


In     cross-examination         the   witness agreed that        the       probable
deviation would have been approximately 6' on a route that had
taken him a mile or more.              This at page 113 H.


The     witness       was re-examined by Mr. Collins at page                114     who
re-examined        the    witness's     evidence about the       barrier           that
broke and referred to photograph 26 in the big bundle and also
photograph        45.     At    page 115 E and F the witness            says       that
there    were already people on the floor in front'of him before
the     barrier broke.         When the barrier broke this witness                 went
on    top of the people that had already fallen down in front of
him, standing on top of them with his legs between the bodies.

Examined by Mr. Philips at page 116.


David      Stephen           Moore comes from Wallasey in                        Merseyside.           He
arrived          at the area of the turnstiles at 2.30 p.m.                                  He had     a
ticket        for      the terrace, Leppings Lane entrance B,                                standing.
He had with him a stand ticket for a friend of his that he was
going      to       give          that friend.              There was going to          be     a     swap
between          the        friend they were giving the stand ticket to                               and
get     a terrace ticket from that friend for one of their                                         party
who needed a ticket.


This     witness's                evidence         regarding         the     crush     outside        the
turnstiles             is    much the same as heretofore but at page 117                                F
the     witness says he saw a Policeman on horseback driving                                          his
horse        sideways,             he thought trying to bring the                      people        that
were      going         down        by the river Don pushing them                      towards        the
turnstile           back into the main yard.                        The witness was           referred
to     photograph            4 of the slim bundle West Midlands 1. At                                page
1L8     Gthis witness says that he was fortunate to get into the
Ground        within about 10 minutes because of the actions of                                       the
Police        horse which helped him but he implies that the                                       Police
horse            actions discomforted                  others.       This witness,           at      page
119 B,             found the turnstiles to be narrow and hehad to                                    hold
himself          back because of pressure from behind.                               As soon as        he
let     go       he was through the turnstile.                          He gave us his             ticket
and received part of it back.


Once      inside            the     turnstiles this witness was                      able     to     wait
5 yards          behind           the      turnstiles on the Ground                  side     for     his
friends.            He could see Gate C, the large concertina gate.                                    At
page      119       E this witness says that he had been in the                                    Ground x
about        2 minutes and the concertina gate opened about 5' -                                       6'
but nobody came in and nobody went out.                                    The gate then closed.
                                            -   81 -




Within     a     space of the next few minutes the gate               was        opened
again     and     between          100 - 200 people came in.       This     at        page
119 F.      After           about 200 people came in the gate         was        closed
again     within seconds.            The people that came through walked at
first     but then speeded up to a run.                The only thing he             could
see     on the far side of the gate was a lot of foot Police.                          At
page     120     F the witness says that the first thing you see                        is
"Standing"           and then "P" on the only entrance that is               visible
which is the tunnel.


The witness then says that he saw the gate open a third time 2
or     3 minutes after it had opened for the second time at about
2.50 and 400 - 500 people came through it.                   Each time the gate
had     been     opened it was opened slightly more each                  time,        the
third     time it was opened between 12' - 15'.                When he saw             the
rash     of people coming through that gate he decided to go into
the     Ground.        He let the initial rush go by and then went into
the     Ground        through the tunnel, then to the right               hand        side
iato Pen 3.           He tried to get to the right hand side to get out
of     the way of the people coming through the tunnel but it was
not     possible and he was forced down at a slight angle to                           the '
front.         This at page 121 D.          He finished up about 8' from the
perimeter        fence.        The gate onto the pitch was 8 - 9           yards        to
his     left,        fairly close to the railing fence dividing                  Pen     3
from     Pen     2.         He was near the barrier that       collapsed.              The
witness        was shown photograph no. 26 in the larger bundle                        and
he     identified where he was standing.                The witness       recognised
himself        and     his     friends   on a photograph      in    bundle           South
Yorkshire        Photographs Composite Album 2 - photograph PR1/10A.
The     photograph           was   taken at 3.02 p.m.     At page     113        C     the
witness says that he was not conscious of the barrier braking,
his     friend        was     holding a girl that died up and         there          were
people     dead on the floor.            People were trying to shout to the
Police     on the railings at the side of the Pen that there were
dead     people in there.            At page 123 H the witness says that he
was pulling people out from a pile of people on the floor from
the     front        back up the terraces and there was space then                     for
                                   -   82 -




him     to do that.    2 Policemen had climbed in from No. 2 Pen to
help.      The witness carried a man through the front         perimeter
gate that was open onto the pitch.


The     witness was cross-examined by Mr. Jackson.      At page 125 A
the     witness says that in response to a lot of people shouting x
at    Policemen   to   the   effect "where were you?"    one     of   the
Officers in a flat hat said "We were only called'in 20 minutes
ago."     That exchange took place at about 4.40.

Maxwell          Ross is from The Wirral, a Senior Office of Customs &
Excise.          He is a Liverpool supporter and had a terrace ticket.
This witness describes his journey to Sheffield by car and his
difficulty in parking.                       He got near the Ground at about 2.50 -
2.55     p.m.           He asked a Police Officer for directions                                to     the
correct          end       and the Officer directed him by the                           main        Stand
towards the Leppings Road end.                              The witness ran up to that end
and     was told that there was chaos there so he ran back to the '
Kop     end.          He thinks he asks the same Officer the quickest way
from     that         point and was told that the Officer did                                 not    know
because          he     was        on     the Doncaster             force.          Another     Officer
directed          him via the roundabout.                         That last Officer said that
he      would         be      OK        because       they        had    delayed       the    kick-off
15 minutes            to let the crowd in.                       The Police Officer said that
positively.                This        was     from an Officer standing by                    the     Kop
turnstiles.                The witness eventually reached the Leppings Lane
end     between 3.05 and 3.10.                        At that time there were not                    many
people        around.            He went up the road which was virtually empty
to get into the Ground.                        The turnstiles were essentially empty
and     he       went       in an end turnstile although the gates                             to     the
right of the turnstiles appeared to be partially open.                                                His
ticket did not have a letter on it.


This     witness likes to see the game from a position as high as
possible          and       he        went to the steps to the right                    hand        side.
Shown     photograph                  14 in the big bundle of                  photographs,          West
Midlands bundle, the witness agreed that the scene depicted in
the     photograph               is     what     he        saw    as     he    came    through        the
turnstile.             At        that point there was a Steward at the                          bottom
who     said "You can't come in here, this is for seats only" and
pointed       the witness to the tunnel.                           The time was about               3.10.
There     were         a few other latecomers.                         The witness did not            see
any     Police         in that concourse at all and he only saw the                                   one
                                                -   84 -




Steward        who     had spoken to him.             At page 128 D      this    witness
told the Inquiry that down the tunnel a man he assumed to be a
Steward (because he had a yellow tunic) said "No hurry.                               There
are     fans        on the pitch and the players have gone                 off."           The
witness        thought          that this was a Liverpool Steward.              As        this
witness        got to the terrace with reasonable ease he saw people
climbing        over the fence both on to the pitch or                    endeavouring
to     climb onto the pitch and climbing to the left.                       He was not
aware     of any players on the field.                     The witness moved to            the
left side of what he now knows to be box 4 and assisted people
climbing        up into the Stand.              At about the same time that this
was going on he saw other people making their way back towards
the     tunnel.           There       were no officials in the area.             It        was
local     consternation that caused people to leave.                       He was          not
aware     of        any Police presence either in the tunnel or                      at     or
around        the    tunnel until much later.                He would    estimate          the
time to have been 3.30 before there was any Police activity at ^
the     back of the Stand.               This witness, at page 129 H, tried to
speak     to a Police Officer to tell him about the chaos on                               the
terrace        but received only a blank look and the Officer turned
away.


This     witness          was    cross-examined by Mr. Woodward.                At    page
131 D     the       witness confirms that in his written Statement                          he
says     "I had earlier heard a tannoy message for Liverpool fans
to     move     away from the entrances because there had been                            some
crushing.”           He     heard it over the tannoy when he was                 running
along the road outside the Ground before he reached                             Leppings
Lane gates.


Mr.     Woodward           effectively         took   this    witness     through         his
evidence        again.          Photograph PR2/17 in Composite Album 2                    was
shown     to the witness timed at 15.06 and the witness said that
was something of what he observed.


The    witness        Ross       was cross-examined by          Mr.     Glasgow.          The
witness       confirmed          he    heard    a tannoy message        when    he        was ^
                                             -   85 -




outside        the Ground.           Once he was on the terrace what he heard
were     just screams and shouts for assistance from the                     Police.
The witness thought he heard the tannoy message at about 3.05.


(Page        133)     Mr.     Glasgow suggested to this witness            that    the
tannoy       message        simply referred to crushing and            people     were   n
being        asked     to     move away because there was          crushing.       The
witness        considered        this to be a normal announcement made              at
Football           Grounds,     and thought it related to          latecomers      and
the     entrance        needed to be cleared.           This witness took it        to
mean     that people should move further in.                   He did not think it
meant        for     people     to    leave the     terrace.      He   thought     the
announcement           referred to crushing in the entrances, but                 when
he     got     into the Ground itself it became obvious to him                    that
the     crushing        was     at the front. This witness         would    not     be
moved        from his statement that he thought the normal                 football
announcement          which is common at most Grounds 5 minutes before
kick-off time, or around that time "would people                        move      away
from the entrance".

Examined by Mr Goldsack.


Anthony        Christopher            Smith is from Liverpool and came                 to    the
match       by coach.         Arrived in Sheffield about 1.00 pm and parked
10     minutes away from the ground. Policemen came to the door of
the coach and asked if we had tickets.                                 On the way to Sheffield
the     Police stopped the coach, got on the coach and checked                                if
everybody had a ticket and whether there was any alcohol on the
coach.       We reached the Leppings Lane entrance at about 2.30 pm.
There      was      a substantial build up of people at that time,                           the
witness says that his impression was that the mounted Policemen
were      unable       to     control their horses at that stage,                    and     the
horses were bulting and jumping about, and everyone swayed back
to     one way and then back the other way again.                             When the gate C
was opened people flowed through it like running water.                                   He had
not been to the ground before.                         He went through the tunnel.            It
was     the first thing he saw.                    He got pushed about half way down
the terrace and tried to shuffle across to the right because it
was totally compact.                   He was in pen 3.                He was carried down by
a surge.


As     soon as he got through the tunnel there was a surge and                                he
got    pushed to the centre behind the goal.                              He tried to shuffle
across       to     the     right but then another surge came and                     he     was
trapped       for      some minutes and eventually passed out.                       He     came
round to find someone was putting him over the perimeter fence.




The    witness        was cross examined by Mr Jackson to whom he                           said
that     once the gate was opened he was going on to the terracing
behind        the        goal whether he liked it or not.     He did not      know
that        there were so many people on the terracing when he was at
a point when he could see how many people were behind the goal
there was no turning back.


The        witness        was crossed examined by Mr Woodward who took         him
through           his evidence prior to reaching the ground when he            was
first        in     Sheffield at which time the witness said         everything
seemed        normal.        At page 137B and C the witness says that         fans
for        both sides were mingling in the streets, and running               very
quickly           along, the Public Houses were very very busy, the only
Police        he     was     conscious   of having   seen   were   two   mounted
Policemen.               It seemed alright when he was first in the ground,
and        he was walking up across the courtyard, and it was             little
different           in the tunnel than that when he was going across the
courtyard.               There were just people in front and behind, but if
he had wanted to stop and go back it would have been a struggle
to     get        back     out.   He said he could have stopped    if    he   had
wanted        to.        The witness wanted to be a bit to the right of the
goal        and     he     in fact reached a position to the right       of   the
goal.        He got pushed straight into the middle at first, and did
not        come up against a crush bar.        He described the activity in
the        pen as jostling rather than pushing.         He was not picked up
in     a     great tide or current, but was jostled and moved            a    bit
forward, a bit to the right, a bit forward, a bit to the right,
a bit along that sort of thing.              He did not know that a barrier
had collapsed.

Thursday 18th Mav 1989 afternoon session


Examined by Mr Philips.


Steven           Allen          lives in Merseyside.    Had been at     the        previous
years        match.             He made sure he got in quite early.           As he        had
done the previous year.                     He reached the turnstiles this year at
2.00        pm.       There were a few people walking around at that                      time
but     he was in a queue of only 5 or 6 so he was inside within a
second           or two.         His experience had been the same the              previous
year        at     2.00         pm.     He observed that there was     not        the     same
filtering             this       year as the previous year.        In 1988 he got              to
the roundabout at Penistone Road, there was a barrier across at
Leppings           Lane and he was asked to produce a ticket.                     This    did
not     occur          this year.          This witness expanded on    his         evidence
about what happened the previous year.


The witness noticed ticket touts very close to the                           turnstiles
selling tickets.


Once        insidethe ground he brought a programme,                  lookedat           his
ticket        and          it    was Section B of Leppings Lane, so          he     looked
around and saw that Section B was through the tunnel so he made
his     way through the tunnel into the terrace.                    Counsel drew his
attention             to    Section B referring to the turnstiles,                and     the
witness          responded that he was in the same section as last year
so     he     knew where to go.               He went through the tunnel.          At     the
end     of thetunnel he went to the                  left, the same as last             year.
He     was       in        pen     4.    On page 141 the witness    gives     a     rather
muddled description of a narrow area which the witness called a
double        fence, gate 5 with people apparently intending to stand
■within      that          area.        At about 2.20 pm, this witness was          pushed
down     close         to the fence by which time he had been                joined        by
other        fans including a girl called                    He was pushed down to
a    point near a barrier two thirds of the way down, there being
 tw o p e o p le     in   f r o n t o f h im b e f o r e t h e b a r r i e r .


When         the players came onto the pitch he realised that his feet
were         off the ground, and he was actually being supported by the
people            around him.        Until that time the pen had been full                             but
not over crowded.                 The crushed increased with a large influx of
fans         in     a very short space of time, as opposed to                              an    actual
surge and he ended up crushed against the fence.                                        The girl was
in a great deal of stress.


By turning his head through 90 degrees this witness was able to
look         at     the     North stand and could see the                        corner    pen        half
empty.            The g i r l h a d        said to him that she had to get out bf
here, and then they got seperated.                           This witness got out of the
pen      by climbing over the side fence into the space between the
double            fences.     The witness helped other people get over                                that
fence.             The space between the two fences is only about 5 or                                   6
feet.         He with other walked down to the gate at the bottom                                       of
the      partition          and     onto      the pitch.            That         gate    was     opened
intermitently.               A    Policeman          put     his arm        on      this       witness'
shoulder            at the gate and said "you should not be getting                                   onto
the      pitch”, but the witness took no notice and walked straight
on      to    the pitch anyway.               He remembered the gate being                       closed
after that behind him, but later it was opened and closed a few
times.            The     witness       has a St Johns            First       Aid       Certificate.
Until        that time he had been unaware there was very much                                       wrong
and      just thought that people had fainted, and put people                                         into
the     recovery position following a faint.                            He was unaware                that
anything           worse had happened at that time.                       When he got out               of
the space between the two fences and looked back to the terrace
the wire mesh was burried with people against it.                                       This witness
■went    to        presumably        the perimeter fence                and       assisted           other
supporters           and     Policemen lifting people over the top                              of    the
fence.


Eventually           Police       and     supporters pushed the fence                      back       and
forth        in     unison       to try and rip it off or roll                      it     up.        The
witness     asked     the   Policemen if there were      wire        cutters    or
hammers,     but he said there were none.      They managed to rip out
and role up and tie with rop or scarfs         some of the fence. Then
people climbed out and casualties were passed out.


The witness recalls an ambulance crossing the pitch and parking
up    on   the   track behind the goal at which       time      some     oxygen
became     available.       The witness recalled an announcement           over
the tannoy       by   Kenny Dalgleish, when    he spoke         it    went very
quite.


The   witness    Allen      was cross examined by   Mr    Woodward.            The
witness was taken through his evidence comparing his experience
approaching      the ground this year, as opposed to 1988.              This at

 Volume 2 of DAC bundle of transcripts page 149
 Thursday 18th Mav 1989 afternoon session


 Examined by Mr Goldsack.


 Mr     Mahew        is a serving Officer in the Merseyside Fire              Brigade
 and arrived at Leppings Lane at approximately 2.35 pm.                       When he
 arrived        he said there was total confusion and he did not                   know
 where     his        access to the ground was.         Eventually he found          his
 way     over        to the right hand side, at which time the             big     blue
 gates     were        closed.        While he was moving around      with       others
 outside the big blue gates for a matter of minutes a few people
went      through,           when    they were closed again.      Within     about       5
minutes         they were opened again and he was carried through with
the      rest        of the people because the Police just could not                 get
those      gates closed again.             At page 149 G this witness said            he
got      into        the     ground through those blue gates which         lead       us
through         to     the    turnstile     area, and   as   we   approached       the
turnstile            area there was a few queuing up there to got through
the     turnstiles,           but you did not have to queue        there     because
around the corner there was a concertina gate which was open.


He     waited for three friends and went down the tunnel.                    He    had
been     to the ground the previous year.               This witness says         that
he went onto the terrace on the West stand where the Nottingham
Forest stand was this year.                 He went there last year but he was
directed        there last year.           He was standing last year.        At page
150     the     witness gives some evidence about what              happened       the
previous year as opposed to what happened this year so far                           as
he was concerned.


This     year he went through the tunnel and at the end there were
some     steps up and that was the first sight he had of the crowd
right     at the back.              Within seconds he was pushed down into the
crowd.        He was in pen 3 directly behind the goal.               As he       came
from     the tunnel it was to the right hand side.                 He was able to
 see     the     perimeter gate and saw a Police Officer in charge             of
 that     gate.     This witness said that the Police Officer on            that
 gate appeared to be frightened of what was going on in front of
 him.      Thewitness said that he was aware that that gate was the
 onlymeans of            exit from that area, and as soon as he got         into
 the     crowd he knew that he had to get out because it was not                  a
 normal        crush.    At the previous year there had been a bit of             a
 crush but nothing like that he experienced on this occasion,and
 he     eyes    were on that gate because that was the only way             out,
 and    that     gate was closed.      He saw the gate opened a couple        of
times          to let     one or two people out and then     it was       closed
again.   On the third occasion when the gate                opened    he     got
through that gate.


Once     through        the gate another Police Officer asked him to          go
into     one     of the other pens further along.        At this point       the
witness        saw bodies being laid behind the goal and the          witness
went down to the locked gate at which a Policemen was in charge
of     section 1A the next one along.         The witness told the Police
Officer that he was a Fireman trained in First Aid, and offered
to     help on the pitch.         The Police Officer told him that         there
were too         many people on the pitch and his assistance was             not
needed.


This     witness        was   unable to give any evidence   as   to       Police
radios.         The witness said the tannoy system appeared to him to
be     completely in audable.        He could not hear anything from it.
The     witness     said that something was being transmitted but             he
could     not     understand what ever it was.     The    witness     thought
it was         the voice of the tannoy system rather than        additional
noise.


The     witness Mahew was cross examined by Mr Woodward.             He    took
him through his evidence again concerning his entrance into the
ground.   He said that during his journey through the tunnel he
could have stopped if he had wanted to.
The witness was shown photograph 24 in the fifth bundle, 23 and
24     and said that it did not look like the pen that he was                in.
The    witness    was    shown photograph 21.     At page 154        there    is
confusion      between   the   witness   and Mr    Woodward     as     to    the
photographs      and precisely where this witness was.          The witness
was shown photograph 1-11A. The witness said that he was                     not
aware at any stage of the collapse of a barrier.

At  page 155 Mr Collins addressed the judge to the effect that
there were three witnesses              and          who might
not add anything specific to that which had already been heard,
but they were present if there evidence was required.                The time
was    apparently   approaching 5.00 pm on the Thursday          afternoon
18th    May    1989 and the Judge said that he would not hold               back
any witness who thought he had something to say just because of
the    time.   A witness identified himself to the Judge as having
something to say, and that witness was Michael Gerrard Hill.

Examined by Mr Collins.


This      witness       told   the   inquiry   that   in   his   opinion       the
concertina       gate     should never have been opened at all, and             he
knows     that    it was opened at least three times.            The    witness
gave     the opinion that the game should have been delayed or                  an
announcement      made and then sufficient time left for people                 to
get in.


At     page 158 there was a discussion as to the adjournment.                  The
inquiry    was    adjourned until 10.00 am the         following       morning.
Further    witness       would   be called and it was arranged          that     a
film    would    be     shown in the Mandela room to       which   any     body
concerned with the inquiry, any member of the public and                       the
press could attend.

 Witness Neil Fit^maurice


 Examined by Mr Goldsack, page 1.


Neil     Fitzmaurice       is     a resident at
 Liverpool,     arrived         at Sheffield by Minibus and got parked           at
about 2.40 pm. Prior to parking the van they had been to a pub
for a drink and had about 2 pints of larger.


Arriving      at Leppings Lane he saw a massive crowd as               described
by     so many others.       This witnesses evidence follows along              the
same lines as that which has gone hereto before.                  He entered by
the     concertina     door.          This    witness considers that     it     was
absolutely      essential           for    the concertina gates to be        opened
because of the people being crushed up against the iron gates.


This witnesses experiences inside the ground was very                    similar
to that which has gone hereto before.


At     page   3 this witness says that going towards the               actual    B
entrance      midway through the tunnel when the force hit him from
behind.       This    at     page    3A.     The witness was in    pen 4.       He
finished up alongside the railing seperating B section from                      A
section to the left of pen 4.


This    witness      gives      graphic descriptions at page       5    of    what
occurred      within the pen until he succeeded in getting over the
railings into the no-mans land straight between the two fences,
and    then climbed onto the pitch.             At page 7 this witness        says
"that once the Fire Brigade arrived the recovery situation                     got
tinder way.


The witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward and was shown the
 bundle       of     photographs and looked at photograph PRl 7A.                  From
 the      transcript        on     page7 at about F/      it   appears     that     Mr
 Woodward stopped questioning the witness Fitzmaurice concerning
 the     photographs, I would anticipate because the witness became
 upset,       and     Mr Woodward took the witness through his              evidence
 again     about his arrival in Sheffield, at page 10 this                     witness
 states       that he did not hear any Police tannoy or a hailer from
 a     Police      vehicle telling people to come back, to stand                  back,
 and     says that he was surrounded by people shouting so he could
 not      hear      anything.        At page 13B this witness says         that the
 first people through the concertina gate stumbled over and fell
 down, and the people following went over the top of them.                         Fans
 trampled        on them.        At page 13E, this witness says that he just
 ran     into      where he was going and did not try to assist any                  of
 them.        At page 14C the evidence concerning the concertina gate
 and     people      falling was withdrawn and it appears at               page     14D
 that     the witness intended to describe people who fell as                     they
went      in through the outside gate from Leppings Lane.                  At     page
 14     and 15 this witnesses evidence becomes very muddled and                     at
page      16C      it appears that      the people to whom the         witness had
been referring as having fallen down were in fact people who
had been closed out. This at page 16C.


At     page         17C it is established that        when     the   witness       was
referring           to the opening of the gates being necessary he                 was
not     in fact referring to the concertina gates but to the                      very
outside       gates,     the outside perimeter gate.            Nobody fell       when
•the    concertina       gates were opened.         Mr Woodward      pursues      this
witnesses        evidence at pages 17, 18 and 19, at about page 20 it
is appreciated that possibly part of the witnesses statement in
the      possession       of      Counsel    is   missing,     and   the   evidence
continues           to be muddled.          At page 29F   the' witness      having
previously         described himself has having been restrained by two
or     three Police Officers says that he was trying to get people
to     pull the fence down with him and it may well be that he was
retrained           by the Police who thought that he had perhaps                 lost
his cool.
At page 30B through to G, Lord Justice Taylor took this witness
affectively    through   the   witnesses   evidence so   far   as    his
experience    was concerned and the situation is clarified.         This
witness does not in fact add very much to that which has            gone
hereto before.

This witness was in fact not called because the inquiry did not
have before it a complete copy of his statement and so the
witness was stood down for the moment to be called at < later
time.

 Anglea Hockenhall             had     a   statement taken from            her        by    West
 Midlands Police.

                                                       and on the day                 of        the

 am on the day of people entering and urinating in her garden.


 At page 35C the witness states that most of them appeared to be
 quite drunk.           They appeared to have been drinking anyway.


 She    at      first tapped on the window to signal them out                         of        the
 garden,        but     as   time    progressed and the         numbers          of    people
 entering        her garden         for this purpose increased up to                  several
douzen       over      the    span    of   time from   1.00       pm       to     2.30          pm.
Eventually          this     witnesses husband found and complained                        to     a
Police       Inspector        who placed a Police Officer in front of                           her
garden which successful stopped the practice.                        She said that in
front      of    her property at any one time 20 or 30 people sat                                in
the area nearby.             Some holding perhaps one can of beer in their
hands,  some holding                a four pack with one or          two        out.         Her
property is f


This    witness         occasionally       has   a little       trouble         with       this
practice in her garden before ordinary matches, but there were
alot more people in                    than on usual League
fixtures.


Cross examined by Mr Jackson she said that - the

d e s c r i b e s a c u r a t e l y w h e r e the toilets are on page        37C.   She
stated that this ground is designated as the appropriate ground
for some 55 thousand travelling fans without a car park.                                  It is
anticipated           that a great number of people pass up and down the
 streets        nearby       her    house.     The witness herself has       to       make
 arrangements for collecting litter after a match out of her own
 garden.         The facilities provided for a match are dustbins                       all
 the way along                                 The little yellow ones tend to be
 mounted        on telegraph poles.            The witness states that       normally
 the Council are very good at cleaning the road after the match.


 At     page     38B Mr Jackson challenged this witness on                 the     basis
 that     one     or two very noticably drunk as opposed to                 "most       of
 them     seem to be quite drunk".               The witness stuck to her          point
 to the fact that most of them did appear to be quite drunk.                            In
 response       to     the Judge she described "quite drunk" as                  varying
 degrees       of drunkenness.             She explained her reason for thinking
 that     they        were in various states of drunkenness on the                basis
that      they        spoke    with slured voices, one or two of them                  did
actually have difficulty in standing up and that gave her                              the
impression that they were quite drunk.


Mr     Jackson        challenged the witness about her            verbal    evidence
against        her statement from which he read from the second                       page
"one     or     two    were        quite    noticably   drunk".     The    witnesses
response        to this was "that was at an earlier stage.                 That        was
before     the       bulk of them came down at 2.30 pm."            This at           page
38F.


At     the instigation of the Judge Mr Jackson put to her from her
statement        "from       about 2.30 pm there was a noticable surge                  of
fans     towards       the    ground.        In the main mostly    drunk,        in    my
opinion".        The witness answered thats right.            This at page 39B.


Further        challenged      by     Mr Jackson on the basis that          she       was
describing only the people urinating in her garden, at page 39E
in     response to a question she said "the ones who actually came
into    the     garden were nearly all drunk, the ones on                  the     road
quite a large percentage of them I would say had been drinking,
I am not saying they had all been drinking."
 This witness said that she thought there were                              probably            less
 cans at the previous year.


 At     page     40D       this        witness     diferenciated      between         Sheffield
 supporters and Liverpool supporters only by the                                  fact          that
 Liverpool supporters tended to be going up
 towards the ground and she assumed the other supporters                                     would
 have been going along Penistone Road.


 Cross     examined             by     Mr Woodward he as usual took             the        witness
 through        the evidence again when she said that it was not                                just
 her     garden        selected          for this behaviour, but a lot                of     local
 residents           had    a        similar problem.       At page 4IE     this       witness
 states        that a lot of the cans left in her garden were tennants
 super strength and that type of high gravity larger and beer.


At page 42B this witness states that prior to her husband going
to     get Police assistance she had become upset because                              towards
2.30     and     3.00        pm some of the individuals in her                   garden         had
actually        waived          their       genitles      at her.   At    page     42F       this
witness        stated        that in her opinion the people that came                        from
about     2.30        to 3.00 pm did appear to be more intoxicated                           than
those previous.              At page 43B Counsel obtained from this witness
that it was her impression that as the morning got close to the
time     of     the        kick       off    and   that    compared      with    her        usual
experience           there       were       a lot more people somewhat           much        more
drunk     than before, significantly less cooperative and arrogant
and     selfish        in their behaviour going past her house, and                             she
said the road is usually clear by about 2.50 pm, but the                                     road
■was still very full coming up to 3.00 pm.


Cross examined by Mr Glasgow at page 43 he established that the
witness        has     a crowd going past her house approximately                           every
other weekend throughout the football season.                            The witness said
that     the     crowd          going past was not always unpleasant.                      On    a
usual     home weekend it is not usual for a continuous stream                                  of
supporters       to        be going past.          Certainly not as many as                this.
The    witness   summed up, with the help of Mr Glasgow, that   not
only     was the quantity of people significantly greater than the
normal    weekend, but the behaviour was noticably more offensive
and drunken. This at page 43F. This was so more than with any
other group of supporters that witness had seen.

 Examined by             Mr     Philips the witness Lee Oxley            said     that
                                                                                    he
 lived in
                                                  area   Sheffield    and had lived in
 that        district         for    26        years. He has lived     in his present
 address           for   the past 6 years. He is quite used              to      Sheffield
 Wednesday           football ground crowds.             He was athome on        the     15th
 April,        the day of the match with his wife who is a nurse.                        The
 witness       went out of his house into the area about 12.00 to the
 house       of some friends and to get there he wan* ,innn
             He went
                                          When he first went along
 there       was no problem at all.                 There were some porters mingling
 in    groups but they had no problems getting along
 at    all.        Having made their visit he left at about 12.20 -12.40
 pm    and     walked to the shops on the Middlewood Road to                      get     to
Hillsborough             archade the shopping area.              He was with his wife.
At     the Hillsborough shopping centre he saw fans mingling                           with
normal everyday shoppers, there was nothing out of the ordinary
it happens every semi final. After shopping he got back to
                         about 2.30 pm. At that time there was
a huge crush.     He had never seen so many people                          at    a    semi
final at that time 2.30 pm.


The     crush along |                              was very much worse than on           any
previous years he had witnessed it.                         The previous year at about
1.00      to 1.30 pm it had been quite conjested with people making
there        way    to    the ground, but this time there did not seem                   to
be     any     great      hurry to get to the ground, it                was justpacked.
He    was able to go down                                   w ith difficulty, they had
to keep breathing in and out of people and were getting jostled
by people.          He was keeping to the side across from the football
ground.        The road was opened to traffic.                   The fans were on the
pavements          but        were    spilling onto the roads           as welland        the
coaches       were        lining          up    all along                        chopping
   supporters                         off.              This       at   page 46.        This   witness        made      the
  assumption                          that             the     coaches     were    dropping          off     supporters
  although                      he did not actually see supporters getting out of the
  coaches.                       When this witness rsfprro^

                                                                                                           This witness
              tnat oasis was walking down from the top,


--------------------------------------------------1                                i.          J

  "have               you            got              any    spares mate".        The      people      walking        down
 towards                    the            ground            were, this witness said in                general        high
 spirits,                      there                  were    one or two who looked a bit                  groggy      and
 there                was a strong smell of drink in the air.                                        He said       people
 carrying cans of beer.                                        Some were carrying soft drinks but they
 were carrying beer.


 It         took              this witness about 15 minutes to get from
                                      ° where he was going, a walk which  he
would                normally cover in 2 or 3 minutes. He got home at about
 2.45 pm.                     At that time the crowd showed no sign of thining out.
This              at         page 48B.                      At about 3.15 pm this witnesses father                      in
law            called                 at               the witnesses house         while       the    witness          was
watching                     television                      and was not aware of any trouble                    at    the
ground.                      His            father            in    law said that there            had      been      some
trouble at the ground and there were people feared dead, and so
with his wife he ran out of the house
                                         ]bo assist. He saw all the
p e o p l e w alking away from the ground, thousands of people just
coming out in droves.                                        The time was then about 3.15 to 3.20 pm.
This            witness                    went with his wife because a neighbour had                                 said
that            there had been appeals for help.                                        Nurses,etc.        All     along
the          roads they had sectioned the roads off, that is the Police
sectioned                      off           the top of the roads.                 There were two or               three
Policemen                      on          every road.              The witness did not              see    emergency
services                    arrive                    straight away.       His wife did not go into                   the
ground at all.                               Just by the concertina gate C his wife assisted
people               who            had been injured and affected by the                              crush.          The
witness also assisted.                                        At page 49B the witness stated that the
  assistance that was being given to those who had been effected
  seemed to be organised.


 The     witness       saw ambulances probably within 5 minutes                       of     him
 actually        getting      to    the   perimeter        gates,     ambulances           were
 arriving        all the time ferrying the injured off.                     One in,        load
 the people on and then away. The whole time this witness                                   was
 there assisting people were leaving the ground.


 Cross examined by Mr Jackson this witness was shown album 1 and
 restated the timings of his movements.                    He looked at photograph
 10/20A       on page 50 the witness was challenged by Mr Jackson                            as
 to whether fans were right across the road or not.                             The witness
 said     they    were       not right across the road,               but       lining both
 sides     of the road and spilling onto the road.                    At page 50F the
 witness said that the road was more conjested than the pictures
 20A, 2 1A and 22A reflected.                 The crowd had definately increased
 after    that       time.      The     witness did     not    notice           any     Police
 Officers      there.        At page 5IB Counsel succeeded in establishing
 from    the     witness that the photographs shown to him                        showed         a
 less crowded situation than he saw 15 minutes later.


This witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward at page 51.                                 The
witness       said that it appeared to him that a lot of people                            had
come     to    this match a lot later than usual.                   Between 2.30           and
2.45     pm    the    situation was unlike           his    previous        experience.
There     were people amonst the crowd carrying cans of drink                              and
people     drinking.          At page 5IF and G the witness says that                       in
response       to requests for tickets he did not answer, he did not
want     to open his mouth and thereby identify himself as                            having
come     from Sheffield, they were Liverpool supporters and he was
apprehensive         of   them, his wife got rathered                 frightened. At
page     53C in response to the Judge the witness said yes he                              was
swimiraning    against        the     tide.     The witness said          the     air      was
strong throughout his                 journey more than he          had     noticed         at
previous semi finals.

 Friday 19th-May 1989 morning ssssinn


 Examined by Mr Goldsack


 Mrs Constance Sweet is a resident of Sheffield and has a friend
 who     lives       close        to the Hillsborough ground where    she     often
 spends time at weekends and is used to the situation of a match
 being       at Hillsborough on a Saturday.             On those occasions        this
 witness       and        her friend Mr Bartholomew sometimes went          out     to
 watch       the     horses.       This witness and Mr Bartholomew     went        out
 into Leppings Lane at about 2.45 pm.                  They joined Leppings Lane
 at                            This witness noted that the crowd wa
 a        larger this year comparing the same time at Leppings Land
 with     the previous year. This witness says at page 55E that a
 lot of the crowd were alright, some had been drinking.                    She saw
 several      carrying cans and four packs, drinking as they                walked
 and    throwing          them     on the floor when they had    finished     with
them.        There was rubbish left all over the road and             pavement.


This     witness          said that the rubbish was alot worse       this     year
than     previous          years.     There were several people running       past
saying       tickets, tickets.             They were mainly young people.     This
witness       was        shown photograps.       At page 57C this witness     says
that she could only see the head of a Police horse. Outside
the gates in the street. The witness looked at photograph
number 4 and said that from the position from some waste ground
they entered that would have been the view that would have been
covered.           The     time that they reached the waste       ground     would
have been about 2.55 pm.                  At that time it was absolutely packed
outside      the         gates.     At page 58F this witness said    that         she
could     hear a Policeman with a loud speaker and she was looking
down     on him, he got on top of a car and was begging the                 crowd
to stop pushing.             The vehicle was a Land Rover.      The Land Rover
was     somewhere         in front of the perimeter gates.       On the     light
part    of    the model.           He was appealing for the crowds    to     stop
  pushing       and       he kept repeating this message all the time.                   He
 was      using       a    hailer.      The witness could hear it on           the    bank
  side.        She     had not heard any announcement before she                reached
 the piece of waste ground. The crowd had been very noisey and
 were still noisey but she could hear the Policeman. He kept
 repeating           "this       is a Police message.    Would you     please         stop
 pushing        at    the        turnstiles as people are    getting       squashed".
 Nothing        happended as a result of his repeated request.                   Nobody
 moved away as a result of the announcement.                     The   crowd          just
 stayed as it was.


 There was still people arriving but not as packed coming                             down
 as previously.


 Thiswitness          saw youths         urinating on a piece of waste           ground
 where          she       was.At page 6IB this witness says she saw              people
 trying to push there way further into the crowd.                    The people at
 the     back were pushing people to one side to get to the                      front.
 They were pushing and shoving to get into the ground, and there
 appeared       to be some panick because it would be nearly time for
the      whistle to go for the match to start.              This at page 6IE at
page 61G, this witness said that she could see odd Policemen in
the     crowd        but the crowd was so dense that you could only                   see
the     Policemen's          helmets.      They were foot Officers.        I    should
think        three or four officers in the crowd.            At page 62 B and. C
the witness referrs to a (concertina) gate being at the side of
the     river and the crowd sort of turned from the turnstiles                         to
go     into this gate the same mass.              The witness did not actually
see     it    open.        Most of the crowd turned that way         and       started
pushing       that        way.      A   large mass of   people   fairly        quickly
disappeared          into that gate.        She did not know where they              went
after         that.       This witness then left to go to the shops at page
53D,     this witness            saw the first fire engine arrive.      It pulled
up     at the gates.             The witness then saw ambulances and           further
fire engines arrive.               The witness then saw obviously distressed
people       begining to come out of the ground.            There is not         much
Police       activity        outside the ground at that      time.      Policemen
     stood around in Leppings Lane.                The witness thought they         were
     there to control the crowds.


     This witness was cross examined by Mr Jackson who described her
     as     the first "sightseer" the inquiry had seen.               She was      shown
 p otograph             album 1.      she was taken through her movements           with
 the        help of the photographs.             Counsel made the point that some
 of        the    photographs        do not reveal very many        people    carrying
 a cohol.              at    page   66B Mr Jackson got from the       witness      that
 although          she       was not an expert it was obvious to her at            2 45
 when she returned to Leppings Lane that the people outside the
 ground could not get inside the ground for 3.00 pm.


 At page 66D the witness said at the time she noticed the crowds
 at 2.55 pm, they would not have got in for 3.00 pm.


 On        page 66 the witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward.                    He
 took        the witness through her evidence about wanting to see the
 Police          horses and got from her that at the time that she                 went
 on        a normal match day the supporters would all have gone in by
then.   He took her through her movements again. This witness
as have other witnesses previously observed Police at the ends
of the roads leading up to the ground.


This witness found the supporters to be rather disorderly, they
were swearing, they were using offensive language and urinating
xn the streets.                He said there were men urinating against            the
bridge wall.


The        witness was shown photograph West Midslands 1,                  photograph



at        page    69    the inquiry tried to consider the time             that    the
Police        Land Rover arrived.          I   do not think it was established.
At        page 71B Counsel got from this witness her impression                   that
the        Policemen         were   overwelmed    and the   crowd    was     in   fact
uncontrolled,               but really it would be fair to say that at            this
 tune the crowd was uncontrolable.                   The witness immediately said
 thereafter            however,         "you could not have got that          crowd     into
 that       ground through those turnstiles, no way".                   At page 72           Mr
 Woodward took this witness through her observations when                                she
 saw the crowd coming out of the ground at about 3.30 pm.


 At        page        72E     Counsel     again   got   from    thewitness            that
 notwithstanding               the   loud speaker appeal, people were                forcing
 their way into an obviously conjested mass of people, not just
 joining it but forcing their way in.


 The witness was cross examined by Mr Glasgow commencing at page
      .    At        page 72G this witness said she heard an                 announcement
 from the ground from the loud speaker system after the accident
 had      happened         when the witness was stood on the            bridge.         She
 heard      a        request for people to move off the perimeter so                   they
could see to the injured.                    That message was coming           from     the
inside of the ground.


Page       73B,       page 8 of this witnesses statement was put                 to     her
"will       the people on the perimeter track move onto the                      playing
area       so we can treat the injured", but questioned the                      witness
could       not       recall the playing area actually             being      mentioned.
  e   recalled however the announcement and      move off the
perimeter track so that we can treat the injured. By then it
had       gone       quiet inside the ground.        At page 73E-G Counsel             got
from      the        witness     that     although she in    the      past     had    seen
numerous         football        crowds,     the language/      the   drinking,        the
urinating            and     the unpleasantness that she witnessed              was    not
typical         of     the     football crowd behaviour that          she     had     seen
previously.             This    particular crowd's behaviour           was     uniquely
unpleasant and she had never seen behaviour as unpleasant                               as
that from a football crowd before.

     Janet        Anne Ellis is a
     the     Hillsborough           staiium.        She was examined by        Mr    Goldsack.
     She     has     witnessed football fans and crowds oyer a                      period        of
      ime and said that by about midday on the 15th April there were
     quite        a lot of fans arriying, but it was quite a normal                        match
 day,         everybody was in really good spirits,                     she did not see           a
     o      of drinking at that time,                   she did see drinking yery early
 when        she arriyed at 7.30 when there were fans summersalting on
 Leppings           Lane.        After that things seemed to return to                    normal
 until           about 1.15 pm.          At that time young people were                arriying
 in         Ots of bunches, they were coming into her shop                          passageway
 and         weeing openly".             They were carrying packs of larger.                 She
 is        used to a few using the outside of her premises to urinate,
            when it got to 2.00 pm when she wanted to leaye and it was
 so   bad at 2.30 when there were as many as 50 men in the                                 yard
 urinating.                                                                                7


 It seemed to her that a larger number of people had drink with
 t em, they seemed to be drinking more than usual.


This        witness         intended to go to a general store to shop                     which
has an off licence facility. The shop is in Southey Green
Road. As she went into the shop a crowd of fans jumped off a
bus        and     followed       her into the shop, perhaps a             douzen         fans.
They        were grabing hold of bottles and cans and were just                            into
everything.            The staff of the shop could not cope, some of them
were        putting       bottles        and cans into their pockets             and      under
     eir     coats      and     so one of the staff said            "we    are      throwing
everyone           out”.      That group of fans were drunk,               she      did    not
 now       which side they were supporting, but they were                        Liverpool
by       their      accent, but could not swear to it.                  The incident         in
the        shop     occurred at about 2.45 or 2.50 pm.                  when   they       were
refused           service     the     group of fans in the shop ran              out,      but
 threw        bails of hay which were for sale outside the shop,              into
 the     shop.        The shop where the incident occurred is         some     way
  rom the ground and it appeared to the witness that there was
 only a trickle of fans still on the way to the match at that
 point.


 when        this   witness returned to work on the Monday morning            she
 saw the effects of alot of drinking in that there was                     little
 still all over the road.


 The     witness Ellis was cross examined by Mr Woodward.              He asked
 her     about the presence of the Police.           At page 4D this witness
 said     I    have       never seen as many Police at a    football       match.
 There       was no shortage of Police.       She said I could not believe
the      amount      of    Police that were there,    she   said    noone     was
a lowed        to hang around, and the Police were there very              early
Some     fans       did    not   want to be moved along.    At     12.00     this
witness thought the atmosphere was very good, it was                   as     she
said "partyfied".


This     witness repeated that there was a lot more drink, she saw
by     the     supermarket on Halifax Road and Halfords          hundreds     of
people        lying around drinking.      This is not an exageration         and
not what she had seen before.            At page 6 this witness describes
hordes of fans            urinating along the main road intent on getting
drink     from somewhere, climbing over walls using foul language,
 eing     obusive.          The crowd lying around drinking were some         10
minutes away from the ground at 2.50 pm.              She did not see where
they went after that.

 Examined by Mr Philips.


 This       witness had been stood down at the inquiry previously and
 was     now      called.       Frederick James Eccleston is a senior                            nurse
 manager,         and    lives in the Wirrel near Liverpool.                          He went       to
 the     match      with his son and another young man, and                            approached
 Leppings         Lane     end at 2.25 pm.             He had parked some              two       miles
 away       from the ground.            He approached from the river end across
 the     bridge       and was able to get to the perimeter gates of                                the
 ground       quite      easily, but once he got to the                          perimeter       gates
 which      was^ opened, there was a tremendous crush.                                There      were
 people coming along the Leppings Lane end behind him across the
 bridge but there was no crush at that time.                                  it took 10 minutes
 or    more from the perimeter to the turnstiles, and that was the
 worst      experience he had every had at a game.                               There were three
 Police       Officers on horse back and the horse having nudged                                  the
witnesses          glasses, the Police Officer apologised for the                                fact
and     the       witness      and the Officer smiled                  at each       other.       The
Police        Officers       were in the crowd but there were                        no     orderly
forms        of    queues.         He     was     aiming         for      4    turnstiles.         He
identified turnsiles A-G on the plan. This witnesses evidence
is similar to that which has gone hereto before at page 9B, he
says     that the turnstile worked efficiently, immediately behind
the turnstiles inside the ground there was a Policeman and this
steward.            At page 9 this witness describes what occurred                                the
previous          year with a line of Police Officers and stewards that
stopped           them goingthrough             the tunnel.               Once     inside        this
witness           went straight to the toilet just to the left                              of   the
tunnel.        This      witness saw one of the gates being                          opened      and
people      coming through and because of this                         ran through the           gap
in    the     wall and round to the North side,                        up the       stairs.       He
went high up on the left hand side, high on the terracing.
    This        witness said that the previous year he had at first tried
    to     go     to     the opposite side of the ground, but         it     was     very
    crushed so he had gone the way round and went the same way this
    year.         it was reasonably confortable where he was, there                  were
    plenty        of     fans there, but was amazed to see under           the      score
    board       and     the right hand pen were half empty.          He    could      see
    pens 3 and 4 absolutely packed full at a quarter to three.


    At    page     11     this witness says that he could see          the       players
    coming       out     onto the field.    He saw the kick off and the             game
    starting,          he remembered the shot which hit the goal post,               and
    at that moment the Liverpool crowd behind the goal in pen 3 and
    4    surged        forward.   This at page H E .     it was then       that     this
    witness  saw People           being passed down across the heads.               This
    coincided with the            teams going off.       At   this   time        whereas
    normally       at the front of the pens there would be heads bopping
 all the time, on this occasion he noticed that there                         was        no
 movement and they were flat.


 At page 12A this witness recals seeing a Police Officer running
 onto       the pitch to stop the game and he saw fans trying to                     get
over        the        fence, some of them being pushed back, some of              them
getting over.             One fans was arrested and was pleading not to be
put       back,        you could tell he was pleading for        something.          He
could        see Police Officers on the perimeter track.               He saw       one
gate being opened and at that time decided to go down to try to
help.


This witness became aware that something was badly wrong as the
teams       came        off.   This at page 12D.   At page 12F this          witness
knew the way by his last years experience onto the pitch he got
a       steward        to take him, the steward did not hesitate            at     all
once       he     was told that the witness was a trained nurse he                  was
taken the quickest way under the stand and a Police Officer let
him      on the pitch.         That at page 12F.       At page 12G this witness
said       some Police were just standing around whilst others                     were
working like beavers at the gate.              At page 13E the witness said
 that      he       ordered        three Police Officers to help him          carry        an
 injured         fan way and they obeyed him.              At page 13F the witness'
 impression           was       that    nobody   had taken control     of     what        was
 happening           behind the goal although individual Police                   Officers
 used     their initative and some were great.                  There seemed to            be
 no overall control.                 At page 14 the witness gives an account of
 his     own        activities providing people on the field                and     slowly
 developing           improvement         as St Johns Ambulance people            and     the
 Fire     Brigade began to get a grip of the situation.                     At page 15
 he     describes the gynasium as having been split into two.                            Ope
 side for the dead and one side for the injured where there were
 three     doctors           but     no drugs or equipment.     This    witness          ran
 outside        to     senior Police Officers who were in a             nomans          land
 area outside and asked them to get equipment.                    They found three
 small     boxes of equipment for them within about 5 minutes.                            He
 says     the        St     Johns Ambulance room were not       allowed      to     carry
 drugs     of        any sort.He helped Doctors set up           ten   equipment.
 Police Officers held up the bottles or packs because there were
 no stands to hold up the fluids.


At     page      16       this witness describes having         been   checked           for
tickets         the       previous year as other witnesses         have      described
herein.


The     witness was cross examined by Mr Hytner commencing at page
17.      At     page 17F Mr Hytner established with the witness                         that
natural        impatience to get into the ground is one of the things
that     rightly           or wrongly is to be anticipated and the                witness
agreed     with           Hytner that the same will apply to an opera or                   a
Play^ just           as     well.      This at page 17F.   At   page    17G       Hytner
obtained        the witnesses agreement that in the             ground today            the
danger     might          not      be apparent because the crush in         the     area
between        the rails and the turnstiles would have a safety valve
down     the        perimeter       path along the river, but this          had     been
blocked off by barriers and there was a bottle neck crush.                              The
witness        at     18D    was not aware of two turnstiles           at    A-G        not
working.            The witness said they all seemed to be working,                     but
 it     was     just the difficulty of getting to them.                This at       18D.
 The^ Judge        observes         at 18F that from the       video    it      appeared
 noticable        that      it took quite a long time for somebody to                 get
 from     one turnstile as against the one next to it.                    At page 19C
 this     witness did not entirely accept Hytner's suggestion                        that
 it^ was Plain as a pikestaff to anybody looking who had seen
 this crush within the area would be able to tell that a
 dangerous situation was clearly developing, but the witness did
 to     some    extent       accept the proposition.        At page       20C      Hytner
 having developed his theme obtained from the witness that there
 had     been    no     messages      on   the tannoy and      he   had      not    been
 conscious       of     stewards      trying to direct fans into          safer       and
 better positions.           The witness did not hear any tannoy messages
 telling       people      at the Leppings Lane end to move to the                 other
 side.        At page 20G the witness says that the entrance of                     fans
 onto the pitch was not a pitch invasion,                        they     were      just
 attempting to get into a safer position.


The witness thought that the actual reason for                         people      going
onto the pitch had been misunderstood in fact.


At     page 20H this witness said that he was aware that something
was wrong within 2 minutes of the teams going off.                      At page 2 IB
the     witness       is    quite     sympathetic   to   the    difficulty          that
authority       might       have had initially in understanding what                 was
happening,        people coming over the barrier, but once some                     fans
got     over    it was clear that they were not invading the                    pitch,
they were actually pleading, and the Liverpool goalkeeper                            had
noticed it as well.


This     witness was cross examined by Mr Jackson at page 21                       when
he     confirmed      that     in    1988 there were     Police     Officers        and
stewards       preventing      people      going down the      tunnel     and      this
witnes     further         said that it was exactly 2.45 pm that he                made
his observation of 1989 that the central pens were too full.


The witness was cross examined by Mr Kallipetis on page 21 when
 he    established        that at no time from the time that he                  started
 watching        the pens behind the goal mouth to            the time that              he
 decided to leave his position to assist on the pitch did he see
 anybody,        conscious or unconscious being passed up the                    terrace
 through        the    tunnel.     The witness said that the few that                  were
 being moved at that time were going down towards the front.                             At
 that time it would not have been possible to                        move        up     the
 terrace against the crush of people.


 Questione       by the       Judge this witness said that          when     he         was
answering Mr Kallipetis he was speaking of his impression only,
and he learned later that some of the injured and dead                      hadgone
back      out    of    the tunnel.       The position was     resolved       by        the
witness saying that up to about 3.20 pm he was not                         aware        of
anybody going out that way.


The witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward commencing at pae
24 who took him through what he saw in 1988.                  This evidence was
very     much     as    described by others        herein.        Effectively          the
witness       was saying that in 1988 there was a sort of queue                        and
he     was    filtered     into the turnstiles as opposed            to     a     crowd
moving       about.     At page 16F Woodward succeeded'with               difficulty
in     obtaining from the witness that in 1988 there were probably
more     stewards       stopping       people   going into    the    tunnel           than
Police. Although the witness still said that it was Police and
stewards combined.


Then at page 27 Woodward switched to 1989 with the witness.                             He
pressed       the witness about publicity in the Anfield Review "not
to come if you have not got tickets", but the witness would not
accept       that this necessarily detered people from attending the
ground,      because     he      has   known turnstiles      to    open     on        such
occasions for people to pay over the counter.                 At page 27E this
witness was asked a question as to his expectation of the gates
being thrown open, and he responded that every supporter would
expect to pay if he could not get a spare ticket.
Woodward        then        directed    his    efforts to      obtaining        from       the
witness a response that people would do their best to get in in
any     event, but the witness said that he had not witnessed                              any
other method bar fair means of trying to get in.


The witness saw people carrying drinks and they either drink -up
the     drink        they     have got immediately before             going     into       the
ground,        or just drop it on the ground.               At page 28B the              Judge
intervened            to       say     that    he     attended the     ground       the    day
afterwards           and       saw     beer    cans     on the ground     side       of    the
turnstiles.


At     page     29 the witness said that he did not have                      any    qualms
about getting himself involved with the crowd at 2.30 pm.                                 This
at     page     29E.        At page 31 Woodward showed this              witness          some
pictures       which he did not identify verbally looking into pen 3
from     which       their appeared to be some space in pen                    3.        These
photographs          were     later identified as being              numbered       DB1629,
DB1630        and    DB1631     at     2.46.    At page 32D      there     is       dispute
between       Counsel        as to precisely which photographs                and        which
schedule        of     time is being referred to.            Mr Glasgow         told       the
Judge that bundle 2 was that which he had                     handed into the Judge
on     Thursday of           the previous week and the correct time had been
written       on     the opposite page.             It was eventually      established
that     DB1629 was I think at 2.46.                  At pages 32 and 33        Woodward
endeavoured to establish that the crowd had been filing in jtist
a     few more and just a few more into pen 3 when people                           started
saying go back because the situation changed.


At page 35 Woodward endeavoured to weaken this witness attitude
that     the authorities failed to become aware of the problems as
quickly as he, the witness had.


At     page 35D Woodward succeeded in getting this witness to draw
a    conclusion        that it was the side partitions that caused                         the
trouble.       At page 36B the witness agreed that the concentration
of     disaster        seemed    to get greater towards the             gate        in     the
perimeter    fence      to    the track, the gates were so          narrow    and
there were steps up to them.


At   page   36 Woodward tried to get the witness to                recover    the
witnesses     statements        that     some   Police   Officers     had     not
responded   to    the        situation   whereas    others   had     responded.
Effectively the witness stuck to his point on this that                      some
did and some did not.


The witness      was    cross      examined by Mr Glasgow      at    page     37.

Witness F J Eccleston cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.


Mr Glasgow at first took this witness through the timing of his
attendance at the match.                    At page 38 the witness confirmed that
by     the time he reached his position in pens 5 and 6 and looked
down     into pens 3 and 4 the people in 3 and 4 had already                                        been
joined        by     whoever had come down the tunnel from                              the    opening
gate.         Mr Glasgow told the witness that the gate was                                   actually
opened        at 2.47 p.m. and the witness accepted that he must have
been making his way onto the terraces probably at 2.48 p.m. or
2.49 p.m.


Mr     Glasgow        established with the witness from bundle 2 of                                  the
photographs           (possibly           photograph number 1 of that bundle                         the
transcript           is     unreadable) that in that photograph                            there     was
quite        a lot of room round a young man with a Scottish flag                                     by
gate     4     at     2.46     p.m. and at page 38                   G    that     at      photograph
DB.17/14        taken        at 15.00 hours there was solid                        density.          The
witness        said the time he got "to his seat" the teams were                                     not
out      the       witness         said    that the           time       he   reached         standing
position        and        judging from that the Liverpool side                            must     have
come out at about 2.53 p.m.                    This at page 39 E.


At    page      39     G     the witness says that he thinks                          he    saw     some
stewards       on      the     pitch perimeter mingled with the                            Police     in
yellow       tops he assumed because of the yellow jackets they were
stewards.            The     witness       at page 39 H              looked      at     photoggraph
PR.112/A       and         PR.21    and     identified the sort of                    men     he     saw
wearing       yellow jackets who he at the time of being                                   questioned
appreciated that they were in fact pressmen, not stewards.


The    witness         said that some of the yellow jerkined men he                                 saw
not    helping        might well have been pressmen and                           not       stewards.
The witness said that his statement was his own work and he had
received nobody else's assistance with it and re-stated at page
40     F that in 1988 he came through the turnstyles and saw     more
stewards    than Police Officers.   With regard to resolving      the
difference between Counsel as to whether there were more Police
than    Stewards across the tunnel in 1988 the witness said      that
it could have been his impression because possibly the         yellow
sticks impressed on his mind more.

Adam     James        Pemberton          is     a solicitor in             Sheffield           and        had
tickets        for     the north stand for the match on the 15th                                    April.
This     witness         said that he had made two statements one                                   almost
contemporaneous with the day the other taken by Police Officers
later.         Witness        sent one copy of the first one to his MP                                    one
copy     to the Inquiry and one copy to the Chief Constable of the
West Midlands Police.


This     witness parked about two miles from the ground in Walkley
and walked to the ground and ended up at the Penistone Road end
of     the ground which was a mistake.                          In all he and his                  friends
had     four      tickets and finished up at Penistone Road                                   at      about
2.30     p.m.         He had arranged to meet a friend at Leppings                                       Lane
gate     A at 2.30 p.m.              He was directed by Police along Penistone
Road     to the roundabout at Harries Road and then to turn left
down     Leppings Lane.              At Penistone Road turnstyles at that time
2.30     p.m. there             was a mixture of               Liverpool         and        Nottingham
Forest       supporters, people selling scarves and trinkets,                                        there
was     no disorder accept for people urinating.                                This at page               43
B.      He reached the roundabout at about 2.35 p.m. there was a
lot     of     people along Leppings Lane, people were                                not     running,
they     were asking for spare tickets the crowd was good humoured
but     the witness does not recall seeing any Policemen until                                             he
got     very     close        to the perimeter gates.                      He    recalls            Police
horses       towards the river, several Police horses.                                At that time
the     perimeter         gates       were opened and this                  witness         Pemberton
joined       on the back of the crowd of people.                            It was not a queue
of     any     sort     it was a mass.                He was going towards gate                      A     at
this     time since            they had their friend's ticket with them                                   and
they     were not          going      to find him the witness                    or     his         friend
offered the spareticket but nobody showed any                                   interest in it.


This    witness's           evidence          is similar to that                which       has          gone
before           in     getting         to       the turnstyles.     He     saw    foot       Police
Officers              effectively trapped in the crowd.                    Police at or            near
the turnstyles did not appear to have radios.                                This witness saw
some 10 or 12 Police Officers the ground side of the, turnstyles
on     foot           standing right over to the left in the                      corner.           The
witness           indicated            on    a    plan or some      other    device          to     the
Inquiry.           Near the exit gate.                  They seemed to be doing nothing.
At     page 46 D it is apparent from this witness's evidence                                       that
at     least          one of the turnstyle operators was trying to do                               his
job     because the person in front of this witness was told                                       "you
cannot           come       in   with this" and it was only a portion                        of     the
ticket.            The       apparent excuse was that the ticket                    had       become
torn     in the crush outside and there was a moment or two                                       delay
while        a     decision was made and the man was then                         let     through.
This     witness             with others tried to draw the attention                         of     the
Policemen             already          referred      to    as   standing     around          to     the
conditions outside the turnstyles. The response this                                         witness
received from the Police was he thinks abuse.


Page     47       C        this witness made his way to the north                       stand       saw
people        urinating            a     few      Police telling them        to     go       to     the
toilets.              At    page       47      G this     witness    gives    evidence            that
possibly
                                              This witness at page 48 noticed people
coming        over         the perimeter fence from the Leppings Lane                             stand
quite early.               This witness realised that something more serious
was     afoot          about       two       or three minutes        after    the       game        had
stopped.              He    drew this assumption by the fact that                       he     noted
people        just sitting or lying on the ground.                         It seemed to this
witness          to be a long time before anybody realised that anybody
was     in       serious         difficulty and a long              time    before       anything
started to happen to deal with it.


At    page        48       this witness Pemberton is                cross-examined           by     Mr
Hytner.          Mr Hytner allusidated that this witness at                          a football
match     expected to be able to do more than move his head around
and     move his hands when on the terraces and if he could not he
would consider it to be overcrowded.


The witness Pemberton was cross-examined by Mr Jackson starting
at     page     49        looking at photograph DB.30 14.46.                The    witness
described           the pen as very full.          At page 49 G it appears               that
the        witness's        first     statement    was    made       available     to     the
Inquiry.            He     had seen television and wanted to establish                    the
facts        against some wild things he had heard and wanted to                          get
it     on paper as quickly as possible.                  In his statement he             says
the        Police outside the big blue gates some on horseback seemed
to     be     doing nothing at all to control the crowd.                     He    saw     no
humour         or        drunkeness    outside     the    ground,      he   thought        it
reasonable           that     there    were not orderly          queues     outside       the
ground.   Jackson then took this witness through his travelling
time and movements.


At     page     51       this witness Pemberton is             cross-examined       by     Mr
Woodwood       who        effectively then took him through his                  evidence.
This witness heard nothing from the tannoy at all.                          Or anything
from a Policeman using a loud hailer from a landrover.                             At page
54     F    this     witness says that at the time he                 saw   the     police
horses       they were standing in a group at the back of the                           crowd
and he thought they would have made it worse at the front.


At     page 55 the witness Pemberton was further cross-examined by
Mr      Hytner           concerning     the     capability      of    the    electronic
scoreboard passing messages as well as scores but there were no
messages on the scoreboard and people were distressed that eyen
when        there         were    people      injured    the     scoreboard         showed
advertisements             for cars and timber.          It never at any time gave
any    indication of what had happened or what people should                             do.
The    witness also thought that the tannoy was inadequately used
this       witness        heard     two tannoy messages         one    something        like
"would        those        spectators      on   the     pitch    please     go     to    the
perimeter"          and another "would those spectators in the                     Lepping
Lane       terraces        please leave the terrace".            He heard no        tannoy
message       before        the disaster occurred.          The Inquiry          adjourned
    for lunch.

John     Randolph Tom Bartholomew lives
of     Sheffield and has done for 29 years he works at a
                             and     was at work on the morning of                        the    15th
April.       He left work at 2.07 p.m. and went into great detail as
to     his     route from work this witness is the gentleman who                                  was
with     Mrs      Sweet and his evidence really runs parallel                               to    the
evidence        given by the witness Mrs Sweet.                        However at page 61 E
this     witness did say that when the gates did open                                (presumably
the    gate by the turnstyles) "everybody that was sat outside or
stood on the bridge or made a dash to the gates".


The witness Bartholomew                    was cross-examined               by     Mr     Woodwood
commencing on page 62.


This     witness's         evidence reinforces th'e evidence of Mrs                             Sweet
concerning         the bad behaviour of the crowd, the drunkeness                                 and
the disregard by the crowd of Police instructions.

Judith        Watson        lives in the area of                                   and     briefly
this        witness       heard crowds saying to her where is the                          nearest
open        pub and they were running along the time being about 1.15
p.m.        heading       away        from the ground a the             time.        The      Police
seemed        to be near the public houses up Halifax Road the                                    crowd
was asking for tickets.                     This witness was in the store Gateways
buying        some beer, Gateways own brand and the fans were                                  saying
we     want something stronger Pilsner lager.                          They appeared to be
going        for     the strongest beers they could.                     Some      had     carrier
bags containing two or three packs and some had the same amount
in     their        arms.           This    occurred quite early in               the     day      the
witness went home for lunch and then went to the match herself.
She        had tickets for the Nottingham Forest end in the Kop.                                   The
crowd        going      down Pennistone Road Notts Forest fans had had                                a
drink        but just seemed a good friendly crowd.                         There was a            big
crowd        and there were signs of alcohol but nothing to what                                    she
had        seen     at the supermarket.              She had no        difficulty          getting
into        Pennistone Road end more or less walked straight                               through
the        turnstyle.            At page 65 G this witness describes what                          she
could         see      from the Kop end and her first impression was that
the crowd had invaded the pitch over the barriers.                                  This was at
a     time     when      the        match     had been stopped.             She     saw       a    few
Liverpool           fans on the pitch coming in the direction of the Kop
and        Forest fans started chanting at Liverpool fans thinking it
was        a pitch invasion and one or two Forest fans probably                                   four
broke        down     the        pitch      and were waving         their       fists      at      the
Liverpool           fans and yelling at them but they were soon                            cleared
off.       This at page 66 A.               At page 66 B the witness said when it
was     obvious         there was trouble the Forest fans quietened                               down
and the           Police         put a cordon right across the pitch                     to       stop
this.


(It    will        be recalled that other witnesses have referred to                                 a
P o lic e cordon r ig h t a c o r ss   th e p itc h ).


The     witness     Watson was cross-examined by Mr Hytner.                It     was
obvious     to this witness from the Kop end that the central                     two
pens     behind     the Liverpool goal were very full.               At 2.50     p.m.
when she reached her position in the Kop she was surprised that
no     one seemed to be going in the pens at the side.                   Everybody
seemed     to pack into the middle pens.                  The witness Watson is     a
Liverpool       supporter     she lives near the ground but has                always
supported       Liverpool.      This witness at page 68 C said that               the
surge     she     saw   behind the Leppings Lane end occurred              or     was
coincidental       with Peter Beardsley hitting the crossbar at                   the
Kop end.


The     witness    Watson     was      cross-examined by        Mr   Jackson    this
witness     got two tickets the day before the match from a friend
of a friend who works at the ground.                     She said if necessary she
could     help a little more as to the exact source.                 This at page
68 F.


The    witness     Watson was cross-examined by Mr Woodwood to                  whom
she    confirmed that the surge in pens 3 and 4 was                  coincidental
with the attack on the goal at the Kop end.

Duncan        Sturrock is a bus driver for South Yorkshire                                 transport
and     lives in                                                              he was on duty on
15th        April and left home for work at 8.30 a.m. and walked                                        the
15 or 20 minutes to the bus depot.                        The bus depot is on Berries
Road        junction of Leppings Lane and Halifax Road.                               As he walked
to     work     he     saw     3 hire vans mini             buses        at    three         separate
locations         on    the route in each van there were 12/15                               football
fans,        Liverpool        supporters,         large numbers of                 cans      of        beer
packed        up in the back of the seats with cushions and coats                                        on
top     of     them.      This apparently was the situation in all                                 three
vans and most of the fans were drinking at that time, at one of
the     vans      a    couple of the lads asked him if he                            had     got        any
tickets        for     the     match       he had not.          Whilst        he     was     working
driving        his bus during the morning he was asked by a couple of
Liverpool supporters whether he had got any spare tickets or if
he     knew     where they could get some.                      This happened on              several
other        occasions.         As he drove his bus he saw large groups                                  of
people        standing outside the pubs drinking and this was unusual
and     he     had only observed it on one other big match                                 occasion.
This     was approximately 2 p.m.                  The witness saw quite a lot                          of
Police about. There were 4 or 5 Police Officers outside                                            most
of the pubs he passed.


The witness was cross-examined by Mr Woodwood he was questioned
about       the actual quantity of the beer he saw and he                                  estimated
400/500 cans of beer to a van.                            The        argument        being        12/15
persons. This at page 71 G.

This witness examined by Mr Goldsack said that she lived in the
vicinity            of     the Hillsborough ground and is used to                               seeing          a
build         up of crowds on match days people arrived from about                                             10
a.m.         onwards        she        saw people just drinking out of                         cans,          her
impression            was        that        there were very few Police                    Officers            in
the     Leppings            Lane          area     to    what there          normally          is       for     a
semi-final.                There          had     been a lot more            the       previous          year.
This         witness        describes the number of Police as about 4                                    or     5
mounted            Police        and        probably about half a dozen                    Police            just
milling            about up and down the road.                       To the Judge this witness
said         that normally the Police stand probably one at each house
but there was nobody there.                             By normally she meant previous cup
tie occasions.


The witness was not cross-examined but Mr Hytner with the Judge
recorded the thanks expressed to local residents for assistance
in      hundreds            of        statements         taken       by    Hytner's           instructing
solicitors.               Jackson joined in with this.


The     witness            Dawes          was     cross-examined           by     Mr      Woodwood            who
questioned            her quite fully about Police presence.                                  He compared
with her 1988 with 1989 situations.                                At page 74 F he challenged
the     witness            as        to the practice she had described                        about           men
posted in the sort of positions all along Leppings Lane but the
witness            stuck        to     her point.          This witness thought                that           the
throng         towards           the ground along Leppings Lane was                           decreasing
getting            closer        to 2.45 p.m. but at 2.45 p.m. about 50                                 or     so
fans         ran     down        Leppings Lane singing this at page 75                              G        this
witness            describes           at       page 78 D that the            crowd        running            and
singing            down     Leppings Lane joined onto the end of                              the       crowd
round         the gateway they were quiet at first but when it got                                             to
2.55         p.m.     everybody seemed to want to get into see the                                      match
and they started pushing and shoving and nobody was getting in.
She     did not see the Police landrover she saw mounted Policemen
there     were about 3 mounted Police together in the corner.    She
saw     about a dozen fans trying to climb the blue railings.    She
saw     people   trying to climb over the blue railings and   Police
making them get down at about 2.50 p.m.

Albert Lindley lives in                                                            Sheffield and
has     done      for      some        51 years he is used               to     seeing football
supporters           attending         matches        he     is in charge of
                                                                                                      He
was                                       from about 12 o'clock his                     reason      for
being      there       was      to keep the fans off from urinating
               and     also to stop cars parking
        He had little trouble with cars parking there were only
3 and they moved off when asked. He was told,by his wife that
about 10 fans had been urinating


He    could       hear the noise from inside the ground from where                                    he
was     and     noticed         that it went a little quiet                      just     before       3
o'clock        and at 3 o'clock he heard a roar from the crowd,                                   page
81 A and B the witness Lindley said that after the cheers there
was     a huge mass of people running from Wadsley Bridge area                                       or
running       along the lane all eager to get in running as fast                                     as
they could he said it might be an exaggeration but he estimated
about 1,000.    At page 81 D this witness says that he walked
across the road    ____________________ towards the ground to see
what was happening and saw a large mass of people already
outside the ground and all the lot he had previously                                        referred
to had joined them.


The    witness         Lindley was cross-examined by Mr                          Woodwood        under
cross-examination this witness agreed that "just as though                                             a
trainload had just come in".

Ian Brown is a Police Constable and a member of South Yorkshire
Police and                 also    a resident near to the                 Hillsborough             ground
living in                                   and was off
so    was         at       home in                           most of the day.               He      went
shopping in Hillsborough which meant going up Leppings Lane and
through           Hillsborough Park area and Middlewood Road setting off
at    about            1 o'clock and returned about,2.15 p.m. to 2.20                               p.m.
Shortly             after 1 o'clock            he saw a few hundred                 fans     at       the
entrance           to      the    ground mainly Liverpool supporters there                           was
quite        a          lot of evidence of drink he                    said    he    thought         the
majority were drinking mostly young to middle aged.                                      On his way
towards           the       shops he saw some disorderly behaviour, only                             one
incident             when        a group of about 8 Liverpool                  supporters           near
Dykes        Lane          were shouting and swearing and what he would                             have
considered              to be drunk and disorderly.                    This between 1.30 p.m.
and 1.45 p.m. There was no cross-examination of this witness.
There was a short adjournment.
DISCUSSION         p a g e 83 o f v o l u m e 2 o f DAC b u n d l e o f t r a n s c r i p t s     -
T u e s d a y 2 3 r d May 1 9 8 9 a f t e r n o o n    se ssio n .


After a short adjournment and prior to calling the first Police
witness         Chief      Superintendent Mole Mr Woodwood                  addressed           the
Judge      seeking to establish his situation whereby (NHB's words)
Police       Officers          were      not taken by           surprise   by    accusations
against         them.         Also seeking some indication of the                    witnesses
likely       to be called some 2 or 3 days in advance.                          In    response
to    this Lord          Justice Taylor said that he was sympathetic with
Mr    Woodwoo's            suggestions as far as it could be complied with
and suggested that Mr Woodwood and Mr Collins liaise about it.


The     Judge said with regard to specific points of criticism                                   if
there are any he felt the general nature of any expected points
had     already been indicated in letters which have been                              written
by    Counsel        for       the Inquiry if anything crops up                  during         the
course       of the evidence of a witness or after he finsihed which
makes      it     desirable that he should be recalled that                          would       be
done.


Woodwood          referred          to    the         recommendations      of   the         Royal
Commission         in     response to which                the Judge said that this was
not     strictly         a 1921 Act Tribunal but nevertheless he hadtried
to approach the matter in the same way as a matter of fairness.


Er    Woodwood          was    clearly not entirely satisfied that                     he       had
achieved sufficient protection for all his police witnesses, Mr
Collins gave him some solace.                         At the end of this discussion Mr
Collins called Chief Superintendent Mole.

Brian        Leonard         Mole       is a Chief Superintendent                    in     the    South
"Yorkshire Police                     currently    the Divisional Commander                       of the
Barnsley           Division            having been appointed to that post                         on the
27th         March 1989 and he was taken through his CV.                                  At page 86 D
this witness gives evidence of having been Staff Officer to the
Chief          Constable          including       arrangements            for        royal        visits
planning           of major events within the force area which had                                     been
established             in    1974       and this included to some                    extent       crowd
control.            Between           1976 and 1979 he was Deputy                    Sub-Divisional
Commander for the Central Division which included the Sheffield
United         Football Ground and he was responsible for the policing
of      football         matches at that ground and for the                           planning          and
arrangement              of various matches and demonstrations in the                                  City
he      said       at    that          time they had far             greater         crowds       at the
Sheffield United Stadium than probably they do today.


At     page        87 he gives evidence concerning his transfer                                   to    the
research           and       development department in 1979                     with        particular
responsibility                for      planning public order training and                         policy
and      in       October        1979 he was promoted                to    Superintendent               and
appointed           head       of      the newly formed Operations                    Division          and
almost            immediately had to handle the steel strike.                               At page 87
this         Officer continues with his evidence about his                                  experience
 and     between October 1985 and March of this year he was in                                          the
Division           which had responsibility for Hillsborough and at                                     the
 foot of page 87 H he says he had overall responsibility for the
planning            of operations at Sheffield Wednesday football                                 ground
 in conjunction with his Sub-Divisional Commander he became very
 familiar with Hillsborough football ground.                                At page 88 he says
 that        generally           he    is   concerned with            fairly         small        numbers
 attending          matches at Hillsborough except where there is a                                     big
 team        coming such as Liverpool or Manchester.                            It is very             rare
 that        he     gets a crowd sufficient to fill the away side of                                    the
Hillsborough          ground.        The away side is at Leppings                  Lane       end
which     incorporates west stand, Leppings Lane terraces and                                 the
north west section this is normally used for visitors.                                  At page
88 F this witness gives some historical reasons for signs still
being     present at the west end saying on the turnstyles                               "home"
and "away" at page 89 there is some detailed descriptions as to
the     construction           of   the     ground and the       position          of      metal
fencing.       (NHB does not think that he can usefully summarise the
details       of     the      ground      as given by     this     witness         but       will
endeavour to point out possible particular problems).


At      page 90 F            this witness refers to a        problem          of     lack      of
clarity       in the signing at the turnstyles and in the                          ticketing
at      page 90 G this witness says that he                      has    certainly            made
references         to      that     problem    over     previous       matches          seeking
particularly            for colour coding for easy identification by                          the
club which of course falls to their responsibility to deal with
ticket and allocation but he has given advice on that area.                                    At
page 90 H there is reference to on this occasion there being A,
C,     B, which does not help because A was 1-10, C was 11-16 both
on     the     lefthand side of a dividing barrier.                    B was       A-G.        At
page     91A this            witness said that he had        no knowledge               of    the
tickets       being allocated in that way but if the signs above the
gates        do not coincide then clearly that would casue confusion.
On      page 90 Mr Collins explores the frustration                       which          their
witness        agreed        such numbering and lettering would cause.                         At
page     91 E Collins put to this witness that the marking of                                 the
tickets        and the turnstyles and the clarity of such                          respective
markings        should have been taken into account and                       specifically
considered           and     liaised      by   the Police    with       the        club.       In
response        to this the witness said that to his knowledge it had
not     been a problem the previous year and effectively he had no
knowledge          of it.      He had put his mind to more forceful                      colour
and     he thought that there was an improvement this year on                                 the
colour        side      of    it.    The problem the previous            year        and      the
failure        to mark tickets at Liverpool or Nottingham Forest ends
and this witness's understanding was that it was put on Kop and
terraces           tickets           but     not in the stands.        At page 92         B     this
■witness said that the clarity of the markings of the turnstyles
■was    considered              by     him      the previous year and         there       was     no
difficulty               thus        he considered that there should have been                    ho
difficulty               in approaching the correct turnstyles this year                          he
had     not appreciated the "A, C, B" and not "A, B, C" he did not
know     why he said that.                   Page 92 C this witness said that there
had     been        no       liaison between the Police and               the     club        about
markings           of     the       turnstyles except the            colour     coding.          The
matter        of        ticket       printing       producing    has     always       been       the
responsibility                of     the     club which they have carried              out       the
function           for.       The evidence of this witness continues on                         page
92     and 93 in relation to the geographical considerations taken
into     account             regarding the segregation of fans.                   Effectively
the     club        coming from the north got the west and north                            stands
and     the club coming from the south got the south and Kop.                                     At
page     93        C, D & E the witness explains the reasoning                         and       the
position           of     roads       and approach roads to the ground                 for       the
positioning             of      segregated supporters within the                ground.           At
page     93     G       this witness agreed that such an approach                         from     a
geographical              point       of     view results in imbalance           of       seating
where     with          the large size of the Kop compared with                       the      west
area the Kop accommodates something in the region of 21,000 and
"the west end 10,000 on the standing areas plus 4,400 odd on the
west      seating            area.         At     page   95   this    witness         discusses
segregation and buffer areas of neutral suporters.                               That is the
intention          with        regard        to internal      segregation.          The       other
segregation             is     to     try to avoid       confrontation        between          fans
outside        the        ground.          This     witness   discusses       his     attitude
towards        the routes by the fans by road and rail to the ground.
At     their       approach           to the ground from car parks              and       railway
stations.At             page       96 D this witness gives evidence                           to the
effect     that           one of the reasons that fans prefer                   to arrive by
road     as opposed to by train is that they cannot bring drink on
the     trains the number of trains between this year and previous
years     was        discussed and there has been a marked reduction                             in
the     number          of fans arriving by train.              The Police          have       some
control           over        coaches    and efforts are made by the       Police    to
restrict           alcoholic drinks on coaches.            This witness's aim       was
to        have "the serials" (presumably Police Officers) deployed on
foot at static points at the end of each road junction and fans
are        kept        from     going    down side roads   as   far   as    possible.
Endeavours are made to see that fans are not drinking too much.


Page 98 in the transcript is blank and that evidence is lost to
us    .
At        Page 99 there is continued evidence concerning the approach
to        crowd        control in the approach roads to Sheffield            and    the
a P P r o a c h    roads to the ground and with regard to the importance
of        segregation and at page 100 A this Officer witness believes
that        the risk of changing the ground around so far as the ends
are concerned the risks would be too great and it should remain
in the split that he had achieved.


Continuing on page 100 there is consideration of the 1988 match
and at 100 D this witness states that when the decision to hold
a     semi-final is made he as Divisional Commander is                     approached
fry       the club to see if he would be prepared to stage that event
or        police that event.              His response to that is "yes, we       would
be        prepared          to police     it on the terms of segregation     I     have
described" if that is not acceptable to the FA or the club then
it would not go ahead.                   He said that that was the only input he
would        have and that conversation in 1988 took place and whilst
appeals           were made for it to be reversed he merely repeated the
reasons           he    had        given in evidence that day as to the      way     he
would        wish to police it.            At page 100 G it is quite clear from
what       the witness says that it was his or a police decision                     to
have       Liverpool           at the end they were and Nottingham Forest            at
the       Kop      end.        On    1988 there were   representations      for     the
allocation             to     be    theother way around but he made        the     same
arguments and they were accepted.


This       witness said that the same question arose in 1989 and                     he
made     the     same ruling.          This Officer was aware that           Liverpool
had     made       representations         to the FA concerning the           lack     of
tickets        allocated        to   Liverpool     this at    page    102     A.      The
witness        would not accept that a "greater problem" was                   created
concerning        people        arriving without tickets due to the                ground
allocation        because        he would have been hopeful that any               right
thinking        person        using common sense would not attempt             such       a
venture.         This at page 102 C.         At page 103 C it was put to the
"witness       that while sympathising with his hopes his                   experience
as     a Police Officer must have surely taught him that hope                        was
not     always fulfilled.            In response to this he said he honestly
believed        that the vast majority of people responded and                     would
respond     to the appeals he has made.               This witness then said he
thought     that he thought the attitude and behaviour of fans had
improved and it appears that he relied upon this improvement in
the     decisions        he    made.     At page     104   the -Officer       witness
considers some under-employment of his forces in the 1988 event
and     he considers the deployment of some of his forces at                        page
104     E to H.     At page 105 B he says there was little change                      in
Ms      plans       as between 88 and 89.            At page 105 Dthis        Officer
says     that he had no knowledge of complaints of overcrowding on
the     terraces on the west terraces in 1988 but at 105 F he said
"often     fans will try and seek to be behind the goal to get the
best     vantage    point and put the crush into that type of                      area.
The     witness gave evidence that his random checking for tickets
by     his Officers took place in 1987 with Coventry and Leeds and
again     in 1988 and he followed the same policy this year so far
as     ticket    checking        was    concerned.    At     page    106    there     is
discussion         of     the traffic problems experienced. Atpage                  107
concerning       public        house policy whereby public houses             in     the
vicinity of the stadium are asked either to close or use a rear
door policy and refuse to allow supporters in tends to push the
problem outwards and supporters obtain alcohol further afield.


Effectively       this witness concluded that it was not possible to
overcome the problem of drinking by supporters prior to                            their
arriving at the ground.
This     witness stated at page 108 E that he had delayed kick-off
in     1987 because of late arrival due to traffic problems                        which
he     said       that        he had himself created to some         extent      by    the
introduction             of     checking vehicles to a much         greater      extent.
There        is discussion by the witness at page 109 as to the                       time
he     gave the order to delay kick-off in 1987 and his experience
in     1987       outside the Leppings Lane entrance and a bottle                     neck
that occurs at the Leppings Lane entrance.


The witness said that the question of delaying kick-off did not
arise        in    1988       and said the policy is for him to           assess       the
problems          being       faced   and whether or not he would          cause       any
difficulty          by     not    going on with the match until           later.        He
would take into account all the factors based on looking at the
number of people outside because this Officer operates "out and
about"        and if he sees that a build-up is occurring sees how it
is      moving           then    based     on   his    assessment   together          with
information from twelve sector Commanders he makes his decision.


At     page 110 he describes his practice of spending time in                          the
control room looking at the video cameras and also going out to
look     as well he relies on Superintendent Murray in the control
zoom     and       his     sector Commanders and he         operates      upon     their
assessment          and       abilities     together    with his    own   views        and
perceptions          of what was being experienced.            His style         however
is     to be on the move as well as in the control room.                      He      will
spend time on the perimeter track, always time in Leppings Lane
and     Pennistone Road and in between that time visit the control
room     etc.       By about 2.50 p.m or 2.55 p.m. he would normally be
at     the    players tunnel.             He would always be in radio         contact.
In     1988 he had problems with radio communications from a local
radio        station      so far as communication between Officers                 there
was     none.       This witness normally speaks to the referee about a
half     hour or forty minutes before kick-off as to the kinds                          of
policies          and demarcation lines which would apply on the                   pitch
area.        In    brief "the pitch is yours, the rest of it is mine".
At     page     111 D this witness describes that his experience                           has
been that at first he is to think the crowd would not go in and
he     looked        at the crowd and now with experience knows that                        it
vill     go in.           (NHB note - this attitude in that position                     could
be     very     telling).              He quoted he had the same          experience        as
coming to Mr Murray in the control room.


Again     at        page        111    G this witness     states     concerning          other
considerations which affect his judgment as to whether to delay
M c k - o f f "if you have 21,000 people on the Kop who have arrived
in good time, already to go, and you are then having to look at
a     delay, you have that consideration to take in as well as the
consideration              that       those outside who have not          arrived".        At
page     112        he     discusses        his decision for       not    having     Police
Officers actually on the terraces in a capacity crowd situation
because        they        would simply get swallowed up in the               crowd       and
their     effectiveness disappears.                 Again at this page he recalls
the     disposal           of his forces.        The witness says he is            familiar
with     and        took on board the ACPO Sub-Committee Report                     on    the
Guide     to        Policing Football and further ACOP Sub-Committee                       on
Hooliganism at Sporting Events Guide                         to    Policing        Football
published in October 1987.


At page 112 H Mr Collins put to this witness document No. 12 in
the     first of the exhibit volumes and referred him to paragraph
1.40     and        asked him to read to himself paragraphs 1.40 -                       1.49
starting        at entrance to the ground dealing with turnstyles and
queuing        at        page    113      quoting from the    exhibit       relating       to
monitoring by Police and stewards and the recommended amount 'of
Officers        available             .... frustration at turnstyles          if     queues
remain     after           the     game    has started.      Orderly       control       room
minimise risk.              The witness said I think there is a possibility
of     problems           if you have not order outside, yes sir.               This       at
page     113        C.     At      page 114 the question of         queuing     and       the
failure        to        achieve      this at the 1989 match at          turnstyles        is
covered        also        the searching of supporters and               handling     other
public     order offences and protection of public order                        offences
across         the    board.        Police Officers appointed             to achieve
this desired result were under the command of Chief                                 Inspector
Creaser on this occasion. This at page 114 E.


On the point of responsibilities for ground command at page 114
F   this       witness       expressed       the opinion      that     ground         command
extended         rather       to    the     perimeter      fence     rather         than   the
turnstyles          and apparently therefore under the jurisdiction and
command        of a Mr Greenwood overall on the ground.                    The       witness
delineates          the responsibilities between the two Officers.                          At
page     115    C     the     witness       states that      the    approach         to    the
turnstyles           is     clearly       under    the    command    of    the       outside
Commander.           Once they arrive at the stadium the crowd                       becomes
part     of the command area of the ground command but there is                              a
blurring       of    areas       at the turnstyle location.               This       witness
would     not accept the suggestion that it is of vital importance
that     there is someone in overall charge of ensuring that there
is order at the approach to the turnstyles and that can only be
done     by    starting at a distance away and carrying                        it    through
right     up    to the turnstyles.              The witness goes into detail                at
page     115    D    E     and     F as    to     the    delineation      of    Officers'
responsibility            over     that area.       The witness is experience               at
Sheffield Wednesday was that he had never seen the need to have
people     queue far beyond the area under discussion.                         It appears
that the area under discussion was probably only just to                                   the
perimeter gates or very little outside there.

At page 116E the witness Mole says "I do not think we ever                                              had
any     anticipation              that      such a large number                of        people       would
arrive        at        the     last     minute.        At       page    117D        he     says       "the
arrangements              for     turnstiles          is     a      matter          of    the      Club's
responsiblity                 and their ability to accommodate                       those        numbers
of     people           which they offer tickets to is                    firmly          upon        their
responsibility.                 At     page     117H       and 118A it          is       put     to    the
witness           that    the turnstiles were inadequate.                        His       reply        was
"that is not true, in so far as the fact that in 1987 the                                              same
numbers           were    accommodated;               1988        the     same        numbers          were
accommodated             and     it     was         merely    a     change       in       behavioural
attitude           as     far as I am aware that caused the                          difficulty          on
this occasion, and not the facilities that were available.


At     page 119B the witness refers to the "Green Guide" reference
to     750     people an hour going through turnstiles when money                                        is
changing hands.                His discussion with the Secretary of Sheffield
Wednesday           in    the        past     had     indicated         that     turnstiles            can
accommodate something in the region of 1000 in an hour                                            in     an
all ticket situation.


At     page        119    Mole       deals with        his       expectation             that     people
attended responsibly at the match, the lack of entertainment is
raised        by    Counsel          and     the Officer thought                that           music and
singing        together          is enough atmosphere to                  encourage             them    to
attend.


At     page        120 at the centre of the pages the letters                                   have not
been     reproduced,             the     Judge       refers       to     the    tickets           saying
"quarter           of     an     hour       before",       Mole        agreed       but     said       his
advertising             asked     them to come much before that.                               There was
discussion as to whether Liverpool fans have a tendancy to turn
up late.

At    page 121 Counsel returns to paragraph 1.44 of the               document
produced       regarding    supporters   trying   to   get    into     another
section than that related to their ticket.


The      colour   coding was intended to assist this.         This at     page
12 ID.

300-400       Liverpool fans had filtered onto the Kop with             tickets
and      these    were segregated by a line of officers by the            North
stand.        This at 121F.    On page 122 a constant        battle     against
ticket        touts is referred.    It was accepted that       ticket     touts
were      a    problem.    They can only be arrested    for     obstruction,
not for selling tickets.


The inquiry was adjourned at this point until 10.00 am.

Was recalled and further examined by Mr Collins.


The       witness         re-established            that      the     plan     for        1989        was
essentially            the same as that introduced in 1987, and that                                  the
plan      was      devised        by    Mr     Mole      in     consultation         with         other
Officers.              The ultimate decision over the plan rested with the
assistant Chief Constable of Operations, a Mr Jackson.                                       At page
2F      the     witness is referred to document 11 which is the                                   South
Yorkshire              Standing        Instructions           for    Policing        of     football
matches,         this      iminated from the aforesaid Mr Jackson                            and       is
dated         March         1986.        Updating         the       Yorkshire        Instructions
 following         the Popplewell Report.                  At page 3 the use of                  police
 horses       is dealt with and it was the intention, although not in
 the     guidelines           of document 11 that police horses be                          used       to
 assist       in       the formation of queues at                    turnstiles.           This       was
 dealt with at the briefing.                      This at page 3D.


 Inspector         Hans-Davies           was in control of the mounted                      section.
 There        is discussion at page 4 of the chain of command                                related
 to police horses.


 At     page 5 there is reference to the spoter plan being used                                         in
 1988      for      traffic.        There was no spoter plan in 1989.                         It       was
 not      felt      to    be     necessary.            The use        of   a    plan        had       been
 considered and decided against.


 At     page       6     document       11 (standing            instructions)          is        further
 considered.             At     paragraph         9.1      "traffic flow",           and         it    was
 accepted by the Officer that conjestion is anticipated.


 There        is discussion at page 7 concerning the intention of                                      the
  standing         instructions           to encourage late arrivals to                      minimise
  the     time during which pre-match disorder problems could ari§e.
This    came     from       the     Popplewell      inquiry       but   the     witness's
intention           had     always    been    to    get     the    spectators         in      in
sufficient time to get in.

At     page 7F, page 24 of document 11 is referred to in                            relation
to the use          of tannoyor public address systems.


Mr     Mole    found       the    tannoy to be useful and           had       an override
facility       in     the police control room.              The tannoy        was     tested
pre-match       to ensure that all areas are covered by the                          system.
The     witness       said       that at particularly at           large      crowds        the
tannoy is not as distinctive as other times.                        This at page 8B.


At page 8F          Mole said that he had never consideredutilizing the
electronicscoreboard for important announcements                           and he had no
knowledge       as     to    who     activates that.          He    used      the     public
address       system,        and had never found need for               the     electronic
scoreboard.

This     officer is not aware as to whether the tannoy can be used
to make announcements at seperate parts of the ground isolating
the     system       from     the    rest of the ground, but             he     had        never
experienced any necessity for this.                   This at page 9C.


At     page    9G there was entertainment-youth football before                              the
game     in    1988.         At page 11 there was a consideration                     of     the
layout of the ground and the signs placed about the ground.


At     page 11C regarding the signs available to various                            parts     of
the     ground        the witness says at the semi-finals they                       did     not
 find    a difficulty because you were filling the entire area and
people generally arrived and milled into the food areas and the
toilet        areas       before finding their level of entrance                    into the
 stadium.        At       page H E the witness appears to assume                    that the
 vast     majority          have     been    to    league     matches      at    Sheffield
 Wednesday       previous to their attendance at the semi-final.                              At
 page     11H he says that however he thinks the sign posting could
be    improved.        At page 12A the witness agrees that sign posting
is virtually nonexistent.               At page 12C the witness said that he
had    not had any words with the Club about sign posting, he had
not previously seen it as a problem.                 The witness now says that
it could be improved.                At page 13C the capacity of pen 3 is put
at    1,200 and pen 4 at 1,000.              The witness could only rely upon
visual    experience as to how many people were in those pens                        at
any one time.


At     page    13F Mole says that his experience has been                that the
capacities       for         those    pens have found their own level,         if     a
difficulty is seen then he would take what action was necessary
to erase the problem.


At     page    14 an incident which occurred at the             ground     on       the
11th     April        1981     when    people were   injured   was     dealt    with
resulting        in     the subsequent erection of certain           barriers         at
the ground.


At page 15F the witness accepts that the scenario between                           1981
and     1989     seems similar for the 1981 incident            there     were        no
radial fences.


At page 16 the ground computer is referred to which only                        gives
a     warning that you are within 15% of capacity and that                     is     in
respect of the ground as a whole.


At     page    15 there         is discussion of     the   benefitof    having
tickets        for particular terraces and for particular                pens        and
also     the difficulties in enforcing such a system.                  At 16P        the
witness        accepted that defective signing would cause               confusion
to late arrivals.              At page 17C, D and E the witness deals               with
the     manner in which he intended to deal with               the     recognition
of the difference between a pitch invasion on the one hand                           and
a     problem     arising on the other.          Affectively if you       use        the
 same officers in the same positions on the ground so that                          they
might be better able to distinguish one from the other.
At page 18 there is a discussion as to whether the                           operational
order    over-emphasised                 the   prevention of   climbing        over        the
fencing rather than the cause of climbing over the fencing.


At page 19A the witness states that the "communications                               linked
between the police room and the sergeant at the perimeter is                                  a
matter of a couple of minutes at the most to get to him".                               This
arose     out of a discussion related to the availability of                            loud
hailers.


At     page        19     there     is reference to page       42     of    document         11
relating           to stewards and their duties.           At page 20A          Mr.     Mole
says     that           the stewards are briefed by         inspectors         on     sector
duties        on        each    match.     I would say that     the        deployment        of
stewards           is      a      matter       for   the   Club.           Stewards     have
communications                 through the chief steward who has a             link        into
police control and the police have one of their radios so                                  that
stewards can communicate with police control direct in addition
to their own facilities.


At page 23 Counsel finishes his questioning of the witness Mole
concerning planning and subsequently turns to the question                                  the
fact     that           Chief     Superintendant      Duckinfield      took     over        the
policing of the 1989 event.                     NHB would here mention that I have
drawn     attention              as far as possible to what I consider                to     be
important points raised in Brian Mole's evidence as to planning
but if the real need arises this witness's evidence in relation
to his planning could well be read in detail.
Cont ... evidence of Mr. Mole
At page 24 of the transcript
•The appointment of Chief Superintendant Duckinfield
for the policing of Hillsborough and that officers
experience is considered.



At page 24G there is evidence concerning a meeting on the                    27th
March     1989 with various individuals and authorities           when        Mr.
Mole     affectively briefed Mr. Duckinfield upon his takeover                  of
the operations.


Mr.     Duckinfield     having taken over responsibilities         from       Mr.
Mole     made his own decision about manpower but had the               benefit
of     the same planning team in 1989 as that used in 1988.                  This
at page 25F.


On the day in question the witness, Brian Mole, was in his                     own
division in Barnsley on 24 hour cover.


M r . Mole hearing of the incident on the radio attended Hamilton
Road     police     station at about twenty past four      contacted          Mr.
Duckinfield in the control box and offered assistance.                   Having
deployed        police officers who had responded to a      general          call
at Hamilton Road police station he visited the ground at                     about
5pm.      At     page   27 Mr. Mole describes his    attendance         at    the
control box at about 5.15 he was asked to take over               operations
at the location whilst Mr. Duckinfield and Mr. Jackson who                    had
taken     all     the action needed to be implimented at         that        stage
■went    to     update the chief constable.   At page 28     the        officer
touches upon his activities once he had taken over.


At page 28 the witness, Mole, was cross-examined by Mr. Glasgow
out of Counsel's normal order.


Mr.     Glasgow     explained that he had given     Mr.   Mole     documents
■which    had been extracted from the files at the Club which                  had
not     found their way into somebody else's bundle,                                 he    produced
those        documents to the inquiry and explained that the                                officer
had had the benefit of reading them over night.


From page 29 onwards until I mentioned another page Mr. Glasgow
explored           with Mr. Mole the liaison and cooperation                           which       had
occured           between       the        Club    and Mr.     Mole     with        various       Club
secretaries              and particularly with Club secretary Mr.                          Mackrell
when     there had been free constructive criticisms made in                                      both
directions.               The fine line between containment and control                             of
crowds        on        the one hand and freedom of movement and                          means     of
escape        on        the other were discussed.                  There was        reference       to
documentation              which was before Mr. Mole regarding an                          incident
which        had        occured       in     1986, the       12th     March     of     that       year
concerning the                 closing        of    the    elevated      standing          area     of
Leppings Lane.


Page 31A.


Mr. Glasgow intended to use this point as an example.                                      At     page
32D     the witness's responses imply that a decision to                                   close     a
particular              area of the terraces rested with the police but                             at
page 32F the police officer said that he would probably have to
give     way to the Club if the Club insisted unless he felt                                      that
he had to refer to legislation with a view to seeking a ban                                         on
the match going forward.                      Later at page 33H this is                reinforced
by     the        witness saying the commanding officer                        on    the        ground
should        have a direct control over what was being done                                by     his
officers as to the use of the areas of the ground.                                   At page        34
there        is     a     discussion of other situations                 where        there       was
cooperation             but     the police tended to have the last                        word     and
decision.          At page 36 there is reference to meeting which                                 took
place between the Club, other authorities and the police.


At     page 7 there is reference to formal training                                 sessions       and
adhoc    meetings              for     each        match     and    reference        to     regular
practices           for       the     evacuation procedure.             At     page        37E    the
■witness       refers           to     evacuation    procedures          being        sprung           on
stewards and the police twice this season before this                                      tragedy.
Reference is made to coded messages which can be broadcast over
the     tannoy           system which would alert all stewards                       and        police
officers           bringing them to attention to alert                    pending           further
information              and     all     gates should     be     manned,        unlocked              and
opened.            This        at page 37G.      These evacuation             procedures              are
discussed           further at page 38 and the fact that the police                                   can
override           the tannoy system from the control room at                             page        39D
and     E     deals       with the appointment of Mr. Locke                     by        the     Club
following his retirement from the police.                             At page 40 there                 is
reference           to     a further document emphasising                 the        cooperation
■which      the police had enjoyed from the Club.                        At page 41              there
is     a discussion of speed of supporters through turnstiles                                         and
at     4 IE    there is evidence of the police decision to                                take        out
twelve        turnstiles              from   operation.        This     apparently              has     a
balancing           operation          of ingress.      (NHB noted that              it     is        not
clear from the transcript but I believe this related to                                         1986).
At     the foot of page 41 however at H the words make                                clear           the
application              that        if the Club object too           strongly        about           any
police requirement the match can always be taken away from                                            the
Club.         At        page 42 this witness is asked to                 draw        conclusions
concerning              the desirability of the officers inside the                             ground
being       warned         about outside gates being opened and                       5     minutes
being a reasonable amount of time to ensure that such                                     messages
■were relayed.


At     page        43     there is reference to the video and                    at        247        the
ejection           of     somebody which led to an unfortunate                       rush        which
corresponded              in    time     almost precisely with            a    Mr.        Marshall
requesting that the gates be opened.                      There is discussion about
■whether the ejection was in accordance with standing orders                                           or
not.        The         ejection is further considered at                page         44.        What
happened           is     apparently described at 44D when                    apparently              the
police        attempted          to push one man out of C Gate                  and        in     fact
scores        if        not hundreds of people pushed in.                Mr.      Glasgow              at
page 44G establishes that it is in fact the police officers who
do     the        directing          to the terraces and Mr.              Mole     agreed          that
spectators              pay     very little regard to stewards who                      even       have
difficulty to get spectators to fit in the stands.                                  There is           a
discussion              at page 45 as to this officer's attitude as to                              the
manner in which the spectators filled the terraces.                                     45C        "once
that if full they ease out to the sides".                             The witness accepted
that     it       was unreasonable to expect                  any     Sheffield          Wednesday
steward to be on the terrace where the Liverpool fans were.


At page 46 Mr. Glasgow endeavours to establish by way of photo­
graphs with the witness that in 1988 the terrace filled to                                          the
point        of     capacity              and    the police   closed       the     tunnel.            My
impression is that Mr. Mole did not entirely concede this.                                            At
page     47E the witness agreed that it was a good idea                                  that       the
Club should be given the operational order for a match but                                          the
■witness          was     not aware that the Club had not                   been        given       the
operational order in 1989 for the first time.                              At page 48B              Mr.
Glasgow put to Mr. Mole that it was an alarming fact alone that
he     was        hearing           for     the first time     today       that     his        normal
experience              that        a terrace filled, maintained             its        level       and
spread        out did not happen in 1988 because somebody,                               including
the witness's officers had to close the tunnel-without Mr. Mole
even     knowing              that had been necessary.              The   witness         did       not
accept this and maintained that it had not occured but accepted
that if in 1988 what Mr. Glasgow suggested had happened had                                           in
fact happened it made nonsense of the suggestion that the                                          pens
filled        themselves and found their level                      without        supervision.
This at page 48D.                   At page 49 it is established that a copy                          of
the S.A. arrangements for the game appearing in the terms of                                           a
blue     leaflet              are     not passed to the police             and     the    witness
agreed        that        any        information that is        available          to     them        is
useful.           At page 49G there is reference to pre-match entertain­
ment     and Super Skills Competition on the field.                                The        officer
considered pre-match entertainment important.                               This at page 49H
and     at        page 50D in response to a question by the                         Judge,          Mr.
Glasgow           said that entertainment was programmed and                            advertised
but     unfortunately                 not       held.   At the bottom of          page        50    and
continuing onto the top of page 51 the question of the delay of
kick-off     on   one   previous occasion known to   the   witness   is
discussed.
Contd... Volume 3
Evidence of Mr. Mole
at page 51 of DAC bundle of transcript
Wednesday 24th May 1989 morning session




Mr.    B.L.      Mole cross-examined by Mr. King.          The     reasons      for
postponing or not postponing a kick-off were discussed as being
purely     a     policy decision for the police to make at              the    time
dependant upon all the circumstances.


At page 52 the witness was cross-examined by Mr. King                     concern­
ing    the capacity of the ground.          At page 52G Mr.        King       having
taken the witness through the hour of the possible entrance                       of
spectators       he     challenged    the witness   that     1,000      per     hour
requires       good conditions.       To this the witness answered             "well
that is the advice given by the Club sir and I respond to                       it".
At     page 53C this witness says that he did not know the                    advice
on the ticket as to the time to arrive.                He had never looked at
a     ticket     beforea game.       The witness did      not     consider       the
advice to arrive 15 minutes before was helpful at all.                     Through
page     53 arrival time and pass through into the ground time                    is
further discussed.          The contingency plan for late kick-off page
53H     being described as delay would be considered to give                    them
time     to     enter    the stadium if dissorder was        to    be     avoided.
Continuing over the page 54A.             At page 54B reference is made to
the     green     code in paragraph 46 concerning          contingency         plans
should        available entrances prove insufficient to            stop       unduly
large     crowds gathering outside.          Mr. Mole said that that is            a
direction        to the Club, the witness was not aware of              the     Club
having        such contingency plans but the Club has to satisfy                 the
F.A. that they can stage it.             At page 55 the witness is            cross-
examined on the question of contingency plans and the                     arrange­
ments made to help filter the crowd through the turnstiles.                       At
56F the witness appears to confirm that neither the police                       nor
the     stewards have any function in filling the terraces                    except
to observe it if there is danger of public dissorder.                            At     page
57 the witness is questioned as to what the supporter witnesses
when        he is going to enter the tunnel and when he                    has     entered
the    tunnel and thereafter.             At page 58B the       witness          explains
how a spectator knows whether a pen is full as follows:


      "If     people come to the tunnel end and can't achieve a                         move
       to the right then clearly the pen must be full."


And     at       58C they get into pen number 2 by going               back        to    the
tunnel.           Page 58 continues with a proper routine to pen 2                       and
the     lack       of sign posts.        At page 59 there      is     discussed          the
police responsibility for the filling of the pens.


At     page        6OB the witness says that faced with the                 middle       two
pens        being very crowded and the two wedges in the corner                         very
likely        populated he would possibly hve closed the tunnel                         with
his     serial offices and may then direct to the wings.                         Page     60
continues          with     the forceability of the central            pens        filling
first        and     the    planning      stage     establishes       that       only     by
observation           could the knowledge of how full the              central          pens
were        be established there is no precise method other                      than     by
observation.               This witness relied upon police box              observation
and     the police box should react to any                  developing        situation.
At page 60G the witness states that he considers the police box
to     be     in a better position than someone on               the       terraces       to
assess whether or not the central pens were becoming                             overfull.
At page 62 the area between 4 and 6 is considered a possibility
of     police        officers being stationed there.            The        evidence      was
that police officers have access toit as necessary.                          At page 63
there        is discussed contingency planning as opposed to                       written
contingency           planning     and    the     options    open     to     the      police
command.             Reference is made at page 64E to document 12                       para­
graph        152     "pitch perimeter gates should remain                  unlocked      and
manned           at all times the public have access to the ground"                       and
then        to     the contrary on page 65B an          operational          order       "the
gates must remain bolted at all times".                     The operational             order
referred          to as 1989.           There was a dispute about the gates                      not
having       bolts          but       spring    loaded    catches.           Paragraph           66F
reference          is       made by the Judge to Serial 1              Appendix           B     just
after       the     document which had been read the words "no                            one     is
-to   be     allowed access to the track from the                      terraces           without
consent       of        a    senior       officer      except     to     receive          medical
attention".              At page 67B the witness, Mole, said that                         in     the
circumstances               under      consideration      he     would        expect          police
officers          to take the initiative without reference to a                               senior
officer.           The       witness      was    cross-examined          by    Mr.        Jackson
commencing          on page 67.           Disagreement between the Club and                      the
police       is      here discussed in            particular       about        payment          for
officers.            At        page     69 reference is made       back        to       the      1981
incident.            Mr.         Jackson's cross-examination            of this           witness
appears       to play largely to an emotional gallarythrough                                   pages
69, 70, 71 largely relating to the spectactors "having to                                       peck
themselves"              and      later that the penning was           directed           towards
crowd control and not towards crowd safety.


At    the         foot      of    page 72 Jackson        turns    to     Tab        8    Subject:
Education of Club Stewards.                     This was a south Yorkshire                    police
document and at 73C it stressed that the admission and                                        packing
of     spectators at bigger games on the terracing is primarily                                   n    a
steward function and not a police one.                         Counsel claimed at                 73D
to     be     merely pointing out that it was quite                      clear          that      the
packing of terraces was a problem wellknown to the                                  authorities
and     the        witness agreed with this.              At 73F       Counsel           suggested
that        the     problem           had been passed     fairly       and     squarely           and
properly           onto the Club.           The witness did not appear to                      accept
this and said that he was asked how he would deploy officers if
he     had        perceived a problem which suggested                   there           was     over­
crowding in the pen and he had reacted to that answer.



The inquiry adjourned for lunch at this point.
Contd ... Volume 3
Evidence of Mr. Mole
of DAC bundle of transcript
Wednesday 24th May 1989 afternoon session




Mr.    B.L.     Mole was recalled and the cross-examination                          by     Mr.
Jackson continued.


The    witness was cross-examined on the choice                     of        Hillsborough
and     the fact that Liverpool fans were allocated                       less       tickets
based     on     average          gates   as   between   Nottingham           Forest        and
Liverpool.           The cross-examination commenced at page 74.


At    page      75     the desparity between the           number        of     turnstiles
serving        Nottingham          Forest supporters and the         number           serving
Liverpool        supporters was           covered    and     also             the flow        of
spectators.             At page 76 the flow rate through turnstiles                           is
considered           and     at page 77E there is reference to                 an     implied
strategy        of     delayed arrival shortly before kick-off                       to     stop
crowd     violence.          At the foot of page 77 Mr. Jackson starts                        to
cross-examine           on     the deployment of officers and             the         use     of
police        forces.        At     the foot of page 79      Jackson           deals       with
alcohol-free            zone      which causes people to stop             somedistance
away and consume drink there and probably arrive late.                                At page
81B Jackson put to the witness that it was reasonable to assume
that     if     Gate        B had been opened the fans        would           have        poured
through to the less full sections on the pens 5, 6 and 7.                                   This
officer        did not know whether consideration had been                          given     to
that.


The     witness,           Mole, was examined by Mr. Muller              commencing           on
page     81 about the absence of police officers on                       the        terraces
and     then at pages 82 and 83 questioned the witness                          concerning
the     fullness of pens and the criteria which might                          be     applied
tothe     fullness of pens when related to the evacuation of                                pens
in     an        emergency.       The response of the witness       basically              was
that        he would observe and if he considered a pen                  to     becoming
over full he would divert people to other pens.                     You do this by
use of his forces and his knowledge of the ground.                        At page           84
the witness agreed that the police had agreed to the                           placement
of     radial barriers on the west terrace and further                        that     "the
new     gates           at    the rear of the terrace also    be     under           police
control".              This statement related to the meeting 11th September
1981 however.                That meeting having been held in the climate                   of
the consideration of hooliganism and segregation.                        At page           85G
this witnesses understanding of what the recognised exits                              were
in     emergency             terms was through the tunnels    and        through           the
gates on the front.                It would depend upon the problem.             If        the
problem           was on the pitch he would send them back               through           the
tunnel.            At page 86D the witness said that if the               tunnel           was
blocked           he    would send the supporters towards' the                pitch        and
accepted Counsel's suggestion that this might produce crushing.
At     page        86H the witness said that the serial sergeant                     has     a
copy        of     the standing order and briefs his officers                  based        on
that standing order.               At page 87E this witness effectively says
that standing orders are the serjeant's bible and the                           officers
under        the        serjeant should not act upon their         own        initiative
since        it        could well be that they were not aware            of     all        the
facts.           In a crushing situation the serjeant should receive                        an
instruction by radio and the commanding officer would give that
instruction.                 On page 89E there is a document at item             4,        the
briefing           for the F.A. Cup Semi-final which refers to                  "however
as     the        ground filled up the usual packing         problems           occured,
there was space in the centre of the enclosure but fans refused
to move over and fill it."                The witness agreed that it             sounded
the same type of situation but he said that he wasn't there.


The     witness, Mole, was cross-examined by Mr. Maxwell                        at     page
90.         This        Counsel initially dealt with Phase 1 prior               to        the
match and the directives related to policing at turnstiles A
G     and        the deployment of police in respect of            that.         Through
page        91     and 92 he questioned the witness in relation                  to        the
operational order for Liverpool against Sheffield Wednesday                              on
the    14th     January.          At page 92F it is established            that       there
vere apparently 376 stewards available and Counsel then read                              a
directive related to stewards duties.


The    witness. Mole, was cross-examined by Mr. Dicen                       commencing
at    page 93.        The witness was questioned in the main as to                      the
experience of his Authority in policing semi-finals and it                              was
accepted that Hillsborough has staged eight during the past                              15
years.         It    was        established        that   the   Authority       had    vast
experience in the policing of semi-finals and by and large                              the
policing had been successful.


This     witness          had     no     direct      dealings    with     the    Football
Association           in 1989 as in 1988 he met personally with them                     at
Sheffield           Wednesday.          In 1989 he dealt with that         through      Mr.
Mackrell.           This at page 94F.


The    point         of    this        Counsel's    questioning    this     witness      is
demonstrated at page 95F which relating to the blue publication
put out by the F.A.                the witness says: "I think my            recollection
is     it merely asked             the Club to provide adequate policing                and
the normal arrangements".


The witness was cross-examined by Mr. Kallipetis commencing                              at
page     95.        The witness was referred to the Club's                 bundle      page
28, the black folder between a letter of 11th February 1987 and
29th     August           1986.        The witness said that      the     document      was
published           in a programme at the ground at his request to                     show
community policing in the area together with a map and a photo­
graph     of the officers.                There is reference to details           of    the
television monitoring system and said the control did not                              have
all     the views that             the Club room has because the Club room               is
particularly              concerned       about its turnstile flows and          that    is
monitoring turnstile flows.                   The police however have got a view
of all the turnstiles.                   This at page 96D.
The    witness, Mole, was cross-examined by Mr. Woodwood at                                  page
96.      The witness was taken through the green guide at page                                 20
under section 5 relating to "Ingress" and paragraph 46 relating
-to    situations where available entrances prove insufficient                                 to
stop     unduly large crowds from gathering outside and                             reference
is     made       in     that     paragraph     to    the      inclusion       of     opening
additional             entrances.      This     at      page      96G.      This          cross-
examination             largely     went    to the    intentions- of           the        police
-towards      planning and a non-oppresive attitude from the                              police
towards       a        happy family day out at a sporting event                     and      this
vitness against described his approach to this and the                                deploy­
ment     of his men and how he intended to keep order                          in     getting
people        to       the ground and       into the ground.          The      checking        of
tickets       was gone into, the question of drunks was                        gone        into,
the     questioning of stewarding was touched upon, the                             excellent
relationship             with     Mr. Locke was touched upon             and    television
monitors was touched upon.


At     page         101H the witness was asked about the control                        of     the
gate     in        the barrier which ran from the perimeter fence to                          the
ball     at        the     bottom of the west stand            and   was       referred         to
document           under     Tab 11.       The witness said that the              keys       were
possessed           by the police at the ground and once the gates                           were
opened        they       were secured       open.    It was not      the       practice         to
stand a police officer there.


The     witness          was asked again to give            evidence       about        delayed
kick-off            and     effectively the witness          repeated       his      previous
evidence            in this respect. At page 104 the officer                      was        asked
about the numbers of police in the south Yorkshire division                                     in
April 1989.              The total compliment being approximately 2,900 and
was     questioned           about the      area of their       responsibilities               and
other      events          which    were    having to    be     handled.The          final
conclusion             concerning policing this match was that 51% of                          the
 force was engaged upon this event.                   That is 1,122 men.                This at
page 105A.
This   witness was re-examined by Mr. Colins commencing at     page
105    and   his re-examination was completed at page   112.   Many
aspects of his evidence attached upon of course but in my      view
there is little if anything worthy of having specific attention
drawn to it.
Volume 3 - Page 113 - DAC Bundle of Transcripts
Wednesday 24th May 1989 - Afternoon session
David Godfrey Duckinfield called bv Mr. Colins



Mr.     Duckinfield           is     Chief     Superintendant        in     charge           of     F
Division.


Pages        113,     114 and 115 deal with this witness's                      CV     and        his
experience in policing football matches and other large                                     public
gatherings.


At page 115D this witness says that prior to his appointment as
Chief        Superintendant in charge of F Division his                         last        direct
contact       with      Hillsborough in terms of any                policing           was        ten
years ago.           At page 115H the witness says he learned on                            Monday
20th March 1989 that responsibility for Hillsborough would land
on     his plate shortly after he had taken over.                          At        page     116A
and C the witness refers to having sat in at the meeting called
by     Mr.    Mole      on     the     22 nd   March     1989     which    was         the        day
immediately           prior     to his promotion and therefore                   his        taking
over     at which time the provisional arrangements were made                                     and
he     arranged        a further meeting for the 29th March                      with        Chief
Inspector           Beale     and Inspector Fuel when he went                   through           the
operation order page by page and having been satisfied with the
arrangements           and    the     advice he        accepted     that        they        should
proceed along the lines of the operational order.                               This at page
116C, D, and E.             At 116E he had not been to the ground                       himself
by     then     but police at the ground on               possibly         the        following
Saturday.           At page 117D and E he says he did not look from                               the
turnstiles           and see the lack of signs but he said he                         knew        the
location        and the area and he knew that there were signs                               there
although        he     did not appreciate the signs might give                         rise        to
possible problems at that time.
Page 117F and G he says that on the 1st and 2nd April the                                               date
of     the Millwall match he was effectively divisional                                   commander
and     in overall command but the running of the match in                                      charge
of     the        Superintendant              and     formiliarised           himself     with           the
situation.               A     relatively           small    number      of     supporters          were
coming from Millwall.


After discussing the layout of the pens, the central tunnel and
the     A-G turnstiles the witness accepted at page 119B that                                            the
only     obvious way into the terracing because there was no                                            sign
at     all to the left and no sign to the wall which existed                                        with
an     opening           in it was through the tunnel.                     He did       not     accept
that this situation presented him with a potential problem.                                               On
page     119 generally the witness expresses the                                assumption          that
the     Liverpool fans attending the ground would know where                                        they
wanted        to     get to in the Hillsborough ground and                          how        to        get
there.        At page 120B and C the witness says he did not need                                         to
askanyone because he knew that crowd                                  management       control and
the      filling             of      pens     is      not    a    police       responsibility,the
direction           of        fans      and         things       of     that     order        are        the
responsibility of the Club and not the                                police service.          On page
120          this            officer        is questionedfurther               about     police
responsibility                as opposed to the responsibilities of the                             Club
and     he says at page 12OH that if a problem develops he                                      leaves
it     to those responsible for that problem and he only steps                                            in
if it gets          out of hand and there is a likelihood of injury.                                      At
page     121        Mr.        Collins put to the witness                  that he       had            just
described           a recipe for disaster and the                       witness     appreciating
his     position             endeavours            to recover it and           accepts     that           he
should        have police officers in positions who can                             monitor              the
positions           and ocntinues on page 121 to deal with serial                                   1     in
front        of     Leppings Lane terracing and serial 13 looking                                   over
into     the west stand terrace and at,page 122 he                                says     although
there        is     no specific reference in the order he                          would        expect
those     officers                to monitor any over-crowding and                  report          that
back.    This at page 122C.                         Continuing at page 122 the                witness
accepts that there is nothing specific in the operational order
that serial 1 or 13 officers had the specific responsibility to
report on overcrowding in the pens.             The witness simply           relied
on his briefing notes in which             he     stressed      safety,       crowd
safety, evacuation procedures.


At     page     122G   this witness refers to      the   responsibility             to
Superintendant Greenwood, who is the ground commander, to                         whom
he had delegated responsibility for more specific briefing.                         At
page     123B    the   witness says Superintendant        Greenwood          had     a
particular       attitude    to the Leppings Lane end          of    the     ground
because he was there in 1981 and following discussion about any
specific instructions the witness might have given for the lack
of instructions on page 24 at page 125 at A he says that he was
not     aware    of what occured at the 1981 cup final              when     people
were     injured.      At page 125G this witness appears to rely                  very
much     upon the fact that recent semi-finals had worked                   alright
and     assumed therefore that it would work alright again.                       This
at page 125G.


On page 126 the witness is relying on the perception of                      serial
13 overlooking the west end to perceive problems that they                         did
not     perceive overcrowding in the pens and says that if                   serial
13     or the track serials had noticed or perceived                difficulties
in the pens they would advise the control room and the                      control
room would then take some positive action and at page 127A                         the
witness       says that he was relying upon Inspector White                 because
he     has experience to take such actions as necessary.                   This     at
page 127B.       At page 127 the witness deals with'the              operational
order     made on the 29th March and to various other meetings                      he
attended      with     Superintendant,   D Division      and    the        traffic,
British Transport Police, a press conference giving information
about     routes, asking people to arrive early and if you do                      not
have     a ticket do not come to the ground because you               will         not
get in.       The officer was not aware of the rubric on the tickets
about     being in your place 15 minutes before kick-off but                      took
the     view that this did not mean in the ground but actually                              at
their place.             This at page 128B.


Pages        130 and 131 are taken up by discussion as to which                           pre­
match        briefing         document   is      actually     before       the     inquiry.
Effectively the witness gave one briefing to his inspectors                                 on
the     Friday          and    a further briefing to         all     officers       on     the
Saturday.              I think the document produced at page 132B was                      the
malgamation             of the two briefings, the words not spoken on                      the
Saturday but spoken to the inspectors on the Friday having been
crossed out.


At     page       133C the witness says he did              not     anticipate          people
arriving without tickets.


Still probing the non-ticket situation the witness at 134C said
he     was       not     aware   that    there    was   trouble          with     Liverpool
supporters             in 1986 when non-ticket holders tried to                   get     into
the match.             At page 134 and 135 Mr. Greenwood tried to                   protect
the     witness concerning his knowledge and the knowledge of                              the
police concerning the non-ticket situations.                        At page 135E           the
witness          says     his inteligence reports gave no             indication         that
people       mightarrive           without tickets.     At        page     136D     counsel
makes        a    point with this witness that the                 inspectors       on     the
Friday           he briefed them "insure the safety of the public                        both
inside           and    outside the ground" but deleted             the    words         "both
inside           and    outside the ground" from the briefing he                  gave     to
everybody of the Saturday.


This     appeared          to me to be very much the sort             of    point        that
Counsel makes             but the witness failed to explain the reason                     for
it.      At page          137 the witness goes through details of                 what      he
briefed on relating to escape routes but immediately                              following
this at pages 138 and 139 it was apparent that,this witness was
largely           concerned       with   the     segregation         of         supporters.
When     considering           problem   areas and safety at              page     141     the
witness        continues to give evidence concerning his briefing                       to
everyone on the Saturday pre-match and at page 14ID it                          becomes
clear        that     Mr.    Murray would command the       control       room,        Mr.
Greewood        within       the    stadium, Mr. Marshall     outside          and     Mr.
Chapman to the Nottingham outside and said "any difficulties or
decisions within those areas will be taken by those officers or
to the sector superintendants."               In general terms this            witness
left the superintendants and officers below them to fill out as
far     as     detail was concerned.         At page 142 the       witness           deals
with     the        briefing which had commenced at 10           o'clock        on     the
Saturday       morning        as it was taken over by Mr. Murray               and     the
aspects        of the briefing dealt with by Mr. Murray.                  He     toured
the area after the briefing and returned to the ground at about
1.15.         He went to the police control box at about ten                   minutes
to     two.         He had a hurried meal at 1.30 and went           with        Super­
intendant           Murray to see the referee to discuss           the     referee's
responsibilities and the police service.               At page 142G there is
evidence       concerning the arrangements about stopping the                       match
if     it was necessary to do so.            The system was for one            of      the
linesmen to be informed of the need to stop the match and                             that
linesman       would        go and inform the referee.      At     page        143A     it
becomes       plain that that arrangement did not work and                  he        says
the     arrangement was that a police officer at the tunnel                      would
communicate          with the linesman nearest to the            players'        tunnel
who would then indicate to the referee.               Unfortunately that was
not     prompt       enough.       At this point the inquiry       was    adjourned
until 10 am the following morning.
Contd/.... Volume 3 - DAC Bundle of Transcripts
Thursday 25th May 1989 - Morning session
David Godfrey Duckinfield recalled bv Mr. Colins



Page     1.       As I understood the evidence towards the end                          of     the
previous           day the discussion related to stopping the                         match     if
it     was        necessary           to    do so and   my     understanding          had     been
stopping           the match once it had started.                 The evidence          on     day
one     of        the     morning          session,   Thursday    25th       May     1989,     the
witness       was         in        fact questioned upon        defying       the     kick-off.
This     witness           says        that at the planning       stage        delaying        the
start        of     the        game had been considered for             instance        in     the
event        of     fog        on    the penines or       a    major    accident        on     the
motorway          prevent large numbers of supporters arriving                          at     the
ground        on time and those circumstances would be considered                               as
possibly          delaying           the     start of the match.        At     page     IE     the
witness           says     that        no consideration had been               given    at     the
planning stage to delay the start of the match if there were                                     a
large number of late arrivals for no assertainable reason.                                      At
page 2 the witness, faced with a bundle of documents, said that
he     had seen them in the police station but had not                               looked     at
them     in the time between them arriving in the post at the                                  end
of March and the match on the 15th April.                          Page 2F.          Page 3 and
4     both go to establish that Duckinfield did not read the back­
ground material immediately prior to the match and relied                                     upon
the operational order of Mr. Mole.


Page     5    deals           with the question of            whether    Mr.        Jackson     as
Assistant Chief Constable operations and                                                       was
actually          on     duty or whether he was there as a                     guest    of the
directors or not and                   the witness said that he, Duckinfield                   did
not     expect           to         look to Mr. Jackson        in making       decisions        in
respect       of         the        policing of the groundbefore              the     disaster
occured.           At page 6 there is reference to Mr. Jackson being in
the    control           box        at 2 o'clock but only         to    the     extent       that
Duckinfield           and Jackson agreed that things were going okay                         so
far.      At     the     foot of page 6 those        dealt    with     the        regular
operators in the police control box were Serjeant Goddard,                                  the
radio     operator,           P.C. Ryan, the officer sitting to             his        right
dealing        with     telephone    and   tannoy     systems,       P.C.     Bishard,
standing        at the back of the control room operating                   the        video
cameras.         Mr.     Jackson left the control box          at     an     undefined
time not known by Duckinfield.              Page 7 deals with the             position
of     video cameras as does page 8.             At page 9 the witness                 looks
at     photograph number 48 and identifies the                various       positions
within     the police control room and what the various                      equipment
does     and in addition to the other officers                already       mentioned
says     that Mr. Murray usually sits or stands by the                      left           hand
window by the door.             At page 9H the witness says that there are
limitations           on some (cameras) but overall you can get                   a        very
good view indeed.             At page 10D the witness says that there                       was
no     pair of field glasses in the control box.                 At page 10F                the
witness        states     that approaching 2.30 things were                filling           up
comfortably (my words).             At page 11A to C there is a dispute as
to     the timing of a radio message from Superintendant                     Marshall
asking     that Leppings Lane be closed.             The log states 2.17                    but
the     witness        says    that the timing was     a mistake       and        it was
nearer     to     2.30.         At page 11H it      is established           that           the
request was not complied with immeidately.                   The witness did not
know     the     reason       for this failure.      Throughout       page            12     it
becomes apparent that the request for closure of Leppings                                  L^ne
was     for it to be closed to traffic but the witness refuses                               to
accept     that he is aware of any difficulties although he saw                               a
build     up of people in Leppings Lane although at 2.30                     he            says
that he was aware of a concentration in                the centre of          thewest
terracing       and gaps on the sides.        This     at page 12H.          Page            13
deals with the witness's instruction for a tannoy message to be
made     for fans to move forward and spready along the                     terraces.
That instruction being given to PC Ryan but the witness did not
hear the message made and although he could not hear very                              much
for     the noise in the police control box he assumed that if                               he
gave     the order which he did then he assumed that it                        had      been
carried        out.         At page 14C the witness thought            that       if    that
message was not put out there might be a build-up.                           He did      not
think a dangerous build-up.                Page 14 deals with the witness not
accepting        that there was a problem at that time for him to                         do
anything more than instruct a tannoy message to be given.                               Page
15 deals with the situation where although the witness did                               not
give any instructions to the officers behind the turnstiles who
could     not        observe the build up in the centre               pens    he       still
expected        those officers to be aware of the situation                       in    that
area and be aware of a build-up.                At page 15G in this situation
the     witness           says that it is possible that          a    personal         radio
message was given to aquaint them but he is not aware of                               that.
He did not give such an order for such a personal radio message
to be sent.           At page 16B the witness said that he expected                      the
supporters           to     be   able to respond to his      tannoy         message       by
moving        along through the gates that were open at the back                          of
the     terrace.            At   page 16 the officer is      taken       through         his
assessment           of     the position at 2.30 and       his       discussion         with
Superintendant Murray on the basis that there was half an                               hour
to go yet and they would get the Leppings Lane people in.


At     page     17        this witness sticks to his       assessment         that       the
ground        was half full at 2.30 and that the rest of                    the    people
outside could have been got in within half an hour.                          He had not
thought        of the figure as being 12,000 people and he relied                         on
the     fact     that he had not received any            information          from       his
sector commanders away from the ground to                  reassure him that             all
the people that were turning up had already turned up. He                                did
not ask the sector commanders away from the ground however.                               On
page     18    there         is further    consideration    of       this     witness's
appreciatation             of    whether   there was a     problem       or not          and
accepted       that there was a crowd spilling onto the                     roadway       in
Leppings       Lane        necessitating the closure of Leppings               Lane       at
2.30    although it appears the message did not arrive to                          ensure
this    happened and at page 18H the witness admitted that                             there
was     a     build up of people at the Leppings                Lane     entrances                by
2.30.         At page 19 it is established that this officer did                                 not
enquire        of        his     sector officers away from the         ground              as     to
whether        there           were further people to come,       he     assumed                that
there        was     a     possibility of others coming          and     he       made           the
assessment           that        they    could all get in by 3     o'clock             and        he
expected           police        officers    to report in if     there       were           large
numbers        of        people congregating and large          numbers          of        people
walking        towards the ground if that was the                situation             without
him     asking for that specific information.                   He did not             receive
that information.                 Page 20.    He would expect to have to ask for
this        information           or     brief   his officers    to give          him           that
information           prior to the event.          At page 20 he confirmed                      that
he     put at page 5 in his statement that at about 2.30 he                                 asked
Superintendant              Murray       to clarify with him    the      circumstances
under        which he would consider delaying kick-off but                        this           was
not because he was then considering the possibility of delaying
kick-off and it is apparent from page 21 that                     this officer                   had
in     mind the previously mentioned accident on the                        motorway              of
fog     on the penines as being a reason for delaying kick-off                                    as
opposed as stated in his statement "as opposed to those who had
been     brought          to     the area within a reasonable          time           but        had
chosen        not to enter the ground as soon as possible".                           Page        22
considers           the crowd problems that might occur due                  to        delayed
kick-off.           At page 23C the witness says that if               Superintendant
Murray had thought that the supporters would not have been                                       got
into     the        ground        by    3 o'clock then he   would have            seriously
considered delaying the kick-off.                   At page 23H the witness said
to     the Judge that he would delay                kick-off if he       thought                that
not doing so would cause a danger to life and injury.                                 At     page
24F     to     H     the witness says that it was plain that                     he        had     a
difficulty           at    twenty to three which caused          him        to        consider
postponing kick-off but he was overtaken by events in that                                       the
radio        developed a fault and he was unable to communicate                             with
the     police officers in the operational area.                  At page              25        the
witness        is     unclear          as to whether he intended       to        delay           the
kick-off           and failed to do so because of the radio              failure         or
not but at pages 26 and 27 the witness goes away from the point
and     discusses numbers through turnstiles further                    green      guide
and     apparently          comes to the conclusion that he          can    get         the
people        in    the     ground    and then at page      28   says      that        this
conclusion was with hindsight and the advice of                      Superintendant
Murray.        This at page 28A and 28D the witness is asked                 whether
with     the       radio failure that he had mentioned whether                  it      was
possible to switch to another mode to which he says that he may
be     able    to switch to another mode but all he is aware                      of     is
that the ground channel for the radio, he had difficulty                               with
the main radio system.


The     witness         says     that extra horses were      deployed       from        the
Penestone Road end of the ground and that a reserve serial                              was
sent from the gymnasium to assist at the Leppings Lane end                              not
on     this    witness's instructions but of their own                volition           of
which he approved but this witness did give instructions for                              a
tannoy message to be relayed to the crowd outside the                       Leppings
Lane     end       to     ease   back and   not   push     forward      against         the
turnstiles.             At page 29 this witness cannot be specific as                    to
the stage at which he gave instructions for the tannoy                       message
but     assumes that it was given to PC Ryan but could not                        recall
what    was        actually said or how often.           Continuing on      page         29
there     is discussion of the radio problem and on page 30 a                           man
comes     to restore communications which he did.                It was      only         a
short break in communications but the officer cannot be sure of
the actual duration.

Thursday 25th May 1989 - Morning Session
David Godfrey Duckinfield called bv Mr. Colins



Page 30G the witness's appreciation of his problems at the time
the communications went out was as follows:-


       "The crowd was building up at the Leppings Lane end by                     the
        turnstiles and extra officers had been sent              but we had not
        been    informed verbally as to the true situation               that      is
        the mood of the crowd and what the difficulties were."


The     witness was not aware of problems on the west terraces                     at
this     stage.       The witness was shown album to           south     Yorkshire
police        album photograph DB29, photograph of pen 4 at 2.46                  and
from    that photograph the witness           said that he       considered        at
quarter to three if there is that sort of space in it there                        is
plenty of space.


At     page     32H   at 2.44 either    the    witness    or     Superintendant
Marshall        arranged    for tannoy messages from a          public     address
system        to be   made to the crowd       outside    the     turnstiles        to
releave pressure on the turnstiles.             At page 33 it is clear             to
the witness that he was not going to get all the crowd in by                        3
o'clock but he did not make a clear decision to postpone                       kick-
off because his mind was taken up with other things and at 2.47
he had a request from Superintendant Marshall to open the                        gate
but     the    witness would not accept that there was             a     situation
whereby       delaying     the   kick-off   would   assist       him    with      his
problem.        At page 33 the witness says he had two problems                   and
delaying the kick-off is one thing.             Communicating that to             the
crowd     outside and getting them to agree with your                  request     is
another       and the situation was that already I             understand        that
officers were telling people that the kick-off had been delayed
and     they were not responding to requests to ease back and                         not
responding        to tannoy messages.          At page 35 the witness is              not
thinking of delaying kick-off as part of the resolution of                            his
problem        outside the turnstiles and is            apparently      considering
the more immediate effect of opening the gate which he                            thought
would     defeat           the objective of his operation order             and     allow
drunken fans in, people with drink in, and people with missiles
in and also people without tickets to get access.


At page 36H the witness recalls receiving a radio message                            from
Superintendant             Marshall requesting to be allowed to              open     the
gate and immediately looking at the turnstile monitor the                            gate
appeared        to open.           It subsequently proved that his          perception
was     incorrect           but whilst he was considering the          request        his
thinking        was        "the    gates burst open anyway, why        am     I     being
asked".         The gate was in fact opened at that moment                   to     eject
someone.         The        gate    was closed and the officer        had     made     no
decision.        At page 38 the officer is aware that by opening                      the
gate problems might be transferred from outside to the                            inside.
He     had a further request from Superintendant Marshall for                         the
gate     to     be opened with advice that if they            were      not        people
would     be     injured.          At page 39 the witness     eventually           agrees
that     he     had        five minutes to think      about   opening        the     gate
although it didn't seem that long.                  At page 40 the witness goes
back     to his impressions when the gate was opened in the                         first
instance.         At page 41 the witness gives his thought                   processes
in relation to his consideration of opening the gate.                         After     a
long diatribe on page 41 as to his thought processes he came to
the     conclusion           that he has no option but to open          the        gates.
On page 42 Superintendant Murray made another radio request                            on
talk through where everybody could hear for permission to                            open
the     gate.         At     page 43 with     the   witness   still     considering
whether        to open the gate at 43B the witness knew that when                      he
decided        the gates should be opened the Club did not know                      that
that decision had been made and were unaware of what was                            going
to     happen.        At page 43D it becomes apparent from             the        witness
that    Superintendant              Marshall      was givenpermission from the
control         room for the gates to             be opened.The witness did not
give any        instructions to those             inside theground butcould not
anticipate their actions.                 The witness agreed that those enter­
ing    the          ground with the time          approaching      kick-offthat the
easiest       route was that central tunnel but this                officers         mind
was     filled       with other events that were taking place                 and        his
thoughts       did not go to the central tunnel.               This at page          44A.
At page 44B the Judge suggested that that was the time that the
witness       might have given some instructions to-the officers                          on
the concourse to try to direct the flow and the witness said he
might        have done but he did not.           He was busy    watching        events
and     it     did not cross his mind to issue an              instruction.               No
further        discussion on page 44 on the basis that               this      witness
observed        but      gave no specific instructions.          On page       45        the
witness        gives evidence that almost immediately he               opened            the
gate and received a message about A gate probably giving way in
any event.          On page 45 there is some confusion about this.                        At
page     46     the witness clarifies in response to the               Judge         that
when     he gave the order to open the gate he thought Gate                         A,     B
and     C were going to be opened and was surprised to                    receive          a
message        about the possibility about Gate A being                burst        open.
The witness never did discovery whether Gate B had been opened.


At page 47 the witness gives evidence that he gave instructions
that        every     available officer should attend in            two       different
locations,          the    north stand and the        perimeter     track.          These
instructions were given largely in relation to the consequences
as     he     thought about the opening of Gate A.              He did        not    take
any     action        in    relation      to the opening of     Gate      C    and       the
terraces.           At     page     47F    the   witness   says,     regarding           the
terraces,           that he thought they would be pushing and he                    wanted
to     observe the situation across the terrace.                   At page 48B           the
witness refers to the suggestion over the radio almost at kick-
off     time for the kick-off to be delayed the                 witness        believes
from        a PC Buxton.          At page 50C the witness says that once                 the
teams     ran       out     on to the pitch he considered        the      option          of
delaying        the       kick-off   had been removed.      At     the     time        the
witness was considering this and came to that conclusion he was
unable to say whether the team had come out for their pre-match
warm-up       after which they apparently returned to               the        dressing
rooms     or whether they were out on the pitch              before        kick-off.
It appears probable that at that moment in time the teams                             were
coming       out for their warm-ups but the officer had                  still        made
the mental decision that he had lost the option.


At    page 52 it is put repeatedly to the witness that he                           should
hve been aware of the possibility of the central pens                          becoming
over-full          but     he refused to accept the general         proposal              and
responded with broad generalities.


At     page     52H he saw either Gate 3 or 4 being opened                 and        some
people coming out onto the perimeter track which surprised                                him
and     he    wanted to know why it had been opened because                        such     a
gate     should          only be opened on the instruction from                a    senior
officer       according to the Order.         At page 53E the witness                 sees
increased traffic of people coming out of those pens and people
beginning          to     climb   over the sides and      front.         The       witness
thought       that it was a pitch invasion.            The witness         looked          at
photographs             EV1714    and DB1717 at page 54     of     the     transcript
showing       people        going over the perimeter fence          and        also       the
radial fences both within a minute or two of 3 o'clock but                                the
officer did not accept that people going over the radial fences
into other pens was an unusual phenomenon.                  At page 54H he says
he     knew that he had taken those steps at all to block off                             the
tunnel        or    to stop people coming through          the     central          tunnel
followed           by page 56A he could see that what had developed                       was
people        were trying to get out of the central pens but                        looking
at the terrace it did not give him an indication as to why                                the
gate     should be opened.            The terrace appeared to be           in       order.
He     said he was not receiving any information to                  the           contrary
and     he did not know that there were already people                     dead       when
"that    barrier had collapsed".            (Reference to the         barrier        was
made    by     Mr. Collins.         I am unaware of it    being       referred        to
previously in this witness's evidence).


He did not give any instructions.              He thought that the position
on     the terrace was stable.           At page 58B he was not aware            that
the     tunnel was filling with spectators he was looking                  at        the
gate.        This officer's attitude is amazing - at page 58C he says
if     the     terracing was overcrowded as you say           then      reasonable
people        going down that tunnel would surely turn round               and         go
back.         At page 58H it appears that the only thing the               witness
did     was     to pass a radio message via the           controllers       in        the
control room to ask the PC on the track what was happening.                            He
got no response and he assumed this to be because of the                         noise
factor        and the atmosphere causing difficulties.            At     page         59C
the witness states what he did as follows:-


      "Because       we     were   getting no response and     the       fans    were
       moving        down    the perimeter track walking      towards          Gate     1
       where     there       was space the obvious situation would              be     to
       open     Gate number 1 and to invite the fans to go                in     there
       where     there was more room and the lady police                officer        at
       Gate 1 did not seem to be appreciating the situation.                         Now,
       she     was     not    in possession of a radio and        I     sent     Chief
       Inspector          McRobbie (he was in plain clothes) who was                 with
       me,     onto       the perimeter track, but in addition,           when        the
       gate was opened I asked for Superintendant Greenwood to                         be
       located        who was in charge of the perimeter track to go                   to
       the     scene and determine exactly what was taking place                      and
       advise me of it."


At page 59 the officer is shown photographs composite to                         south
Yorks. PR1/8A showing more and more people coming out onto                            the
track but not onto the pitch.              At page 60C the game is             stopped
not     apparently           due   to an order given by    this       witness.         He
says:-
     "I remember Superintendant Greenwood going to that                              location
      and     the fans coming onto the pitch ... I am sorry not                              the
      pitch     onto the track and then spilling over and                       the         next
      thing I recall is he was standing on the advertising                                     ,
      looking       into     the   ground and then      waving           his     arms        and
      crossing          them, and someone said in the control box, and                         I
      cannot       remember who, "he wants the game stopped"                         and     the
      radio     operator       gave      an instruction for the               game     to     be
      stopped       and that message was passed on the radio                         but     did
      not     seem to be acted upon, again possibly because                           of     the
      noise."


The method of stopping the game is then discussed.                             The        system
for stopping the game did not work and Superintendant Greenwood
ran    onto        the pitch and spoke to the referee who                     stopped        the
match.        At     page    61,    62 and 63 there         is    discussion           as     to
precisely          when the witness appreciated that he had                     a     serious
situation          on his hands and although he accepted that he                           could
see from the photographs he was shown that there was a                                serious
situation the actual timing of his appreciation does not appear
to     be    established.          At    page    64B   he        says    that        he     gave
instructions            to   Superintendant Greenwood            and     Superintendant
Murray to go down to the location and access the situation                                   but
did not at that stage give any instruction to anyone to do any­
thing       apart from that.            At 64D concerning any action taken                    by
him to aleviate crushing in those pens he says the officers                                   at
that        location were removing people from those'pens and in                             his
view he had given the authority to the Superintendants to go to
the ground and deal with the situation.                     At page 64E and F                the
witness says that he delegated responsibility to go down to the
location to assess the situation and deal with it.                             He did        not
send anybody to go round to the back of the pens to get                                   people
out through the tunnel.                 His attention was drawn solely to                    the
situation          at    the fence.       He did not receive            any    information
from anybody to suggest that he should send serials to the back
of the pens to releave anybody.            Concerning this officers total
inactivity and direction he says at 65C "I am not aware that                         I
sent anybody.          There were other people in the control room                 who
may have taken the responsibility and when the difficulty arose
I know that some serials went into that tunnel area later.


Page     65    the officers continued inactivities            discussed          until
page     65H    when Chief Superintendant Nesbitt arrived                 and     took
charge        on the pitch and at page 66B the witness says                that     as
soon as he realised the severity of the situation he asked                         for
assistance and a fleet of ambulances and implemented the                         Major
Incident Plan.          At page 67D the witness refuses to accept                 that
Assistant        Chief Constable of Operations Mr.Jackson                took     over
his command at this stage.           Mr. Jackson went onto the pitch and
liaised         with      Superintendant    Murray     and        Greenwood        and
Duckinfield          resumed responsibility still in the control                 room.
At page 68 there is muddled discussion, or muddled answers from
the    witness,        concerning   tannoy messages.         He    did     not     say
specifically           towards   the tunnel, he said, "Ease         back".         The
witness knew nothing about a tannoy message for people to clear
off the pitch.           Page 69 the witness is reminded from his state­
ment that he did give instructions for a broadcast to clear the
pitch, fans were hampering rescue and he wanted people to                         move
away     so that he could see who required attention.                    They     were
supposed        to     move to the sides, the north stand side              and    the
south        stand side.     At page 70 the officer was not              aware    that
there     was trouble from the Nottingham Forest end because                      they
saw     Liverpool fans coming on the pitch.            This officer was             too
engrossed in the events that were taking place at the other end
of     the     ground     at the Liverpool end.      He was       not     told    that
there        were problems with Nottingham Forest end.              At     page     70E
the     witness        says in response to a suggestion that              he     should
have appealed for calm explaining what was happening - "I                          took
the     view sir that on that occasion we said nothing.                    We     would
use     the     tannoy to try and clear the pitch and              we     would     say
nothing to the crowd because it might cause a reaction."                          Pages
70 and 71 deals with the postponement of the game.             Mr.      Clough
and Mr. Dalglish came to the control box and offered to pass                   a
message       to    the Liverpool fans appealing    for     assistance       and
calm.      The offer was accepted.        The officer was firm       that     he
made    the        correct decision in not telling the crowd      what       had
happened        for    over 40 minutes.   At page 71H the     witness       made
the     announcement        shortly after 4 pm and the reaction       of     the
crowd was excellent but the witness could not say exactly                   what
the     crowd       did.   At page 72 the Judge   adjourned    the    morning
hearing until ten past two.

Mr.     Duckinfield was cross-examined by Mr. Hytner who                                     appeared
for     the bereaved and injured.                    The witness refused                to    accept
that he had made any errors on the day in question based                                       on the
information          available to him.               He also considers that none                      of
the police officers under his command made any wrong decisions.
At page 74F the witness says that other agencies were                                        involved
in controlling the crowd - the Club.


Mr.     Hytner took this witness towards the Green Guide but                                        said
at page 76F "I didn't have discussions with Sheffield Wednesday
but     as     far        as     I   am concerned         from      the    Green        Guide        the
responsibility                 for   pens and packing of pens               rests        with        the
Club."         He did not know what arrangements had been                               made        with
the     Club       because he said any such arrangements were                                made     by
Chief Superintendant Mole prior to his arrival and at page                                           77A
he     did not take it upon himself to find out what it                                  was.         On
page      77     the       layout of the ground is                discussed        and        at     77G
questioned           as        to how Sheffield Wednesday stewards                      and        other
servants of the Club were going to spread the crowd through the
pens      into the wings if there was overcrowding in                              the        central
pens.        He answered "I presumed that they would be in the                                     crowd
and     advising           people      to move along."             Stewards    were           at     the
entrance wearing distinctive bibs or tabbards.                                At page 78C the
officer        assumed           that stewards would take                 action        around       the
tunnel.          At the far end in the concourse.                         At 78D the          witness
layed        the     blame and responsibility at the door                          of     Sheffield
Wednesday Club for lack of stewards at the front of the                                        tunnel
and/or         anywhere          on the terrace.           "It is my view           they       should
provide them there".


At page 79 Mr. Hytner takes this witness outside the ground                                           to
the    turnstiles         at Leppings Lane.     Reference is        made        to     the
funneling       effect         towards the turnstiles and an        escape           valve
along     the river which Mr. Hytner suggested was blocked and                          at
79C the witness said that the road was not blocked.                        Reference
is    made    to     composite album 1        photograph     MWL15/6A       and        the
witness       says    that there was a safety barrier            there      but        the
escape       route was not blocked.          At page 80 there is          discussion
of     the approach to the turnstile.            At page 18 the question                of
ticket       touts       and the use of the police      horses       assisting           in
crowd control.           At page 82 a discussion of non-ticket              holders.
At     page 83 there is still discussion of the               organisation             and
the     alternative           organisation   which   might    have     been          along
Leppings Lane and on page 84F this witness discusses the                             foot­
ball     crowd       in the same terms as a cinema queue             and        says     "I
don't     see      why        football supporters should     have     a    different
approach and mentality to queuing than anybody else and I would
have     thought         as    they   arrived on Leppings     Lane        and     saw     a
situation        and a queue they would halt and form a               queue".            At
page 85 the witness describes the density of the crowd at                              2.30
and     2.40.        The centre pens 3 and 4 were not fully packed                      but
at page 85C he describes them as shoulder to shoulder and chest
to back.        The witness describes this situation as "There                       would
be room but there is packing."

Cross examination of Mr Hytner of D J Duckenfield


Page 86, Thursday 25 May 1989 - Afternoon session


Page 86 it           was discussed with the witness         as to whether at 2.45
and     2.50     pens numbered 3 & 4 were uncomfortably full but                     his
perception was that leading upto kick off the two pens were not
overcrowded           but were getting on to being nearly full.                  This at
page     86H.        Page 87 the witnesses perception of how full pens 3
&     4 were is further discussed and at page 87F he says that the
time was coming shortly when somebody would have to cut off the
inflow         into     those    pens      and   in   his   view   that    was       the
responsibility           of the club stewards but he did not know in the
control        room that at that stage there were any stewards at the
front     of the tunnel or not.              Page 88 Mr Hytner discusses           with
the     witness the question of opening the gate by the turnstiles
a     question        of whether supporters would have drink              with      them
and/or        missiles both of which he had in mind but he decided to
have     the     gate near the turnstiles opened because there was                     a
danger        that     the crowd outside could be killed but it did                  not
specifically           cross     his    mind that if the      gates   were        opened
incoming        fans     would     or might get onto the terrace            that     was
already nearly full.              This at page 88E &F.        At page 89 there is
discussed            the awareness of people inside         the ground at gate         C
was     going         to be opened 10 minutes before kick off and at                 8 9B
the     witness says that stewards in that locality would be aware
of      the      developing            situation.     The   witness       says      that
Superintendent           Murray        tried via his personal radio link            with
Sheffield        Wednesday Football Club to contact Mr Lock the Chief
Steward        but was unable to do so, this at 89D.               At page 90A the
witness relys on stewarding to direct fans away from the centre
pens     when        gate C opened because they, the stewards,               in     that
locality        would be aware of the developing situation.                                      At     page
91     Mr     Hytner takes the witness through his previous                                      evidence
concerning           the        decision          to     open the gate and               the     lack        of
consideration              to     the    affect of the terraces                     upon        the     gate
opening        he     did       not issue a direct instruction to                              close        the
tunnel but two alternatives by Mr Hytner at page 92 the witness
chose the statement:


             "I made a mistake but in fact other officers should have
             remedied that mistake by using th eir initative".


This        at page 92B.          At page 93 the witness gives evidence as to
his     expectation of the actions his officers around the                                            ground
might       have taken and also the things that the stewards                                          should
have         done         and    said        at        9 3E     that     it   was     the        stewards
responsibility, prime responsibility, to monitor what was going
on     from the top of the west stand and make a judgement on what
they saw by looking.


On     page 94 Mr Hytner put it to the witness that the answers he
had     given        to     Mr Collins demonstrated that he had                             made        only
unrealistic           assessments of how people can behave, the                                  witness
did     not accept this.                Page 95 this witness could not help with
regard to the believe of the police officer that there had been
the breaking down of a gate by the fans.


At     page     95 Mr Jackson commenced his cross examination                                      of       Mr
Duckenfield.           At page 95E in response to the question : Did the
man     think there was a great deal of similarity between                                            24,00 0
Liverpool           supporters          anxious to beat Notts. Forest again                                 and
the      people        killing          for        Bambi         at     the   local      cinema?            He
answered:           Queues       sir are queues.                 At pages 9 6 and 97             and        by
looking         at     various          photographs               the     discussion        on     queues
continues.            At     page       98        the         discussion      as    to    what         is     a
reasonable           time       to arrive at a Football match and he                             thought
2.3 0pm was late in some respects.
(there        is        an error in pagination at page 98 - there                    are     two
pages        numbered          98) At the second page 98 there is                discussion
relating to the filling up of pens 3 & 4 and the fact that this
officer           did not know of the near tragedy in 1981 as                     mentioned
in     page        99     in response to the suggestion that there                     was    no
mention           of monitoring and crushing in the order of the day the
witness           disagreed and said that he considered the word                        safety
was all in bracing and sufficient.


At     99C the witness restates that stewards are responsible                                for
monitoring               and        the   officer    is   questioned      on      emergency
evacuation              particularly in the event of fire.              On page 100 the
witness           said that he had never seen documents relating to                          the
positioning             of     an     ambulance     officer   and   the        granting       of
complimentary                tickets      in that respect.     The next document              is
referred to as being dated August 1988 and is partially read at
page        100F .        At page 101A Mr Jackson translates the import                       of
the     document             to be emergency care of 55,000 people                attending
would        be     better suited by an ambulance officer in                     the    north
stand        but        in case a Sheffield Wednesday player              gets         injured
they want the ambulance officer in the south stand.


A.t    page        101 the witness Duckenfield is cross examined                       by     Mr
Muller at page 101C the witness agrees that in the case of fire
in     the West stand the intention would not be to evacuate                                only
pen     3     as opposed to the whole terrace.                Further on that               page
the     witness is not aware of the detailed lay out of the ground
but     accept at page 101H that the opening and closing of                             gates
is not the responsibility of the stewards and the police accept
that        responsibility on the perimeter track.                  Questioned          about
further           gates      the     witness accepted at page          102B     that        gate
between        pen and pen were opened by a police officer and locked
back.         At     102G      Mr Muller put to the witness            that      a     police
officer           should       perform the duty of keeping gangways clear                     so
that     people           can get through gates.          The witness said that               he
considered           that to be a stewards responsibility.                    At page        103
there       is covered the responsibility of police for gates and at
103F        the     witness          accepts that it would be            difficult           for     a
police        officer          and     more difficult for a         steward        perhaps           a
Sheffield           Wednesday steward operating in a crowd of                          Liverpool
supporters.              At page 105C the witness said that he accpeted the
view        expressed          by Mr Muller that as far as the                 terraces            are
concerned           it is a matter for the fans to level themselves out.
At     page        106     reference is made to the green                 guide        and        this
officers           perception              of 5 people in one square metre and                     the
fact        that     they          would     not be chest to back         and shoulder              to
shoulder           this       at     106E.      At page 107 the         officer        is        shown
photograph           BR2/1          taken     at 3.04pm with peoply         lying           on     the
ground        and        people       trying to get out of the           pen      and        having
difficulty getting through the gate.                        The officer accepted that
it could have been a solution to cut some of the fence down but
this did not occur to the witnesses mind immediately.                                   Page 108
the     witness is questioned as to the fire brigade being                                   called
at     3.14pm        but       the officer could not recall              whether            cutting
equipment          was        specifically requested.          The officer said                  that
the     message was sent to Clay Wheels Lane the police                                transport
garage        for        cutting       equipment but he did not            know        that       the
equipment           on fire tenders could cut through very thick                            pieces
of     metal        and the sanctions could have been cut                      through.            At
page        109E through H the witness recalls a message coming                                  into
the     control box requesting cutting equipment for the                                Leppings
Lane end from somebody at the Leppings Lane end but he does not
know whether anybody reacted to that but if the reaction was to
ring the fire brigade that did not happen until 3.14pm.


At     page 110 the cross examination of Mr Duckenfield                                commences
by     Mr    Maxwell          the witness was asked by             Mr    Maxwell        whether
acepting that there were segregation of fans, sterile areas and
confinement              of    fans        within    particular     pens     the        witness
considered          it could be helpful if signs were put up to                             assist
spectators          going          across the concourse to indicate                where          the
terraces          were.       The witness considered permanent signs to be a
difficulty          because          of alterations in requirements but                     agreed
that        temporary          signs         could   have   been    useful        to     suit       a
P ^-^ticu 1ar        occasion.           At   page 111C   the   safety      certificate
rcquirGd           6 6 stewards and as to what these stewards were to                      do
the     witness           said    Mr Murray briefed them.       At     page     111       the
witness said once gate C was opened it was pointless for serial
14 to attempt to stop people coming in with drink and so on but
he     kept serial 14 in the area of the concourse at the back                             of
the turnstiles for overall policing.


At     page        112    Mr Dyson commenced his cross examination                   of    Mr
Duckenfield.               The witness recalled the attendance of Mr                  Kelly
and Mr Curtain of the FA in the police control box at 3.15pm or
thereabouts              together    with Mr Maxwell secretary         of     Sheffield
Wednesday club who wanted to know what had happened and what he
was     going to do and they were told he was going to abandon the
game but was not going to disiminate that information yet.                                the
witness           accepted       that he may have said that the          problem          had
been     created          by a gate being forced open by fans and                by       the
first        gate he meant gate C.             At page 112 the witness          accepted
that     he had not told Mr Kelly the truth at that stage that the
gate     had been opened as a result of his instruction.                        On     page
113     the witness says that at F he should not communicate fully
the     situation until possibly a senior officer of his knew                             the
situation.            This witness had no idea that as a result of                    what
he     said        to Mr Kelly two theories had been circulated                  to       the
press as to the cause of the disaster.                    The fans theory and the
police        theory.       The fans theory being that the gate was opened
by     the        police and the police theory that the fans had                     forced
the gate open.


At     page        114 the witness Duckenfield is cross examined                 by       Mr
Kallipetis.


Mr     Kallipetis          takes the witness Duckenfield          through       various
parts        of     his written statement and continues on page 115                       and
page     116        and    then     at    page 117G reference     is     made    to        an
enormous          amount of police officers on the pitch forming a line
across        the    pitch        driving     Liverpool fans    who    were     running
towards       the        Nottingham Forest end of the ground back                  towards
Leppings       Lane but the witness said that was on the command                         of
another       officer        Mr Nesbitt.           At page 119 the      officer     agrees
that     he was site commander and was with other officers calling
the    ambulances.           At page 120 there is a transcript of the call
received       at ambulance headquarters from South Yorkshire police
operations          room giving a very low grade message that they                      may
need        a few ambulances to carry the injured due to pushing                        and
shoving.        It goes on at page 121 that ambulances are not needed
at     the moment and then after a delay a request for a fleet                           of
ambulances          all      available           ambulances to Hillsbrough        and   the
understanding              that        one of    the gates has collapsed or broken.
The    witness           denied having           supplied an untrue message        to   his
officers        that        to        which     he gave to Mr Kelly.      At     page    122
witness Duckensfield is questioned about the manual but is lost
without        looking at it and the officer said that he did not use
the code word and Mr Kallipetis at page 123A says "it would not
have        helped but we were not aware of it either".                    The     witness
was     not aware of a South Yorkshire Police plan especially                            for
Hillsbrough              in the event of a major disaster, he had not                   seen
one and he had not enquired since.                       The witness accepts at page
123F        an overall control and co-ordination of the effort of all
services           involved in dealing with a major incident is a police
responsibility.                  At     page     124 the witness   is    taken     through
various        of the emergency services that were alerted but he did
not alert any of them and did not effectively cause any of them
to     be     alerted.            At     page 126 it appears that        the     club   had
refused complimentary tickets to some ambulance officers and a
private        arrangement was made between Inspectors and                       ambulance
officers           for     the        ambulance officers to be let        in     with    the
police        at Peniston Road end with the knowledge and the consent
of     the     club.        This at page 126B.           Page 127 there is        evidence
concerning           the     calling           of the ambulances and     denied     having
called        to     anyone to evacuate casualties to outside gate C                      at
Leppings Lan e .
At   page 128 there is discussion of the "police        review"    which
gives    a     lot of blurb about the close circuit cameras and      the
police       awareness   of   everything that is happening.   At    this
point    at page 13 0 the enquiry was adjourned until 10.00 am the
following morning

Mr     Kallipetis          further cross examined Mr Duckenfield                      who      was
questioned           further         about    the messages which            went      from     the
stadium         to       the    ambulance       service.        Lord        Justice      Taylor
questioned           M    Kallipetis about the number of amublances                          which
vere     at     the ground prior to the match and were told that                               one
ambulance        there         and    one ambulance on stand by.                And     it    was
explained        to       the Judge that the first ambulance on the                          scene
i.e.     the one already there, operated as a command post sending
messages back to ambulance base and receiving messages and this
is     normal practice for the first ambulance on site whose                                  duty
it is make an assessment of exactly what is required.


There is then discussion between the Judge and Mr Collins as to
the viewing of videotape in addition to the compilation tape.


There was further discussion with the Judge from Mr Collins who
was     endeavouring to limit the scope of the enquiry to evidence
relating        to he was suggesting possibly a cut off at                          something
like 4.00pm and Mr Hytner who was seeking a cut off ofevidence
relating        to       matters      up     to say    9.00pm          that     night. It was
decided to consider it over the weekend.


There     was further discussion with Judge by Mr Collins                              who was
seeking        that police officers had                copies          of      the video tapesso
that     the     witnesses could see as much of the material as                              they
can     before they give evidence and the request appears to                                 have
been     granted          at   about page 9.          The enquiry in          dealing        with
these     matters was effectively trying to use up some time while
it     awaited       the availability of some further video                        which      was
intended to be viewed.
At     page        10     prior to the video being       available,     Mr       Glasgow
commenced           his cross examination of Mr Duckenfield.                Mr Glasgow
opened        by        taking the witness back to what he had          said        about
crowd     management and the duties he considered rested with                          the
clubs     stewards.              At page 10D the witness says " I would               have
expected           that     as    the crowd came through the gates           that      the
stewards           in     the area would have assisted in direction of                 the
fans away from that tunnel".


Reference           is     made to the first opening of       gate C        at    2.47pm
which     was unintentional and the witness accepted that the whole
objective           of     the policing operation had been to          control         the
crowd     outside,           to allow the crowd to be filtered through                 the
turnstile           system at a rate the ground could safely consume and
the     witness           recognised that any breach of that system               either
deliberte           or accidental would potentially cause a very serious
problem inside.                 All of this on page 10.


On     page        11 the witnesses were aware of the          possibility            that
those     inside would be unable to control the crowd when it came
in     through           the gates and that it was vital for warning to                 be
given     to        those inside if that gate was opened.             Witness         said
Superintendent             Murray       took the responsbility upon himself             to
contact        Mr        Lock, the witness said that he had not thought                 of
contacting          Mr     Lock but Mr Murray had and that failure was                  an
oversight on his part, the witness understood that Douglas Lock
the     retired Superintendent of Police was Chief Steward and the
police        contact.          Asked who was in charge of the steward at the
west     end of the ground he said a respresentative of                     Sheffield
Wednesday           football       club whose name he did not know.              Witness
said     he did not think it was necessary for him to know who was
in     charge, he did not know where Mr Lock was but he knew                          that
the clubs control box was inside the main entrance of the south
stand     behind          the    players tunnel at page 12C         asked    what       he
thought       Mr        Murray    was    going to do if he    had     succeeded         in
contacting          Mr     Lock the witness said "I can only surmise                  what
Superintendent             Murray       intended   to do and that    would       be     to
inform        him that we intended to open the gates."                       Asked why the
■witness did not simply use the radio which he had been given to
contact        the steward in the west stand who was responsible                            for
the     stewards        in that area, he said that he did not                      know     the
technicalities              of the Sheffield Wednesday radio system and                      Mr
Murray        took on that responsibility to contact Mr Lock from the
personal radio on the Sheffield Wednesday personal radio.                                 This
at     page 12D the witness would not accept that the action taken
!by    Mr     Murray        was     plainly wrong and     would        not     agree      that
endeavours           should have been made to contact the man who was in
charge        of the stewards whom he was seeking to co-operate                           with
rather        than     remain buried in the south stand                    (presumably      Mr
lock) .


To     the     Judge at page 14 the witness said it would                       have      been
possible        for     him       to have used a radio to get in               touch      with
either        an inspector or with the steward in charge in concourse
but he did not do so because it did not cross his mind and when
Nr Murray could not get through to Mr Lock the witness had been
alerted        to the idea of getting in touch with somebody but                           the
witness        did not appreciate at the time what he was doing                           (what
Nr     Murray        was doing)        the witness accepted at page 14 that                 he
was     aware        that     the      gates   were   being        opened     without      him
believing        anybody          on the inside was being warned unless                   they
happened        to     pick       up    the information       on     the    talk    through
system.         At page 14F it was put to the witness that the reason
for     club providing him with their own radios was so that he in
the     police        box could direct stewards if necessary as well                        as
police        officers but the witness said " you will have to ask Mr
Mole for the reasons.                  I am aware that we had a radio.              I don't
know that we directed stewards with that."


At     page     14G    Mr     Glasgow put to the witness               that    as    senior
commanding officer of this police opertion that his attempts to
pass responsibility to the club are disreputable and unfair and
the    witness         responded "I have heard what you have said."                         On
page     15 Mr Glasgow takes this witness through and the                           witness
agrees     that    the club gave full co-operation to the police,                a
expensive       surveillance system is an excellent system,               witness
said that he did not know that it had been at the club expense,
at page 15C the witness did not know that the club provided the
police     not only with the radio link within the ground but also
provided     the police with equipment so that they can break into
that     radio link and contact their own stewards directly.                   The
witness     did not even know that the police control b ox had the
ability     to overrid and break into the clubs radio system.                  The
witness     did    know        that   the club had    handed    over     exclusive
control     of     the    tannoy      system to the    police    for     emergency
purposes     and     knew       that the tannoy system was       checked      every
single     game     to    the satisfaction of the police,          the     witness
accepted        that the tannoy system was a very good system and                at
page     15F the witness was unable to think of anything else                   the
club     could     have done whether by way of manpower or               financial
expense     which could have better cooperted with the police than
what     they     did    do.     The witness accepted that the         club    paid
something in the region of £50,000 to the police for the police
resource.

Volume 3 of Bundle of transcripts


Friday 26 May 1989 - morning session
Page     16        continuing         Mr    Glasgow's cross   examination          of     the
witness D J Duckenfield.


At     page        16C the witness accepted that by deciding                  simply       to
open a gate and let the crowd in on block he was overriding all
the control systems that had been set up and agreed upon.


It     was        put       to the witness that by doing       so        without    giving
anybody           warning         either on the telephone, radio or by             word     of
mouth        he       was     overriding and ignoring all          the     communication
systems           which had been set up.            The witness responded that             in
opening           the       gates he was attempting to save life and               serious
injury.            The other consequences at that time, whilst they were
there,         were         not    the     prime   consideration     following          this
witnesses             further insistence that his prime consideration was
to     saving of life and serious injury                  andnot accepting that           he
had     made a bona fide mistake at page 16F Mr Glasgow challenged
him     on        his disreputable attempt to make the club                  responsible
for     that          mistake and the witness said "I can understand                    your
line     of       questioning" at page 16H the witness said "with                       hind
sight        I would say that that was a mistake.                  The point is         that
at     the        time I had other considerations."            He     expected       other
people under him to be able to work through the consequences of
what     he had done without telling them.                 On page 17 in relation
to     gate       A     somebody without instructions          from       this     witness
organised             two serials of officers to receive the crowd as they
came     in       through gate A.           Witness expected other         officers       to
take     action         which may assist when gate C was              opened       without
orders there was then discussion as to how the timing when gate
A    was opened and when gate C was opened and there was a                           delay
of     over       5 minutes between the opening of gate A after gate                       C
had     been opened but this witness said that his instruction had
been     simply "open the gates".                    At page 18/19B the witness says
that he could only see gate C on video and he did not know that
one     of     the officers under his command in the control box                             had
zoomed in on gate A with the video camera, asked whether he did
not     realise what his                 men controlling the cameras were doing at
page     18/19E           witness         said "activity in that control room                 at
2.50pm        or     thereabouts on 15 April was considerable.                        I     have
seven monitors to watch , the crowd scene and other situations,
and I did not keep a constant watch on every single screen.


At     page 18/19G the Judge questioned the witness concerning the
fact     that        he        had     previously given     evidence     that        Seargent
Higgins        had said that gate A was going to go anyway unless                             it
was     opened           and     he     gave the instruction to        warn     people        to
control        the        crowd coming in through gate A and to                 the        north
stand        but not the crowd coming in through gate C.                       The witness
agreed        with        the        Judges suggestion that the        north        stand     is
individually              seated        and if a lot of people came in there                who
are     not        seat        holders     there could    be   trouble        and     further
accepted           the     Judges        suggestion that that was what he                 had in
mind.         At     page 21A in response to further questioning by                          the
Judge        the     witness accepted that the witnesses view                       had     been
that     it        was     upto the fans to level           themselves        out     because
nobody had a particular place and said behind gate C there is a
safety        area        or a area of safety prior to the terrace                    but     he
would        not     expect people wanting to go to the match to                          remain
there.         Further           questioned     by    Mr Glasgow   relating           to     the
importance of a similar reception committee being behind gate C
when     it        opened        the     witness at page 21G did        not     recall any
impact        or     any distinct difference that the              relatively              small
crowd        had     on pens 3 & 4 when it came through the tunnel                          just
after        2.47pm.            Throughout     page 22 questions        by     Mr     Glasgow
concerning his awareness of the impact the opening of the gates
had on pens 3 & 4 and prevailicating on his answers in response
to     the     Judge           and     being ordered to answer at        page        23A     the
witness said " I was not concerned, not at that stage."
Continuing           on     page     23   there is    discussion     concerning             the
witnesses           initial        concern     prompting him to     order        a     tannoy
broadcast           to those specific fans to distribute themselves more
sensibly which the witness said was at about 2.3 0pm, during the
next     quarter           of an hour the witness was still satisfied                       that
the crowd was easing themselves out satisfactorily.


At page 24B the witness accepted that that the clubs control in
the     bowels        of     the south stand did not give           them     any        video
pictures        of        that stand.        And the club control would              only     be
aware     of        what     was happening if he either phoned              or        radioed
them.         The     witness        knew that there was a        direct     land           line
telephone between the police control box and the club box.


The witness did              not know where the clubs Mr           Lock was stationed
on     that     day.         If he had known that he was where he ought                       to
have     been in the control room the witness would have used                                the
control room.              This at page 24E.         At page 24F the witness again
accepts        that        he decided to withold the information                 that        the
decision        to let people into the ground to be a police one                             and
withheld        that        information from everybody on the afternoon                       in
question        and insisted at page 24H that he considered there was
good     reason not to tell the officers of the club.                       At page           25
further questioned             about his conduct in the confines                 of          the
club boardroom and what he said at page 25D the witness said "I
did     not     think of the consequences".               At page 25F the             witness
says     that        he     told the Assistant Chief Constable              the        truth.
Further on page 25 the witness admits that when Mr Jackson came
to     the police control box in his civilian clothes the                             witness
already        knew what the cause had been and then at page 26B                             the
witness        admits        that the assistant Chief Constable went with Mr
Duckenfield           to     a board room to see the Directors and stood                      by
in     that boardroom unaware of the fact that the witness was not
telling             the club directors the truth.           The witness would                not
accept          that it was deception but said that his                 decision             was
made     in     the        best interests he thought of the           operation.              At
page     27 the witness admitted to Mr Glasgow that he decided                           to
withold        information from the club who were responsible in that
ground        in     the    presence        of the   Assistant    Chief       Constable.
Further       questioned in relation to the resultant publicity                         the
witness       prevailicated           and     was then questioned by          the     Judge
resulting           in the transcript of the questions and answers being
produced           at page 28A.       Mr Glasgow referred to page 113 leter D
to E and the following discussion brought about a correction of
the transcript at page 113D so that it should read:


          "I would not go as far as that."


The     transcript has already been corrected in ink.                     At page 28F
the witnesses recollection                  is that he said to Mr Kelly words "a
gate    has been opened and fans               have entered" but he did         not tell
him     the        whole truth abou the police giving             the     instruction.
The    witness said it was correct that he did not lie but he did
not     tell them the truth.                At page 29H the witness admits             that
the     impression          which he allowed to be created that                the     club
were     in some way responsible for failing to manage this                           crowd
was unfair.


This     finished           the    cross examination of      Mr    Glasgow          (having
successfully made his point)                  and the enquiry adjourned to watch
a video.


The     evidence is continued               at page 31 at which stage Mr            Hytner
was     allowed by the Judge                to further cross examin the             witness
Duckenfield.               Mr Hytner questioned the witness about his lying
about     the supporters, about the Liverpool fans and the witness
said     that        it     was the stress of the situation             and    asked     to
publically            exonerate         the    Liverpool   supporters          for      the
overcrowding              behind     the goal at the Leppings Lane            end     which
caused 95 deaths.                 He said "I apologise for any inferrance with
Liverpool supporters as a whole."                    This at page 3IE and then "I
publically           apologise sir for the inferrance that people caused
those deaths".              This at page 3 IF.
At page 31 Mr Jackson did not cross examine the witness because
the     questions             asked by Mr Hytner covered the                  virtual        entire
remit     of       matters he would have put to the police officers                              in
the     case.            He     associated        himself   with        the    questions        and
accepted           the        apology       and   observations        made     by   the       Chief
Inspector.


At page 32 the witness was cross examined by Mr Woodward.                                      This
cross        examination extends from page 32 to page 42 and at                                page
32 Mr Woodward endeavours to recover the position of his police
witness        lisiting from him that the effect of the tragedy                                upon
him     has been that although he has a clear picture in his                                   mind
of     events        of the day he has found that with video                        tapes        and
information since that his sequence on occassions is incorrect.
The     cross        examination             by Mr Woodward is an attempt               to     mend
fences and the following are the only notable features..-


Page     37A the question is put "Did you know also that the                                   club
had the facility to and were viewing the police monitors?"                                       the
witness answered "I did not know that S i r " .


At     page        40A        the    witness      agrees that      it     would     have       been
advantageous              if        there    had been an electronic notice                at     the
turnstiles which could say " Listen to the tannoy11.                                "Ease back
      kick     off        delay"        this because it is         important        for        those
persons        outside              the ground who want to go in to know what                     is
happening inside and further at page 40F with regard to what he
saw of the police horse "the most vivid recollection was of one
particular           police           officer having some difficulty with fans                     -
what     I can only describe as around the belly of the horse                                    and
the     horse            and the policman seem in some difficulty.                        I     have
never        seen         it before at all."           Previously at           page     40E      the
witness        had        said that people normally steer a wide path of                           a
police        horse.            (The witnes or Counsel intended to imply                        that
this         was         due to        the    misbehaviour       of     the    fans     but      the
alternative              of course could have been that they were unable to
steer a wide path because of the crush.)


At   page   42 the Judge adjourned for lunch and   a viewing of
six minute video.

Page 43 the witness - D J Duckenfield further cross examined by
Mr Woodward.


Page     43G      having          referred to the major              incident       manual          the
witness         says       that once he or somebody else has once                         a     major
incident alert has been set in train the witness had no further
responsibility              or     role        in calling for those          services           those
responsibilities                 are     all     with   Fort    Operations          Room.           The
continued         re-examination                of this witness by Mr Woodward                     goes
from     page        43     to the top of page 47 in                 a    continued        mending
fences exercise and I draw attention only to the following:-


Page     4 6D     the       witness says he did not know that                      one     of       the
periferal         gates, the Leppings Lane perimeter gates, was forced
open     against           the     bolting of it and against                the     efforts          of
officers         and at page 4 6F in relation to what this witness told
Mr     Kelly      and       the        club Directors the witness             said        that       he
achieved some thing by his view - his concerns were that 54,0 00
people        could        cause massive disorder if they were angry                            about
his     or the police service actions and Hillsborough Stadium                                       is
near     a     park,        a shopping centre and private                   housing        and       he
needed        not only the escape routes to be opened for                            ambulances
and     emergency           services           but if the media or anyone                told       the
true     story initially I could have a major public disorder                                       not
so     much in the ground but around it.                       At page 47B the            witness
says     that        notwithstanding              the attendance of Mr             Jackson          his
superior        officer           the effective control was never                   taken          from
him.


At     page     47        the    witness Duckenfield            is       re-examined          by    Mr
Collins.         Questioned in relation to arrangements detailed in a
report        of 9 August with regard to escorting ambulances to                                    the
ground        at page 47F the witness says "no there is not                               anything
in     the     operational             order      for   1989 to      cover        this"       and     in
response        to Mr Collins question "and the reason that there                                    is
not     anything              is     because it was simply a replicar of                  a    1988
order and it was not updated" the witness says "in that respect
Sir".         It        was        not updated except for minor              amendments.         Mr
Collins        was referring to Tab 15 in the police bundle.                              At page
48b     the        witness           accepts that it was         a     potentially        serious
omission.


On page 4 9 the witness is questioned further for his reasons in
not     telling           the club or indeed anyone else the truth and                          was
asked        who would cause disorder and he said the fans within the
stadium        and then prevailicates with regard to precis ley                               which
fans,        he is questioned further with regard that to how what he
said     might           get        to    the media giving       the       public   the       wrong
impression              and        suggest to the witness that there was                  already
bad feeling against the police because the fans at the Leppings
Lane     end, the Liverpool fans already knew that the police                                   had
been     at        fault.           At page 51 Mr Collins            completes      his       cross
examination and Mr Hytner makes the point at 51F that hostility
of     the     fans after the match towards the police was                           in       large
part     due to their perception of what the police were doing                                   on
the pitch and on the track.


At     page        52     questioned by the Judge the witness                   admits         that
there        was        nothing          to stop   him telling       the    assistant         Chief
Constable           the truth of what              had happened when he came into the
control box, he did not tell                       him that he, the witnes, had               given
authority for the gate to be opened.


This ends at the evidence of the witness Duckenfield.

Friday 26 May 1989 - afternoon session
Witness        Assistant Chief Constable Jackson called and                examined
by Mr Collins



Walter        Jackson        is Assistant Chief Constable      (operations)        for
the     South         Yorkshire Police, part of his CV is given and on               1
May     1985      he     as transferred as A.C.C         (Operations)     to    South
Yorkshire Police and he has some experience of football ground.
At page 53E he says that he did not forsee the possibility of a
problem at Leppings Lane.


He is referred to the document at Tab 11 the covering letter to
shich     is dated 20 March 1986 which document came into being as
a     result      of the popplewell recommendations.            At page 54        this
witness         refers on many occasions to the importance of stewards
and     the      briefing of stewards and at page 55C in               relation     to
save     evacuation of crowds he refers to this responsibility                      as
being     for the police, the emergency services and the club.                      At
page     5 6A     & B there is reference to the           recommendation       being
that     stewards           should be distributed throughout the ground             in
accordance            with detailed pre-arrangement schedule            between the
the police and management and he said what should happen at all
football grounds in South Yorkshire is that the stewards should
be     briefed by the Inspector on the day in terms of where                      they
should go and what their responsibilities are.


At      page          56F    referring   to   a   club    internal memorandum
distribution            list    included the police in form       of     Inspectors
persual        who     was a police liason officer for the club dated                8
June     19 88        and the witness accepted that there was nothing               in
that     which        indicated that the stewards were going to be on the
terraces         at     all, it refers to stewards working in the              stands
and     stewards           not to deal with crowd misbehaviour,                  refers     to
gate     attendants           and turnstile operators and to the                  need     for
stewards to remain at thier posts unless told to leave them and
at     the end with emergency evacuation procedure and at page 5 6H
the     officer        says        that   he would not      have     anticipated          that
stewards         would        be     on   the   terraces     but     then     immediately
afterwards at page 57A he did not agree with that situation and
said     that     he        thought Wednesday stewards should               be     on     away
terraces        with opposition fans because he thought that they are
firmly     responsible              for that type of activity          throughout          the
ground.        Questioned by the Judge he said that the accepted that
in the memorandum it did not say that stewards should be on the
terraces,        this        is    a divisional memorandum but              certainly       he
would have expected the stewards to be involved in all areas on
the     ground.        And at page 57D he would anticipate them to be on
the     terraces           and at page 57F through H the witness said                     his,
the     witnesses, own personal view not Mr Moles view is that                              he
the witness, would have expected the stewards to be responsible
for seeing that supporters, whether home or away,                           got onto the
terraces,        and indeed took part if necessary in ensuring                           their
safety     at page 5 8B the witness said that he could have changed
that     part of the direction if he had wanted to but in fact                              he
did not.        On pages 61, 62 and 63 there is discussion concerning
the formation of queues in Leppings Lane leading upto the outer
perimeter of the ground summed up in page 64B by Mr Collins who
said     "what you are telling Lord Justice Taylor is                        effectively
this:     because           it so happened that people arrived                later       than
normal,         the        South    Yorkshire    police     plan,     and        the     South
Yorkshire       police, simply could not cope", the witness answered
"on     that    particular           day, which resulted in the             gates        being
opened     as the only option available to the officer                           concerned,
yes."      There is discussion at page 65 concerning the advice on
tickets        to arrive by or at 2.45pm and the police attitude that
the     strategdy of delayed arrival of visitors reduces the                              time
for     pre-match           disorder      problems.    He     said    dependant           upon
information           he     received the police should gear their time                     to
allow     supporters to go in in                sufficient time without                hanging
about outside


At     page     66E he accepted that the ultimate responsibility                            for
the      safety       of spectators in a football match is that of                          the
police.


At page 67 discussing the need for keeping clear access ways to
exit     gates       at page 67F it was put to the witness that if                          the
plan     involved          that there               wasno police presence to assist with
that     it      must be          a defective plan, the witness said                 certainly
part     of the plan would be defective and at page 67G concerning
police        officers       ensuring          that access way remains             clear    the
officer          said "I          think you         would have to    bear     in    mind     my
principle        as well that the stewards have a responsibility and,
of      course,       if the police officers identify a                   problem then       of
course,        they have a responsibility as well.                    At page 68 having
been     referred to the fact that there was no police presence on
the     terraces and referring to that as a defect in the plan the
officer        replied       "I would think that it would not                  affect       the
plan     in     as much as if the stewards identified a                       problem,       we
have sufficient police officers there to deal with that issue."
At     page         68C it        was put           to the officer that      he     had     already
agreed        there were no stewards there so they could not identify
the problem and therefore either the police must ensure as part
oftheir       overall        control          of        the   stadium that     there       was
stewarding or the police must do it themselves.                             In response to
this     the witness referred to other matters in the hands of the
ground        controller and at page 68F still referring to the                            plan
and     whether it was defective or not he said "I think you                               have
got       to        look          at    all    the options:         (1)        the stewards
responsibility,             (2)        if you have police officers available                 to
deal     with       that     situation             then the plan in my      view     is    not
effecgtive.


At     page     68G he is referred to page 25 of a document the                            last
paragraph        "clubs       should          be encouraged to       provide       perimeter
fencing       and    partitioning              as    previously     described"       and     the
witness        accepted that it was his document and he was referring
to     precisly           what Sheffield Wednesday do have at the                       Leppings
Lane end.


At     page 71 Counsel refers the witness to the fact that they do
not     have video of the crucial moment from between about 2.55pm
and     3.00pm           or     3.01pm to 3.02pm but the            evidence       concerning
crushing           clearly           started     at    about 2.5 5pm and     at     page           71H
reference           is made to the barrior in pen 3 collapsing at                                about
2.55pm        on     the        evidence already heard.            At page 72       there           is
discussion           as        to the perception of the police in relation                          to
fans     climbing              over        the perimeter being that it was              a        pitch
invasion           and        at page 73B through E reference to the match                          in
1988     when        there           was     a small    pitch     invasion   by     Liverpool
supporters           over        the        fences at the Leppings       Lane      end.            the
officer        said           that     they     had increased      the   numbers            on     the
perimeter track by 2 to take care of such an incident occuring.
At     page        74C        it is suggested tp the witness             that      he           should
perhaps        ask        the        Supporters Associations for           their        comments
after     a        match and he responded "I would have no objection                                to
that.     I know the supporters are very much aligned to the club,
so     I would hope the club management would pass that on to us."
Again     at page 74 this witness is asked about the experience of
Mr     Duckenfield              and whether or not it would have been                       a    good
idea     to get Mr Mole to come over for the day and deal with the
policing           of the event.              The witness responded that it was                   not
considered necessary, this at page 75A.


At     page 75 the witness considers the adoption of the                                previous
years     fan        in       toto     with     one    or   two    amendments,          and       the
amendments           at       75G related to public order controls                  and          five
serials       (50 men)          to be in a coach at Leppings Lane so that they
had manpower nearby.


Concerning           the        suggested reduction in manpower              this       witness
approved Mr Mole's decision in respect of it.
At   this point the enquiry was adjourned until Tuesday 3 0   May
1989 at 10.30am.

Assistant           Chief           Constable Walter Jackson was recalled and                      Mr
Collins continued his examination.


The    witness            was        asked    whether he had any        knowledge           of     an
enquiry           held by the football association into an instant which
occured at a York City ground in March 19 88 when there had been
problems           at     a gate and the need to open the gate                   because           of
crushing          of crowds arriving at the ground but the witness                                had
no knowledge of it.                    Through pages 2 - 4       this witness describes
his    movements               on     15 April arriving at       the ground            in plain
clothese           and     to the police control room at about                   2.00pm,           Mr
Duckenfield               and         Mr   Murray    came     into    the     control            room
immediately              afterwards.           He   Noticed     that the       cob     end        was
virtually           full        at     that    time he then browsed           round        at     the
Directors lobby then went to the Directors box in the middle of
the     south           stand        roughly above the players          tunnel        at        about
2.3 5pm        or       2.40pm and sat in that box on his own.                       There        was
nobody        else in that box at all.                 He noted nothing untoward                   in
the     stands.            At        page 5A after the game has             started        he    was
watching          the flow of the game and the ball went uptowards                                the
west     side and he noticed people coming out of one of the gates
and     then        shortly after than a lot of people started                         climbing
over     the fence, more and more people came over the fence right
up     to the goal line and this officer thought that it                              was        some
sort     of       crowd problem, pitch invasion.                 Hearing this          at       page
5A.B,C        &     D the officer thought in terms of hooliganism                           which
resulted          in     people coming over the top of the fences, he                            was
not    aware           of any tannoy messages at any stage whilst                          sitting
waiting.          Seeing what happened this officer went to the control
room to see Mr Duckenfield, this at page 5F.                           At page 6E having
arrived        at        the        control   room he found      Mr    Duckenfield              very
preoccupied             by what was going on on the pitch and said that he
was     unsure           of     what had actually transpired he                did     not     say
anything           about        a gate opening whether by the fans or by                      him.
It was about 4.15pm before this officer realised fully what had
transpired.               This I think with regard to the gate.                      At page 7A
the     witness           says        " I had a feeling that           somebody       mentioned
something           about        storming        the gates".     The witness          says     the
words     storming              the        gates could have     been    Mr     Duckenfields.
Certainly           the       words were spoken by someone who was                    official .
At     page        7F     he says "in fact I think it might                   have     been     Mr
Duckenfield".


At     page 7H in response to the Judge the witness states that it
was     from        Mr    Marshall that he heard that the                    gate     had     been
opened        and        further           at page 8A he had a     discussion          with     Mr
Marshall           the        ground commander and it was then he learnt                      what
actually           had        taken place.        At page 8D this       witness        explains
that     Mr Marshall was at the Leppings Lane Ground Commander and
was     not        responsible              for serials on duty at       the        turnstiles,
they     were           normally under Mr Greenwoods control as                      being     the
Commander           inside, but Mr Marshall accepted responsibility                            for
dealing        with           them.        That was not what the order said             but     Mr
Marshall           and    Mr Duckenfield had both told this                    witness        that
that     is what the understanding was.                       It does not say it in the
operational order.                    At page 9C there is reference to an overlap
of     responsibility                 at     turnstiles   but this      officer        did     not
consider that that overlap gave rise to confusion.


At     page 10 the witness says after a brief conversation with Mr
Duckenfield he went down to the pitch and spoke to Mr Greenwood
and     looking about him the witness could see a lot of people on
the     pitch a number lying down and could see towards the                                  fence
people        in     distressed condition, he could see police                        officers
around the gates which was open and police officers coming from
the     back of Lepping Lane terrace obviously in a rescue attempt
and the witness went back to the control room to gain access to
communication.                He wanted to ensure that sufficient                   ambulances
had been called and to implement the major incident procedure.
The     witness        did          not     say to Mr Duckenfield you            are     not     in
charge        but as Senior Officer there was at Mr Duckenfields side
assisting           and making sure that everything was done that                             could
have        been     done.           At page 11 there is          consideration          of     the
extended           incident          log        created through    the    force        commander
control        system.          There was a message timed at 3.07pm which set
in train the major incident and at 3.10pm "authorisation for OP
Support        from        A        C C" that is this         witnesses        authorisation.
That        gave     rise to the message which officers responded to,                             a
general message to report to Hamilton Road Police Station.


At page 12B this witness asked for additional things to be done
such        as the turning out the Head of CID to look into what                                had
actually           happened because the witness thought people had                             been
injured        and the matter would have to be investigated.                             At page
13     in     response          to        the    Judge with    regard     to     the     cutting
equipment           the witness says that the major incident plan having
been        instigated and essential services were turned out but the
fire brigade was not in fact summoned until 3.13pm.                                No cutting
equipment           ever       got to bear on the fences other than the                        fire
brigades.


It     is possible that the fire brigade did not use their cutting
equipment           because          the fence by then had been kicked in.                      the
first        fire tender arrived at 3.22pm.                   Mr Nesbit arrived on the
pitch       but this witnesses recollection was that his arrival was
at     about        3.12       or     13pm but the witness         thought        that     Roger
Marshall, the Superintendent had in fact got things pretty well
under       control and was doing everything he could at that stage.
There       was confusion at first between the fans, the press,                                 the
police        and everybody else in terms of what was going on,                                this
at page 14D.


At     page        14F this witness would with hindsight like to                          see     a
combined           control room, and this is in retrospect, which                         would
house       ambulance, fire service and the club all being                             together
because        I        think that type of co-ordination make for a                              better
rescue.            Probably              where       the    control room     is     now        only        an
extended one.


At     page 15B the witness says that in retrospect he would                                             like
to     see much larger gates to get people out if there was a need
for     perimeter fences, on page 15 the officer describes another
type        of fencing that he might like to consider, effectively                                          a
wall.         Page           16     the        officer      is asked to     put     his        mind        to
identifying              deficincies                and    the officer makes        some        general
suggestions,                 none critical of the club.               The officer generally
agreed         with           the        no     announcement      policy     of     the         witness
Duckenfield and with regard to the tannoy.


At     page        17        Mr     Collins          challenged the       witness     that           a     no
information policy could have been more likely to cause trouble
and     a     witness              said that with hindsight it               might        have           been
advisable to do so.


The     witness              accepted that there is perhaps in the police                                 sub
conscious          even thought that football fans cannot be trusted to
behave reasonably and therefore one approaches it on that basis
in      relation to the minority of football fans.                                 At page 18              at
about 4.45pm when Chief Superintendent Mole arrived the witness
briefed        him           and     in        response to the     Judges         suggestion              the
witness accepted that he, the witness had ostensibly taken over
control        then over and above Mr Duckenfield.                          At the bottom                 of
page        18 it is apparant that this officer witness took positive
actions        and left Mr Mole in charge when he left with Detective
Chief Superintendent Addis in charge of the mortuary.


At page 19 the witness jackson was cross examined by Mr Hytner.
From    page            19        through page 2 2 mr Hytner discusses                 with           the
witness       Jackson               the        situation around the        Lepping            Lane       end
turnstiles              in        that        the   bottleneck    there      and     the        limited
possibility             of         arranging         for queues of more than              a     limited
length and the fact that a large number of people arriving very
close        to     kick off time caused pressure around the                    turnstiles
which        had     not been experienced before.              At page 22G there              is
reference           to       the Working Group consisting of            representatives
from     the Local Authority, the Police, Fire, Ambulance                             Service
and     the        clubs themselves and all those parties                 examined           the
ground        to     decide         on     all the   safety   respects,        the     exits,
entrances,           turnstiles etc. to make decisions upon which is the
best     way forward, this at page 22G.                   At page 23, Mr Hytner put
to the witness that there was complatency in a                          group such as a
Working        Group         where the attitude was we have not had                   trouble
before        so there is no reason for us to have trouble this                             time
and     also        an inference that any suggestions may cost money                          to
alter        the lay out of the ground and that expenditure does                             not
necessarily              improve the performance of the football team.                        My
Hytner        speaks of the plan he has put to the witness which I am
unable        immediately to detect but the witness does the question
by     saying        that      he was not really an expert on that                   sort     of
safety        aspect.          In        response to a question by the          Judge,        Mr
Hytner        made       it clar that his plan would be to              have         parallel
queues        upto       a    much greater distance.          At page     24    there         is
continued discussion of what might have been and how the ground
might be altered.


In     response to a question by the Judge the witness said                             there
were     23        turnstiles here on the day and perhaps                 there        should
have been more turnstiles available to get people in but it was
the     same as the year before and witness again states that                                the
problem with this particular year was that they all came in the
last     15/20        minutes or so, this at            page 24G. At page              25 the
witness        deals         with    what they did      so far as writing              to the
people who had match programmes, wrote to Police Officer Chief,
went     to the Media and asked people to come early so that                                they
could        get     into      the       ground in plenty of time       and     there         is
further discussion concerning the policing of the crowd outside
the turnstiles and then at page 26 discussion of the monitoring
of     the     pens       by means of turnstile and computer but                  on        this
occassion          and on all occassions at Sheffield Wednesday neither
the     police        nor        the club were able to take advantage                    of     the
computer to assess the capacity of each pen which could only be
done     visually and at page 26F questioned as to the closing off
of pens or the entry to the pen to be closed off and references
made     to     the        operational         plan dealing with        the        problem       of
closing        off entry to any of the pens and the witness responded
"well I would imagine that it was a matter for the stewards".


At     page 27A the witness said that as a police officer he would
expect        the     club        to deal with that problem and               imagine          that
clear     instructions                 had   been    given in the     briefing           of     the
stewards,           this     at        page 27A.     At page 2 7 there        is    continued
discussion           as     to     the responsibilities of            stewards          and     the
police        in relation to the witnesses standing order and methods
of preventing anyone getting crushed.


At page 27G the Judge suggests that the trouble in 1981 at this
ground        was at a time when there were no radial fences and so a
cop     type situation existed and nevertheless there was crowding
at     one end and crushing and in response to this Mr Hytner said
"yes     and        that is why you need very careful                 stewarding".               At
page     28A Mr Hytner continued that he did not accept on                               behalf
of his Client that you can expect a crowd on an open terrace to
find     its own level without assistance and further on this page
there     is        reference           by   the witness to the       green        guide        and
stewards        responsibility               for    ensuring    the   crowd        is    placed
properly        if there is a problem and by tannoy if necessary                                and
then     at     28D the witness says "I think in the green guide                                the
club     management              are     responsible for       everything      within           the
ground        and, indeed , around the turnstiles".                    At page 28F              the
witness        questioned              by the Judge in the situation where                    there
were     no police and/or stewards on the terraces the Judge asked
what     had        been done and the witness said "I think on the                            day,
where     a problem was identified, then the round control                                should
apply     resources          to it."         Asked by the Judge what he meant                   by
ground        control the witness said "the police control or,                             where
the     stewards are placed, if they identify a problem, then they
should        deal     with that as well."        The witness agreed with                 the
Judge     when        he said "so it is really vitulant on the                    part     of
those     who        are     in a position to see".     At page        29     there        is
discussion           concerning        communciations   between those             on     the
ground        side     and those between the turnstile and              the        central
tunnel,        the     witness agreed that nobody around           the        turnstile
would     have        any idea that pens 3 and 4 were getting filled                       to
capacity so there was a need for some form of communication and
then     Mr     Hytner moves through the question of the                    gate        being
opened        and     the emergency arising and questioned             the         witness
concerning           the     gates in the perimeter fence to the pitch                   not
being     opened           save   as    a result of the order     of        the        senior
officer unless there is injury.                 The witness did not accept the
suggestion           that     crowd invasion and pitch invasion was at                    the
most     in     his mind and Mr Duckenfield did his briefing                       and     he
ensured        that safety aspects was included.           The pitch              invasion
syndrome        was        further     explored with the witness who              did    not
accept        the     suggestion and eventually the witness said he                      did
not     know        what was in the mind of the police on the                 perimeter
track     but the Judge directed Mr Hytner to put those                       questions
to the officers concerned.

         Tuesday 30 May 1989 - morning session


         Mr W Jackson continues to be cross examined by Mr Hytner.


         Mr      Hytner         questioned      this   witness    in    relation to        the
         impression          that     there police officers hanging around           on    the
         ground        doing nothing and to this the witness said that all                  of
         his     police officers are trained in terms of saving life and in
         terms        of the effort to round the gates, the gates were narrow,
         already       police officers         were coming down the back in Leppings
         Lane,         those        officers    apparantly    hanging     around in        the
         background          could      not get themselves involved at       that      stage.
         The     witness deals with police officers who might have been                     in
         some     state of shock and there were fans who were in a state of
         shock.       Mr Hytner raised the question of the lack of the use of
         the     tannoy for any of the purposes it could have been employed
         with     regard to allegations of confusion in the situation after
         the bodies had been taken to the gymnasium and the witness said
         the     proper        person    to    ask about   this   was    Detective     Chief
         Superintendent Addis.


         The     witness       W    Jackson was cross      examined by Mr Jackson          who
         adopted most of            the matters put to the witness by Mr Hytner and
         Mr Jackson of Counsel was quickly brought up short by the Judge
         who     told him not to make           a speech but ask questions. At            page
         33F the witness states the planning for the packing of the pens
         was     two fold, first he would expect the fans or hopefully                     the
         fans     would find their own level and secondly the stewards                     had
         the     responsibility in that respect.             The questioning continues
         at     33G    and     H    when the witness       accepted     from Counsel       his
         suggestion          "it    is quite clear that everyone knew and had known
         for     years       that it is proper that someone should           oversee       the
         packing       and loading of the ground, may I suggest in this                   case
that     rightly              or     wrongly           the police gave that                 task        to     the
Sheffield           Wednesday              stewards.           The witness Jackson                 responded
"yes     I        would accept that ".                       On page 3 4 Counsel             attacks           the
witness           Jackson           on     the basis that the witness knew                          and        had
recorded           and       minuted all the problems that in fact                                 did        show
themselves              on        this     day and the witness agreed that                          in        1981
there        was a problem at Leppings Lane, a crushing problem.                                                To
this     the        witness said that the 1981 problem was addressed                                            in
1981     and he thought resulted in the alteration of Lepping Lane
so     that problem had been addressed.                                At page 3 4E it was put to
the     witness              that        he was aware of the problem and                          had        taken
steps        he     thought were adequate and the witness                                   responded           "I
think        the        club are responsible for taking adequate steps                                         and
to     the        Judges question "that is what lead to the                                      pens        being
altered.                At         page     3 4F       the     witness        was        shown      standing
instructions                 at     Tap     11        page     42.      Tab     11        being     standing
instructions                 to     policeing           football matches                 South     Yorkshire
police        and        reads from page 42 "specific duties                                of     stewards:
specific duties to be undertaken by stewards include preventing
overcrowding,                 ensuring           that crowd limits in various parts                             of
the     ground are complied with and that gangeways and exits                                                  are
kept     clear"              the witness agreed.                 So far as this witness                      knew
there        was        no discussion as to how that was to be carried                                         out
and     unless the word crushing be replaced with the word                                               safety
the     witness agreed that there was not a single observation                                                  in
any     of        the        standing           orders or        the     daily           briefings           about
crushing.               This        heard        at     page 3 5 to Tab             12     the     guide        to
releasing           football              and      at 1.44 the          reference           to     turnstile
control           in relation to supporters in possession of tickets for
one part of the ground seeking to gain entry to another section
of the ground and that resulting in some sections exceeding the
limits        specified in the safety certificate and the instruction
"where        limits are critical police should make arrangements                                               to
monitor           turnstile counts" the witness was asked whether he was
aware        of     any           such     arrangements              having     been       made         it    was
eventually              said that he was unaware of it.                             In response to the
directive           at        1.49 of the same document relating                             to     stewards
ensuring            that all sections of terraces and stands were                         filled
to      capacity           before allowing access to further           sections              were
possible            and     the suggestion by Counsel that the operation                          by
police         and        by stewards ensures proper packing.               The        witness
responded            "what      I    said earlier on, it would        be        a    combined
thing,         that        is   the stewards operating and the             fans        finding
their         own level."           This at 36D.    Counsel told the witness that
the      figures per turnstile were 1,443 per turnstile on Leppings
Lane      and 522 per turnstile on the Spion Cop.                    The witness said
that      he        hadn't known what the figures were and the                      witnesses
attention            having been drawn to those figures against the green
guide         he     said " I can only say I would assumed that the                          club
would         have     made the appropriate arrangements", this                      at      page
3 6G.


To      the Judge the witness said that he had not appreciated that
the      ingress at Lepping Lane end involved twice as many                               people
roughly            going through each turnstile as at the other end.                              At
page      37A        it was put to the witness that on the basis                       of        the
green         guide maximum notional entry from about 75 0 per hour                               it
would mean that unless the turnstiles were starting clicking at
1.00pm         and        never      stopping they would never have             filled           the
Leppings           Lane end as people would not have got in. The witness
accepted            this     and     said I can only say that that would                    be     a
matter         that        would     be   dealt with locally and      by         the        club.
Further         on        page 3 7 the witness accepted that without                 orderly
queues         the        flow through the turnstiles        would be           reduced           by
2.25pm,            the witness was referred to composite album number                             1,
photographs               2 0A and     24A   and   Counsel   makes    a         point        that
apparantly            none of       the officers feel the      need        to       take         any
positive           action       -    the happy crowd, contended       crowd            walking
towards         the        ground, and the witnesses attention is                   drawn         to
photograph            19A at 2.17pm to which the Judge comments "it                          does
not look too bad there does it" and Counsel                    (Jackson) disagreed
to      the    effect           that it was crowded inside the          far side                  of
Leppings            lane.         The Judge says that five     minutes              later         at
2.3 0pm        looking at photograph 25A it is pretty jammed in there,
but     the      photograph having been put to the witness Jackson                  he
said "I think having attended lots of football matches nothing
unusual".


At     page      3 9 the Judge tried Counsel         (Jackson) that he      is     not
asking        questions and throughout page 3 9 Counsel endeavours                  to
establish the crowding around the turnstiles.                   The witness told
the Judge that it would be an extremley difficult operation for
police        officers      to have converted the stream coming down               the
pavement         into     a stationary queue outside the perimeter               gates
allowing         them     in at a controlled rate.       Although the       witness
apparantly          thought that if it had been organised that way with
sufficient          forces it might have been feasible but once              having
got a crush inside there are extreme difficulties once you got
to that stage.


At     page 40 the witness Jackson is cross examined by Mr                   Muller
and at 4 0D the witness accepted that the police woul dnot allow
procedure to exist for running a football crowd which includes,
of     course, stewards which they regard as being unsafe and                     the
police      by      the time this match occured had vast experience                 in
working       the       ground       both with very large crowds     and    smaller
crowds      and, specifically with Semi Final crowds.                The    witness
was    satisfied that it was going to be possible to control                      the
number of people going into pens 3 & 4.                 At page 41 the witness
accepted         that nothing as far as this witness is concerned                 was
ever     said to anybody that he felt otherwise but the witness at
41C    in     response to the proposition by Mr Muller that                 it    was
obvious       that      that     could not     possibly be done     bythe   crowd
finding       their      own level, the        witness said that he thought        it
possible       on the basis that there was a combination of the fans
finding       their      own levels, the stewards packing and where               the
police      spot a problem then they should deal with it so it is a
combination of all three.                On page 41 to every proposal made by
Counsel       to the witness that the crowd could be in difficulties
the    witness repeated              that he   would expect the stewards to        be
active      and     when       the    police   spot a problem     they   should    be
dealing with it as well.                   (always the stewards were put forward
by     this        witness as being prime responsibility).                The           witness
accepted           however at page 41G that Mr Mole with his                   experience
found it impractical to require Sheffield Wednesday stewards to
go     into        pens        3 & 4 for the simple reason that          the        probably
would        not     be        listened to and that took stewards out                   of     the
equation           and     the       witness accepted that that would              be        right
because        he was the local commander and he made local decisions
and     at page 42A Mr Muller establishes that the packing of                                  the
pens     was        commander Moles responsibility but then                immediately
afterwards           the witness retracts from the above firm                      statement
and     says        "we keep saying it is the police responsibility.                             I
mean I think it is a responsibility for everybody concerned who
were     at the match on that particular day" so quite importantly
at     52B     Mr     Muller puts to Mr Jackson "if the             police              officer
knows that the steward cannot do the job, it is a waste of time
even contemplating it isn't it", the witness replied "well that
would        be a commonsense approach yes."                Immediately        thereafter
Mr     Muller        says "therefore you cannot say: well                the        stewards
should        be     doing it ".         He had got to    forget about that .                   he
has got to say "can I do it" meaning the police and the witness
responded           yes.        The wiotnes however would not then accept that
it was necessary to have police officers in the pen but instead
if ground control identifies a problem or the officer in charge
of     that        particular         area Superintendent Green would              who        was
responsible              for     the ground itself spotted a problem he                  would
tell     ground control would deal with the situation.                         And           again
(back to the club)                  to the suggestion from Counsel that officers
outside        the       pen        did not notice it and    therefore         a        further
suggestion           that it would have been desirable to have                     officers
in     the pen.           The witness said "I think if we look back and                         it
is easy to look back in hindsight and say perhaps there should
be     officers in the pen or perhaps there should be stewards in
the    pen, I think it is a matter of discussing with the club to
make      the         appropriate           decision     bearing    in     mind                the
circumstances.                 At    page 43 there is further discussion as                     to
how     the     pens           should have been organised by this         witness               at
     page        43E was not aware that in 1985 a plan was drawn up by the
     club        which wculd have effectively provided separate turnstiles
     for the three different sections of the terrace, that is to say
       e    centre           area and the two sides but that in due course                          the
     club    had abandoned that plan and substituted the plan that                                     we
 have got here now.                      The witness was not able to assist with the
 question and at page 44 there was discussion of what the police
 saw        as        being means of evacuation.              The witness accepted                that
 the        perimeter fence was considered by the police as being                                  the
 means           of     taking          only a few people if the need arose,                 not        a
 means of taking out the full thousand people, this at page 44D.


 Further           on       page        44    Counsel took    the    witness     through           the
 position              in    respect of cutting equipment and at page                    45        the
 witness           explains             how   once a major incident has          been        called
 force           control can listen into the radio messages being                            passed
 a         the     ground          and force control has responsibility                 to        send
 various           services             inform   hospitals etc.      In    response          to     Mr
 Mullers           last          question concerning who it was that             called            for
cutting equipment the witness he would Superintendent Greenwood
will tell you that.


At     page           45 the witness was cross examined by                 Mr    Gibson-Watt
this        Counsel questioning resulted at 46C in the witness saying
that his recollection was that until he spoke to Mr Marshall at
a out        4.15pm he was under the impression that fans had somehow
 orced           their       way        into the ground.      This    witness     was        asked
whether           he    was        aware       of some reference being         made     to        the
television             monitoring screens to illustrate what had                      happened
 ut the witness had no knowledge of this and in response to the
Judge        counsel said that the question was put in the context of
Mr     Kelly's          visit           to the control room and the fact           that           the
question              had         not    been    put   to    Mr   Duckenfield     but             the
recollection                of    Mr     Kelly and Mr Curton was          that   they        were
referred to a picture on the monitoring screen apparantly                                         to
reinforce what they were being told.
At     page        47        the    witness Jackson was         cross    examined          by     Mr
Kallipetis               who       established    through the        witness            that    the
ambulance              service      did   not in fact take part in                the     working
group            previously         mentioned     and    that    there       is     discussion
thereafter relating to a meeting with the police identification
of     the        Chief Ambulance Officer after the                  Popplewell           enquiry
specifically              with      reference to football grounds in                    Sheffield
and     Hillsborough               was one of them.        Continuing on page 47,                 48
and     49 there is complicated questioning concerning operational
details           of     the       ambulance service and        something          called        the
Extended           Incident         Log which I believe to be a record                    of     all
radio            messages          passing.      My     impression      is    that        it      is
effectively              a     continuous      recording.    At page 49E            the        Judge
says        "I     am afraid I am not understanding this at the                           moment.
Are     you        saying          that from the time       when     extended           incidents
started           in the morning all messages passed at the ground would
be     heard at Snig Hill?"                And the witness answered "they                      would
be     heard           yes".       The witness said that he was sure                    that     the
message           about        opening the gate would also be heard.                      And     he
thought that would be recorded.


At     page        50    there is discussion betwen Counsel and                     the        Judge
concerning              the    document       being looked for and the              fact        that
something              is being transcriped but Mr Collins told the enquiry
that his understanding was that the message would not have been
recorded          because          it was not on the relevant radio                 frequency,
the     message          was on channel 25 and not 19 or 35.                       Mr     Collins
told        the enquiry that there was no tape of messages on channel
25     so     the log referred to is what actually was heard at                                 Snig
Hill.        It was agreed at page 51 that                 if it existed a transcript
of the tape would                  be produced to the enquiry.


At page 51 there was a luncheon adjournment.

Page 52.


Assistant               Chief         Constable   Walter    Jackson         recalled         and
cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.


Counsel           opened        his     cross examination by asking           the      witness
questions           in relation to the clubs attempts to reorganise                          the
entrances           in 1985 and the witness thought that the reason                          for
the     attempts           to reorganise were then segregation at the                       west
end.         The witness recalls discussing it with Bryan Mole.                              The
proposal           relating to the turnstiles at the west end only                          made
sense        if     having        seperated the fans before           the    entered         the
ground        you could continue segregate them within the ground and
it     only       made sense when you had a segregated                   terrace.           Once
there        was an end to the segregation at that end kof the ground
in     the        ordinary games the object for dividing the                      turnstiles
into     segregated             entrances as well disappeared.              At      page     52F
relating           to     the working party the witness did not                   think      the
club     were           represented on the working party but                thought         that
when     they           actually do the inspections at the ground the                       club
supplied somebody to actually go round with them.


The witness corrected himself in his                       previous evidence that            the
club were represented on the working                       party because     infact they
were not.


The witness was referred to bundle 1 - 4                      pages in from tab 9 in
relation          to      the    working     party   and     at   page      53      there     is
discussion              as to the make up of the working party a meeting of
which        took       place     on     18 April.    (It is not      clear         from     the
transcript what year is being referred t o ) .


At     page       53      it is established that the procedure                   for   making
suggestions to the working party was for such suggestions to be
     made     in   writing       first   anfl u l t i m a t e l y

     the representatives sitting on the working party.

 «      page       55 there is discussion to the fact that the need                                   had
     isappeared          for    the segregation within the terraces                           but     the
 witness agreed that there was still need for segregation a!
  etween stand and terrace and the witness said that this factor
 :     SOmething. that                         had mentioned to him.                   At page       56B
out ” ltn0SS lf people are controlled as they come through the
outside perimeter gates so that the fom      iines of blocks
however        tight,          against    the turnstiles, there                      should     be    ^
 ifficulty with controlling                        the flow           directly         through       the
appropriate turnstiles.


Mr     Glasgow endeavoured to follow this by establishing that                                        if
the     crowd       is     allowed to be restricted not                         only    behind       the
turnstiles          (outside the ground, but to go to the right of                                   tbe
segregated          fence       and    start      to build up              against       gate    c     a
Problem arises but the witness was not able to assist with this
particular aspect.
Questioned           at page 5 6H as to whether the witness was surprised
that     the     officer           in command at the 1989 match did             not     help
stewards        on the west terrace with this said he had                      circulated
that     stewards           were responsible for packing and that is as                      he
understood           it.     At page 57B the witness said that he would was
not     surprised           because he thought the stewards on the                   terrace
were     behind the actual terrace itself in the concourse at                               the
back     and     their responsibility was to ensure that people                         came
through         into        the    terraces        themselves   and     I    think     their
responsibility then was for identifying the packing                                 needs
that as he understood it.


At     page     58     the witness said that liason between                   the     senior
officer responsible for the ground and the club officials                                   had
been excellent over the years.


That     ended the cross examination by Mr Glasgow and the Witness
Jackson was then cross examined by Mr Woodward.


Who     immediately followed up the question of stewarding and                               at
5 8F    the witness said he had at no stage indicated to the                            club
they   should           be        relieved    of     their   obligations       concerning
stewarding.


There        was then discussion of the preparation of a plan and the
preparation           for     the match and at page 5 9B Mr Woodward                  quoted
form     a letter dated 15 May 198 9 written by Herfordshire Police
to     West     Midlands          Police "the reports I attach are              all     self
explanatory           and     you may take the view there is no                relevance,
but     at     least you should be aware of the previous practice                           of
people        speculatively coming to venues of football matches from
Liverpool       which         we have not experienced from other                clubs       to
such     a degree and their expectation that one way or the                            other
they     will        gain admittance to the ground".              The       witness     said
that that intellegence would have been extremely valuable                                but
he had no knowledge of it.
Mr     Woodward informs the witness of the incident on 13 February
1988       at Watford which prompted the above extract of the letter
but the officer had no knowledge of it.


The     officer       is    then questioned        about   general   intelligence
system       and     the    officer said that each force would          build     up
their       own intelligence about particular football teams and the
practice          is for one force to contact another force to get               all
the information back to the present time the police are looking
to improve on that and produce a national intelligence system.


There        is    further     discussion     of    methods    for   intelligence
gathering         and then at page 61 the actions taken by the             police
to     reduce outlets for alcohol and then at page 61G                 concerning
the     placement        of a policeman at each gate at the back of              the
radial fence and/or upon the terrace itself the witness said in
view of the problems on occasions with crowds it would be silly
to    put     a    police     officer in on his own into         a   terrace     and
consequently         the best method I would suggest dealing with that
(pressure         or weight of the crowd) is from the perimeter                track
or    in     a position where you could view the terrace such as                  in
the     stand.       - not in amongst the crowd which would            pose      all
sorts       of difficulties.      At page 62 there is discussion between
the     Judge and Mr Woodward relating to officers in the                 terrace
and     a suggestion that stewards should not be in any particular
difficulty         but     the discussions do not appear to make sense to
me.

Continuation             of witness W. Jackson being cross-examined by              Mr
Woodwood.


At     page         62H continuing at page 63A it is            suggested     by    Mr
Woodwood         that the steward          is more acceptableto the crowd, to
the     strangers than the position of a policeman and the witness
responded        that       that    really depends on    the     situation.        For
example,        where Sheffield Wednesday supporters are known to our
own     police officers then perhaps it is more acceptable for the
police        officer       to get to know them, to know who they are              and
to     make     sure how they behave.        On other occasions it is          more
acceptable for a steward to be dealing with that situation.


At     page 64 there is general questioning in relation to methods
of     crowd     control       and this continues more         specifically    with
regard        to the       position at    Leppings Lane at page 65 andthenat
page     66      at D the witness         says nobody at theclub, the FA            or
anybody suggested to him that the turnstiles would not be able
to cope with the expected throughput.


At page 67 the witness is reexamined by Mr Collins.


From     page       67     through page 72 Mr Collins     takes     the     witness
through       his        evidence   resulting in   the   witness     effectively
saying     that he had sufficient manpower there to deal with                      any
situation that arose but the manpower could not be used because
the instant which developed was not anticipated.


The reexamination by Mr Collins continued to page 74 but                       only
old ground was again covered.

Witness Superintendent Roger Marshall called and examined by Mr
Collins.


Superintendent Roger Marshall is Deputy Divisional Commander of
F Division and has 27 years experience as a police officer.                                  Mr
Collins        took      him through his CV, he took his present post                         in
1987.     He has experience of policing marches in the city centre
and     was     also      primarily responsible         for     policing         Sheffield
United's        football ground at Bramall Lane.                He compares Bramall
Lane and Hillsborough as both broadly the same, both very, very
good grounds.


There is some comparison of the layout of the two grounds.


The witness was Commander in the ground at the 1988 semi-final.
The role that Mr Greenwood fulfilled in 1989.


This     officer's          function     in 1989 was responsibility                  for     the
Liverpool          fans but with a dual role as well to look after                           the
local     population             to see that traffic moved with a minimum                     of
inconvenience               to     protect     shops, property         and     our         local
residents as well as looking after the welfare of the fans.


This     officer           was at the turnstiles once the crowds                built         up
from     about          2.15 onwards.        Prior to that from about           11.00         in
the     morning         he had patrolled the area and throughout the                         day
until about 2.30 he had observed the crowd in very good humour,
he     saw     a    lot     of     drinking of strong         lagers     but     no        undue
misbehaviour.               He gave evidence as to his briefings which                        he
himself        had undergone and which he gave to his inspectors                             and
from     pages 74 to 92 his evidence his highly repetitive of what
has     gone before and little or nothing new is introduced.                                 His
approach           to     policing     the     1989   match     was     that     the        same
procedures would be adopted as in the 1988 match.


At     page 92C the witness gives evidence of having decided                               with
Inspector           Sykes        to close Leppings Lane to traffic this                 being
logged at 2.17 when he made his request.


At     page 93 the witness give evidence that despite his                             request
traffic        continued down the road until half past two, his first
request was acknowledged but did not seem to have been complied
with.         At     page 94 this officer gives evidence of going up                          to
the     roundabout              to make sure the road was closed.              At page        95
the     officer describes the build up around the turnstiles.                                 He
says     the mounted officers in the area were doing their                             normal
job of trying to maintain queues and stop people shoving and at
that     time        there were 6-8,000 people approaching from                      behind.
The     situation              was     being controlled by the        mounted        officers
assisted           by the foot officers who were on the exterior of                          the
perimeter           gates        and     the    officer considered that         he     had     a
fairly        strong police presence although he accepted that it was
not an effective police presence in the light of what happened.
At     page        96B     the officer says there was a              very   strong         link
between        the drink which a lot of individuals had consumed, the
heat     of the day, the urgency which time imposed on that                             crowd
as it got nearer kick off.                      There was an almost blind necessity
to enter that ground come what may.                       The officer had never come
across anything like it in his life and as time went on we lost
our     ability           to     manage that situation.        The     officer       had      no
evidence as to whether the majority of people that went through
the     turnstiles              or     went    over the parapets     were      not     ticket
holders.            The officer expressed a suspicion that a                    tremendous
number        of non-ticket holders got into the ground that way.                            At
page 97E the officer says "what happened on that particular day
is     going to live with me a long, long time.                      My perception            of
that     incident              was that there were very many people              who    were
determined           to        enter     that football     ground,     irrespective          of
police        officers,              irrespective    of   mounted     police     officers,
irrespective              of     advice given over the tanoy, irrespective                    of
the     best efforts of Sheffield Wednesday's ground staff and the
police        officers      who    were    behind the   turnstiles,      and    were
determined to enter the football ground.                 I cannot say how many
of     those had tickets or had not got tickets".               At page 99        the
officer        gives evidence of what he did at about 2.40.              At      page
99A he needed to try to get this crowd to ease back and to stop
pushing and he wanted some tanoy announcements made to actually
have     that     done.        He radioed ground control and asked them            to
send     me some and I also asked for PC Buxton who is normally                     a
Land     Rover       driver to drive the Land Rover which has a                public
address        facility        on the top of it.     I asked for PC Buxton         to
come     round       and to actually reinforce the tanoy           announcements
from     the back of the crowd in Leppings Lane.               The officer        got
no     acknowledgement            from    ground control and he     realised      the
radio     was dead at that stage.              The officer changed his set         to
channel        35 which is the Hamilton Road Ordinary             Sub-Divisional
Police        Channel       and   asked    the controller to      send   him     some
reinforcements           via      match control and also to get him the tanoy
announcement and to               get PC Buxton round to Leppings Lane.          Just
prior     to     switching        channels    the witness heard     Buxton      come
across        his radio which was on          talk through saying "I am on        my
way".     I know that message was timed in Hamilton Road at 14.44.


The     witness       saw      PC Buxton with     his Land Rover stuck     in     the
middle        of Leppings Lane but could not hear what he was saying.
The witness heard a tanoy announcement being made but could not
hear what was bring broadcast.                 The witness was standing on the
bridge        from    where        he could get the best view      and   said     the
situation worsened by the minute caused by the influx of people
into     the     area, an emormous throng of people coming               into     the
area from the Leppings Lane roundabout and from Catch Bar Lane.
At     page     100 the witness says he doesn't know where they                  were
all     coming from but his suspicions were that they were                   coming
from     public houses.            Still at page 100 the police officer says
that     those       people were certainly visible to          police     officers
within        the general sector and should not have been a               surprise
but certainly nobody informed him.
At page 101A the witness describes the action that was taken to
recover the position as follows


Inspector           Hand-Davis threw a cordon of mounted officers across
the     entrance             to     the turnstile area.            At one stage              the     blue
perimeter           gate          was     closed       to   minimise   the     crush            in      the
turnstile area before A - G but the gate was forced open by the
press       of people.              People were actually climbing underneath the
bellies          of the horses.                But the officer, although he said                         it,
did not see that happen.                         This was information he received from
Inspector Hand-Davis.


At     page        10IF       the       witness says that in view              of        the       closed
circuit          television              camera       which is inside the           ground           which
would        show        ground          control the situation at and                outside            the
turnstiles             he     anticipated that Mr Duckenfield or                         whoever          in
ground        control             would        take    independant     steps        to       send        him
reinforcements                if        that    was thought by ground control                      to     be
necessary.           Apparently this witness' request for reinforcements
was     not        logged but reinforcements were in fact sent from                                      the
gymnasium           by       Inspector Sewell who sent the reserve serial                                 20
round       via        the        bottom        gangway of the north         stand           and        also
mounted          officers attended from Penniston Road.                        At page 102B &
C     the     witness says that the position at quarter to three                                        was
that        people          were        already going over the parapets,                     over        the
gates,           and the witness saw one of his inspectors, actually one
of the ground control Inspectors, Inspector Bennett was himself
up     on     the        roof of the turnstiles and this                    officer            was       not
sending           people          back but was effectively helping them over                              or
allowing           them       to go over. The witness wondered why                           Inspector
Bennett          was        doing        this momentarily but this was                   a     fleeting
thought.               The         witness        that      some   people      were            behaving
responsibly in the height of the crush.                              The witness managed to
get     to where Inspector Bob Purdy was by the long barrier which
runs        to     the right of turnstiles A - G and he was told                                   by     Mr
Purdy that the situation was that people were being crushed                                               at
the     front        of the turnstiles A - G and that we must                      open           the
gates        to     allow this crush of people to get into                   the        ground.
Purdy        just        said     gates.        There were gate A, B and C          as        this
witness           knew        and the witness sent a message for the gates                         to
be     opened        and did not differentiate between gates C, B                            or     A
himself.            The       witness confirmed that he sent a message                       gates
in     the        plural.         This     officer witness was       not     happy           about
having        the        gates     opened because it negated             everything           that
they     had set out to achieve in that drunks would have got into
the     ground,           the     hooligan       element would have        got     into           the
ground,           non-ticket holders would have got into the ground                               and
that     would have completely kicked into touch all the good work
that         we had       done     to prevent those         things    happening.                  The
officer       was         talking when he referred to drunks to a                   man       who
has     taken        four or five pints of beer and has got to                      a        stage
where        his     own selfishness             is   getting in     the     way        of    his
reasoning.               On     a normal match day that sort of             person           would
not      get into the ground not if the turnstile constables                                 were
doing their job. All of this at page 103.


At     page        104D this witness says at the time it                   never        crossed
his     mind what the consequences of opening the gates would                                     be.
This     witness              said that he could only make the             request it was
Mr Duckenfield who would make the decision.


At     page 105A the witness says that his perception was that                                     he
had     to        make the request twice.              He perceived that         the         radio
was     still        not functioning so he did what he had                   done        before
and     changed           back to channel 35 on his multi channel                   set           and
passed        the        request to Hamilton Road but he did not know                         that
ground        control           actually        received   his   first     request.               The
witness           subsequently           says    that he made three        requests,              the
first        request was to open the gates and a little time went                                  by
and     nothing           happened and the situation was             deteriorating                 as
minutes           and seconds went by so he radioed again and said could
you     open the gates and he was still not getting through so                                     he
jumped        down off the parapet and ran across to Inspector                               Ellis
who     had     an old Burndept radio and made a request on that                                             and
went     back        to     the bridge parapet and tried                     again           to     ground
control        and on        that occasion had told                  ground            control that
unless        the     gates were opened people would lose                              their        lives.
The     witness           subsequently was not sure whether the request                                       he
thought        he     made to Hamilton Road might not have been in                                       fact
to     ground control.                 The witness says that he is now aware that
gate     C     was        opened by accident when a fan was                        ejected              by     a
constable           through C gate.                This witness wanted all three gates
opened.        The witness then saw C gate closed by use of a mounted
officer        and then           mounted          officers and       footofficers                       went
forward        and        actually           succeeded        in closing      the        blue           steel
perimeter           gate     which           helped     relieve some         of        the     pressure
because        people        were           still going through the               turnstiles                 and
clambering over the top of the wall.


At     page 108 the witness speaks of the gate which the                                          officers
had     succeeded           in     closing, the perimeter               gate,          weighing               10
hundredweight              was     shaken physically and was waivering at                                    the
top     and     the        witness was concerned that the horses                              would           be
injured        on the other side but the gate in fact was thrust open
and     the     horse was brushed aside and people then                                 surged into
the     area in front of the turnstiles once again.                                    This at page
108C.     The        witness           saw gate C opened again at 2.52.                            It    was
opened        wide     and        remained open and people moved                       through            the
area     in big numbers.                    He was hoping for gate A to open but                              it
did     not     open        in fact until 2.58 when the witness                              asked           for
that     gate        to be opened.                He called it the gate to                   the        north
stand.         The officer is unable to give numbers as to the number
of     people        passing           through        the     respective      gates           but        said
probably thousands through gate C.


At     page     109D        the        witness was aware of a               radio       message              of
trouble        inside        the        ground and a general            request              for        every
available            officer           to    go    to       the   ground.         He     left        Chief
Inspector        Waring           to        endeavour to stop the            people          who        were
still     at     the       turnstiles              and still       outside        from        going          in
because        clearly        there       was trouble inside.       It did       not     make
good     sense        to   allow extra people to come in.                 This       witness
went     inside the ground through gate C and through the                            central
tunnel     at three or four minutes after 3.00pm and saw people in
the     tunnel        bringing out injured people.              There were a lot           of
police     officers           in and around the concourse and              the       tunnel.
Initially        it     was     the fans themselves who were              bringing        out
comrades.         There was absolute chaos and this witness tried                          to
mobilise       all the officers who were there to try to save                           lives
and     they     did.      The scene started from the tunnel                   and     spread
over     the     concourse.          At        page 110H the   witness     states       that
Sergeant       Morgan         went in there (presumably the tunnel) with                    a
lot     of police officers. They were pulling people out. Officers
were trying to give cardiac massage to resuscitate them.


At     page 112B this witness did not learn anything which led him
to     think     that      people         had died in the tunnel         but    they     had
suffered on the terraces and brought out through the tunnel.


At page 112 the witness is cross-examined by Mr Hytner.


Mr     Hytner's       cross-examination              of this witness was        at     first
directed       towards        what        he     had said   about   drunken      pushing,
shoving,        misbehaving               fans      being   unmanagable        and      more
unmanagable       the      closer the time came to 3.00 but the                      witness
said he thought that his summary concerning the fans was a very
fair summary.


At     page 117 Mr Hytner put it to the witness that although some
fans    might     have been drunk and some fans were                   impatient         the
problem     at the Leppings Lane turnstile area was caused not                            by
them    but by the mass of people who had come down Leppings Lane
drunk     or sober well or ill disciplined and who were allowed to
join the throng already massing outside the gates.                         The witness
did not accept the word "allowed" and said "the police officers
who    were present outside Leppings Lane turnstiles and were the
same     sort of numbers as last year, were doing their very                            best
to     maintain   order and to do the job which they have          done   on
many,    many previous occasions, and to do it properly.            To    say
that     we   allowed   these   people   to   enter   the   area    is    an
implication that we were somehow abrogating our responsibility,
and that is just not true.


The enquiry adjourned until 10.00am the following morning.

Morning session - page 1
Superintendent                    Roger     Marshall recalled, cross-examined by                     Mr
Hytner (continued).


Mr     Hytner           opened his cross examination by asking the                        witness
about        gates           at the entrance to the tunnel.                 The witness         said
that     he        was well aware that there are gates both ends of                                 the
tunnel        at        the entrance to the tunnel from the                    concourse            and
the     terrace              end as well.        This witness expressed the               opinion
that     neither                 of those gates should ever be closed               while           the
ground       was            in     use    because the     gates     would      actually         open
against           a     crowd        flow    by which he meant that            if   they        were
closed        and people wanted to leave pens 3 and 4 in a hurry they
would        come up against a closed gate and there would be no                                    way
that     that           gate        would     open outwards and        in     response         to     a
further           question the witness agreed that the best option would
be      to            use        manpower     across    the   whole     of    the     entrance
(presumably                 the     tunnel) to divert fans to the wings                   or,        in
response to the Judge, a temporary barrier.


At     pages           1 through 4 Mr Hytner continues with the witness                              in
relation           to        him     closing the road and the size of               the        crowd
approaching                 the     turnstiles and endeavours to obtain from                        the
witness           an        admission       that even had everyone been             sober           and
gentlemanly                 and not pushing or shoving there would have                        still
been     difficulties in getting the people through the turnstiles
in     orderly              queues because of the vast number of people.                            The
witness           stuck to his ground that reasonable people would                              have
made reasonable queues at the request of police officers but at
page         4E        the        witness    agreed     the   the     signposting         on        the
turnstiles             was confusing and it was not easy for fans to                            know
which turnstile to aim for.


Put again to this witness what sober respectable people do in a
crowd        situation in getting to the turnstiles this witness said
"in    my experience, they wait patiently until their turn                         comes
to     enter     a turnstile.        They do not shove.      They do not           push.
They     chat     to police officers.         They stroke the horses.               They
wait     until the opportunity comes to enter a turnstile and that
is the way it happens".


At     page 6A the witness accepted that the pre-arranged plan did
not     take     account of the unprecedented numbers which were                     now
coming       down the lane, drunk or sober.             At page 7 Mr Hytner           at
last     had     some success with this witness in            that        postulating
that     everybody        is     sober and well disciplined,         if     they     are
continuing        to    move forward willy nilly, there is going to                   be
pressure        building up within the already packed turnstile area,
or     if the perimeter gates are closed, in the area between                        the
perimeter        gates and the roadway there is going to be                  pressure
from     the     back     being transmitted forward.         That is       bound      to
happen        is it not?       And the witness said yes.       The witness also
agreed       that if people are crushed at the front they will                      tend
to     cry     out and jostle to try to get a space            for        themselves.
The     witness        agreed     that   he heard the     crying     and     saw     the
jostling.         This at page 7A, B and C.         Beyond that this witness
was     not prepared to go and continuing on page 7 through page 8
by     which     time     effectively      the witness did     not        accept     the
suggestions        being made by Mr Hytner but eventually at page                     8H
accepted that if the thrust of Mr Hytner's argument was that as
time     progressed        the     police in the area lost the            ability     to
manage that situation, then he agreed with Counsel.


At     page 9B in response to the suggestion by Mr Hytner that the
police        lost the ability to deal with the situation not because
of     drunkeness or ill-behaviour but because of the sheer weight
of     numbers     the witness responded "I think the              situation         was
complicated        -     was     made more complex - by      the     drink     factor
because,        as I explained yesterday, people who have taken drink
are less amenable to police advice.
At     pages        10 and 11 Mr Hytner failed to make further                      in-roads
into     this witness' attitude.                  At page 12 the Judge         endeavours
to     shift        the witness from his attitude but                without        success.
Page     13, 14 - further approaches are made by the Judge and                              Mr
Hytner to shift the attitude of the witness without success but
at     page     14H in response to Mr Hytner's suggestion that                            "many
things        had     not        occurred previously that can be             foreseen       by
people who sit down and analyse the situation.                         Now we have had
the tragedy.           Can you now with hindsight look back and consider
the possibility that however brilliant the policing and however
calm     the crowd, the end of Leppings Lane by the turnstiles was
simply not sufficient to accommodate a crowd of this nature and
that     sooner        or later this tragedy was going to                   occur?"        The
witness responded "I think that is a very fair summary yes".


Mr     Hytner        then explored some possible escape routes which                        he
thought        might        have been left open which were demonstrated                     by
the     witness            not     to   be viable     possibilities         and with       his
previous small success Hytner was tempted to endeavour to shift
the     witness from what he had said about the pressure on gate A
and     the     suggestion from Sergeant Higgins that that                      gate       was
going to be broken down anyway.                     It was put to the witness that
the     simple pressure of the crowd may well have broken open the
perimeter fence gate and the witness responded "I have no doubt
in     my mind whatsoever that the blue perimeter gate was                            pushed
open by hooligans".


At     page     17     Mr Hytner turned his attention away from                     gate     A
back     to the perimeter fence outside the ground suggesting that
that     gate       was      simply      under pressure but      at     page        17C    the
witness        said        "my    perception was that gate was              being     thrust
open     by     an     hooligan         element".     At page 17F      Hytner       hhad      a
further success and very sensibly sat down.                      The success was:-


He     put     tothe witness "would you at the end of the                           day    now
having        had          time     to consider it all, concedein             terms       that
whatever            your    perception       of     the   presence     of     drunks       and
impatient           and     irresponsible          young men was one of           the        major
factors           in the press of people at the Leppings Lane                      turnstile
area        was     the sheer weight of numbers that were there                         in        the
road and in the turnstile area itself?"                        The witness responded
"Yes".


The     witness Marshall was then cross-examined by Mr Jackson who
adopted           entirely       the cross-examination of the witness                       by     Mr
Hytner        in respect of the matters on Leppings Lane and then put
it     to     the witness that photographs at 2.27 and 2.30                         and           the
like        in no way represents the evidence that the                       witness              had
given        but the witness asked him "Which aspect of my evidence?"
The     Judge        asked       Counsel        whether he meant the        mood        of        the
people that one can see there and Counsel agreed.


At     pages 19, 20 and 21 Mr Jackson endeavours to succeed in the
areas        where     Mr     Hytner might have failed and                continues          with
questioning           which       I consider do not warrant           detailing              here.
But     at        page 22D the witness is asked "did you ever                      take           any
steps        to     check     with     anyone the rate of        ingress          into           this
ground        over the preceeding few months?"                 The witness          answered
"it     is not possible to do that because the turnstile                            computer
which        operate down in the club's offices show a rolling figure
and,        if you        need    to take an abstract         from    that,        you       must
either        be     satisfied with a moving total or the machine, as                               I
understand           it, is stopped - the machine has to be stopped - so
that        the totals can be taken from it."                 It is apparent that                   a
document          had been produced but the document does not appear to
have        been identified clearly in the transcript and Mr                            Jackson
put     it to the witness "wherever the document came from, it                                     is
apparent            that     someone       at     Sheffield   Wednesday       knew           these
figures.            They    may      not have been conveyed          to     the     police."
Witness           Marshall said "they were not available to me.                         I        have
never        asked for them and I have never seen them before."                                  The
witness           agrees     that in view of what has been said                   about          the
excellent           liaison between the police and the club, no doubt if
the police should have wanted to find out any information about
what     has been happening in terms of crowd arrival, they                                      could
have got it from the club.                       This at page 22G.


At     page        23B the witness said "people who had tickets for                                the
wrong        area were approaching turnstiles only to be told by                                   the
turnstile           operator           that     his ticket was not           valid        for     that
particular           section of the ground.                Now that created               confusion
amongst           individuals,           who then had to find the right                    area     in
which        to     enter." Thereafter the witness is                       questioned           about
numbers           of people entering the ground at the respective                                ends.
At     page        24D the witness says that he was not aware                             that     the
club computer rings a bell when 15% less than capacity has been
reached.            At page 24H the witness he learned later that one of
the     turnstiles              was     infact     forced and         was   broken         and     was
rendered           inoperative.           At page 25 through 26 Mr Jackson put to
the     witness parts of the green guide and at page 26 Mr Jackson
put     to the witness "am I right that for whatever reason, be it
the     police's fault, the club's fault, lack of communication no
contingency              plan was in existence" and the witness answered "I
take     you        up on the comment that you made about it                          being        the
fault of the police.                    I read chapter 5 to impose responsibility
on     the        club.       The club had never perceived a situation                          where
overcrowding              would        occur     to the extent that it did                 on     15th
April        outside          the      turnstiles      - in     fairness       we     had        never
perceived           that either."              Mr Jackson made two final points with
the witness as follows


May I make it quite clear, for the purposes of this, as long as
it      is         not        the      fans,     someone      else      will        divide         the
responsibility.                  I am concerned to say that noone had                       brought
their    mind            to     play     on this problem in such               a    way     that     a
contingency              plan       had been drawn up and the witness                     responded
"that's right".


Mr Jackson then put:-


Secondly,           that        although       there   was a         monitoring       system,        a
computerised              system,        noone from the inside asked you, or                    nor
did     you ask those inside, as to the numbers of people and                                   the
flow        and the like during those three quarters ofan hour.                                 The
witness replied "that's right".


The     witness           Marshall is then cross-examined by Mr                  Muller          at
page        26.     Mr Muller asked the witness whether it had occurred
to     him        what    problems would arise when the crowd in a mood                          of
selfishness              and     a     desire     to get in     any   cost     reached          the
terraces.            The       witness replied that it did not occur                  to        him
but        there is a limited scope for movement inside a terrace and
one     must bear in mind also that individuals were amongst their
own        fans     and amongst their own colleagues and                     therefore          the
prospect           of trouble, whilst not exactly remote, is a situation
which        can be coped with.                 Asked by the Judge what did he             mean
by     a     limited           scope     for movement and the         witness     told          him
"well,        it     is        very, very difficult to have a big fight                    in     a
crowded terrace because people are in confined situations."


The        Judge     picked           the witness up on this and asked            him       "you
mean        the     way of controlling them is to pack them in as                          tight
as     possible?"              The witness responded - "No.            The situation             is
that        people        have        found their own level in         this     terrace          in
previous years."


To     questions           relating to the advisability of informing                       those
inside        of     the mood of the crowd before opening the gates                             the
witness            said        that    the      requests   he   had    made     for        tanoy
announcements,                 for     reinforcements, for the Land           Rover     would
have        all found its way to the police control box and allied to
the        video     view which they would have of the scene they                       would
have        been     aware of it but he did not communicate the mood                             of
the        spectators directly in so many words to the people in                                the
control box.


Mr Marshall is cross-examined by Mr Gibson-Watt at page 28.
The    witness         said it had never entered his head to request                     Mr
Duckenfield        or suggest to him the possibility of delaying                        the
kick     off.     At      page      28G    the witness    said     that    even       with
hindsight he did not think that delaying the kick                          off        would
have done any good.


The    witness         is cross-examined by Mr Kallipetis commencing                     at
page     29.    Mr Kallipetis asked the witness about the                   placement
of     an ambulance at the semi final in 1988 at some length.                            He
was     asked     about       the   methods for      contacting      the    ambulance
officer         from    the      control     box   and   Counsel     succeeded           in
establishing           four methods of contact.          They are dealt with             at
pages 29 and 30 and 31 but I do not now consider them now to be
of great importance.


At page 31 Mr Marshall was cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.


Immediately        in relation to ambulance officers the witness said
he     would    expect ambulance officers to remain with or                      by     the
ambulance.


The     witness    was then questioned concerning the opening of                       the
gate     and at page 3IE he says that there was crowd pressure                          in
front of B gate and in front A gate although there wasn't crowd
pressure        on gate C. The witness thought that he couldn't take
a     chance of nominating particular gates and asked for all                          the
gate     to be opened.           He has no idea why anybody would open gate
C out of all the gates where there were options.


The effect that there would have been if gate A had been opened
was     considered,        there was heavy pressure on that gate and                     at
page 32B the witness mentions the marking or lack of marking of
the     turnstiles        which     might     have caused    confusion       but       the
assumption was that most people were going into the north stand
and     32E he says he wasn't really worried about gate A                        because
the force of the flush through there would have been dissipated
in     the     gangways leading onto the north stand and the                     witness
accepted           that by opening gate A people might have found                   their
way     to the north stand who did not have tickets for the                         north
stand        and     he     applauded the fact of the        police     decision       to
ensure        that        there     were a detachment of police in           the    north
stand        ready        to receive anticipated additional numbers                rather
suddenly arriving at a very few minutes before 3.00pm.


At     page        34 the effect of opening gate B was considered.                    The
witness        Marshall           agreed that it would have been possible             for
people        to     have entered through gate B and then              turned       right
through        the        hole in the wall and to find their way             down     the
tunnel.            On the previous page it had become apparent that this
latter        point        also     applied    to the opening of      gate    A.      The
officer        accepted that the overwhelming probability was that if
gate     B     was opened the majority would be finding their way                      to
the     north pen which was relatively empty.                 The witness further
accepted           that     if gates A and B had been opened first and                the
movements           of the crowd observed there was still the option                   of
opening gate C and that the movement of the fans through gate C
into     the        central concourse their movements           thereafter          would
have     depended upon whether or not the tunnel had been                       closed.
This     at page 34D.              The officer could think of any       conceivable
reason        for     the single worst possible and           most     inappropriate
gate being opened.                 This at page 34E.


Mr     Glasgow        then        turned to the question of planning          and     the
witness        described his immense experience with Hillsborough and
questioned           about previous problems which crowd control at                   the
Leppings Lane end he recalls an incident in the late '70's when
Everton        were        drawn     against Wednesday and it went to          two     or
three        replays        and he experienced bad behaviour          and     fighting
amongst the fans at the end.


There was a discussion as to how the ground was laid out in the
1970's        and the new layout of the turnstiles in the closed 1985
season.        As         the   years went by      police   preoccupation          tended
towards        crowd segregation.             There was police sensitivity about
the     need           to        segregate Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s . A t                   H     the
witness            refers              to      the    hooligan    element        being         strongly
deprecated                  by     the      clubs      themselves     and    by     the        official
supporters              association              but it has become a factor               of     modern
life that each and every club has got element.


At     page 36 the witness deals with the closing of turnstiles 7 7
to     88        that feed the north end of the north stand forced                                    upon
the     police              by the need to segregate.                The witness          would        not
accede to the suggestion that Liverpool fans even in retrospect
should have been allocated the Kop because the hooligan element
in     each team could not be kept apart during the journey                                       round
to     the east end of the stadium by Liverpool fans and round                                          to
the     west           end        of     the     stadium     by   Nottingham       Forest            fans.
Segretation             must           be      totally     even at   the     turnstiles.               The
decision           to segregate the ground was a question of                              allocation
at the ends and stands rather than turnstiles.                                   The segregation
arrangements were exactly the same as had applied in 1988.                                             The
result of that decision as it affected the witness Marshall was
that        23     turnstiles               were available to the Liverpool                    fans     as
against           60    turnstiles               for the Nottingham Forest               fans.         The
witness           had        appreciated             the   number of people        he     would         be
dealing with at Leppings Lane end through twelve turnstiles and
although          with hindsight it might be said that it would need                                     a
lot     of        additional people to cope with what was going to be                                    a
fairly           stretched facility he was conscious that it had                                 worked
well        enough          the        previous        year but that       the    situation           was
different this year.


In     answer to the question from the Judge the witness was                                          only
aware        of     turnstiles having been closed at the Penniston                                    Road
end and those that would have used them having to go through at
Leppings           Lane on the one previous fixture the witness did                                    not
whether they had been closed in the 1987 semi-final.                                      The Judge
having           raised          the point Mr Glasgow elicited from the                        witness
that     right          or         wrong it is a simple fact that                 closing        those
turnstiles             does add enormously to the loading of Leppings Lane
end.     T h is a t p a g e 38B.         The w i t n e s s   agreed.


At     38D Counsel turned to the green guide paragraph 46 where in
contingency plans are supposed to be drawn up at a ground where
the     available             entrances have proved to insufficient                       and        the
witness        said       that he had no evidence to indicate                       that           these
entrances          had        proved to be insufficient.               Questioned             by     the
Judge        on the basis that arithmetic could have predicted it the
witness said that since the incident he had done the arithmetic
on     the basis that Liverpool were allocated 24,270 tickets                                        and
if     all     those          spectators      had come within the             last        hour        32
turnstiles          would have been needed to get them in.                          At page 38G
it     was     suggested to the witness in respect of turnstiles                                     and
all     spectators arriving within the last hour that it would                                        be
unfair       both        to    the     police     and to the club          for       it        to     be
suggested          that       there     had     been no      contingency           planning           on
previous          occasions          to which the witness replied there was                           no
contingency          plan because the club never perceived they                                needed
one and neither did we.                 At page 38H the witness is referred to
an     occasion          when the police had discussed with the                          club        the
need     to open extra turnstiles and there was discussion on page
39 on the          basis that on games where there had been an intention
only     use        the ordinary limited number of                     turnstiles but                 where
police       have        intelligence that there were likely to                          be     extra
crowds       arriving          late and the witness responded "if                        Liverpool
had     come in a League game then most of the turnstiles would be
functioning          but if it had been a smaller club, Millwall,                                   say,
then     not       all    the turnstiles would be open.                  As        you        say,     a
matter       of     negotiation."             Then in response to             Mr     Glasgow           a
matter of liaison that the police would inform the club despite
the intention to have a certain number of turnstiles allocated.
The     police       knew there was a probability that a particular                                  of
group     offans were likely to                  arrive late to which the                 witness
agreed       and    the police told the club it would be                           sensible          to
open    more turnstiles that had been intended.                          To this question
the    witness           said that detail would have to be taken                         up        with
Inspector Sewell but it would be a common sense arrangement for
all     of        this        under      the     ceiling of    the    maximum      number        of
turnstiles.                 (I    do not understand the intended meaning of                     the
transcript              at       this    point,     I think it might       relate        to     the
meeting           concerning other matches but then certainly in respect
of     the        1989 cup final the following:-)                    for this     game        there
were     no other turnstiles that could be                       opened unless theywere
going        to        be     built especially for            the occasion and the            only
other        experience             of contingency planning there had               been       was
when     there              had beena debate about the police taking                 off       the
excess crowd somewhere else so they could listen to the game on
radios.            That was for non ticket holders.                   This was subsequent
to the disaster, that was the Middlesborough game.


Further           relating          to non-ticket holders there has               never       been
such an arrangement before but there was a loose arrangement in
respect           of        non-ticket         holders for the    Middlesborough           game,
non-ticket             holders who remained in                the area once the game has
started       when           they       were    perhaps       not herded    but    asked        to
assemble          together and someone would usually have to radio                             and
they could listen to the game on the radio and absorb some                                      of
the atmosphere of it.

between the period before half past two and after half past two
the policing tactics had succeeded in keeping people roughly in
queues.

Continuation of a cross-examination of the witness R. Marshall
by Mr Glasgow.


In    questioning           the     witness       with    regard    to    the   principal
difference          between the period before half past two with regard
to    rough        queues being kept at the turnstiles the witness                       was
referred       to        composite album 1 photograph MWL 10 25A                 and     the
witness       looked        at    the     photograph        and   maintained     that     it
illustrated             perfectly       orderly     crowd    queuing      although      very
packed queuing for the turnstiles.                       The officer was not worried
by what        he saw as represented by the photograph at half                          past
two.


The     officer was shown photocopy MWL 15 28A and 6A and at                            page
41    there        is    considerable discussion of               various    photographs
which       continues        at page 42 when the Judge attempts                 to     limit
Counsel's          possible conclusions from the photographs.                    At     page
42H     the    witness says "having seen the video from last year                          I
don't       think there is any comparison between the rate at                          which
the crowd arrived and the way in which they were processed.                               It
seemed an entirely different situation."


Finally       at page 43 Mr Glasgow makes the point "the point needs
to be made that at two mintues to three I think last year, most
of    the     Liverpool fans were in the ground.                   At two minutes         to
three       this     year there was a very, very substantial number                       of
Liverpool          fans who were still outside the ground.                   Perhaps      it
really        only       unlines     this     fact,      Superintendent,        that     the
importance         and     the priority should have been to open gates                     A
and     B   which is where the greatest release to                       sensible      areas
would have come" and the witness responded "I would not dispute
that". This at page 43B.
The     w itn e ss     M a r s h a ll was t h e n    c r o s s -e x a m in e d by     Mr     Woodwood
com m en cing p a g e 4 3 .


The     witness        was       questioned         concerning         previous            events        at
Hillsborough           and        in particular the Everton game in                         the        late
1970's        and     there is discussion of hooped barriers instead                                     of
turnstiles           which        apparently        existed       at that           time.         He     is
further        questioned              concerning his experience of large                         crowds
who     were        unruly        at     particular matches            elsewhere            and        then
turning to the 1989 semi final the witness said that he thought
at 2.40 that the fans would still get through the turnstiles in
time.        At 2.40 there were probably about 3,000-4,000 to get in.
At     page        45D Mr Woodwood "Lord Justice Taylor made                               the     point
that     in        view of the excellent liaison if there was                               any        that
existed        between the club and the police, the police could have
enquired           (this        concerning      material        contained            in     the        club
documents           relating to turnstiles).                 On the other hand in                      view
of     the     excellent liaison if the club had any doubt would                                        you
have     expected          them         to   tell    you     concerning             the     turnstile
capacity?"           The witness answered "Yes."


Question           in respect of the 1988 match and whether he was aware
as to whether the tunnel was blocked off or not the witness had
not been in the area of the tunnel and had no knowledge of that
possibility.               He    would       however have expected to                     have     heard
about it and he did not.


Asked        about     the        policing of the 1989 event and                      the        serials
under        the     charge of officer Mr Greenwood the witness said                                     he
was     not inhibited by the actual hierarchy from making what you
see wanted of the serials outside.


At page 48 there is discussion as to the time of arrival of the
Wadsley train which was never precisely pin-pointed closer than
just     before 2.00pm when people from the train were                                     marshalled
and     brought down to the ground.                        There is then discussion                      at
page     49        of the movement of a crocodile from the trian                                  moving
towards        the ground and it appears at page 50 that the majority
of     the     people        or     at   least   those   in   the   crocodile        were
accommodated         in       the access at Leppings Lane andthey did                 not
create a problem.             (This I think by about 2.30pm.)


Pages        51 and 52 there is a lot of repeated evidence concerning
the     movement        of        people and disposition of police       and     going
through        to   page      55 the witness is questioned in          more detail
about        the incident already described of an attempt being                      made
by     somebody to push this officer off the bridge into the river
and     reference to a can of beer being thrown at an officer.                         At
page     57     Counsel           is questioning the     witness    concerning        the
opening        of   gate          C and at 57H and also at 58A over       the        page
which relates to the steward being in charge of the gate on the
inside        but   the       witness      said the steward would      need to         be
approached by a police officer to tell him to open the gates.


At page 59 the sitting adjourned for lunch.


(I     have     not given very much detail of the questioning                   by     Mr
Woodwood        because as usual this Counsel tends to recover ground
alreay covered and although he is undoubtedly making points the
points        he makes do not appear to me to be especially important
or to change the overall situation very much.)

Superintendent           Roger Marshall recalled in cross-examination by
Mr Woodwood.


Mr    Woodwood        establishes    with   the   witness   that     after the
incident he was sworn at and spat upon by fans and that was the
fate of other officers also.


At page 60 the witness Marshall was reexamined by Mr Goldsack.


The witness was questioned as to the names of officers who were
nearby     the       gate   which became opened (gate C)     and     he     named
Sergeant        Lionel      Proctor but could not recall others       at     that
time.


That     ended       the reexamination by Mr Goldsack and this            witness
was     then        questioned    bythe Judge at page 60    who      asked    the
witness at page 6OH and over the page at page 61A whether if he
had     been aware of that arithmetic at the planning stage of the
match whether it would have concerned him.             The witness replied
"concerned          may be the wrong word.     I think we would have noted
the     arithmetic,         but having regard to our previous       experience
perhaps        "concerned" might not have entered into the equasion."
The     witness       was notsurprised      at the arithmetic      because    the
turnstiles          were open    for three hours as distinct from one hour
so     based        on a throughput in one hour and 17,000 then           another
7,000     hopefully would have been through the turnstiles in                 the
remainer of the three hour period.


The witness was asked by the Judge questions in relation to his
concern        or     rather unconcern faced with 6,000-8,000 people           at
2.15 and his concern when faced with only 2,000-3,000 at twenty
to     three and the witness explained this by what he had already
said about the change in the mood of the crowd.

Afternoon session - Page 62
Witness        Superintendent Bernard Dean Murray called and examined
by Mr Phillips.


Bernard        Dean        Murray is Superintendent of Police in the                    South
Yorkshire           Police        and has been the Superintendent           since        14th
March     1988.        There is reference to this officer's duties at                       a
league     match between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool on 14th
January        1989        when       Chief Superintendent Mole was         in     overall
command        and this witness was the Superintendent at that                          game,
the only Superintendent present.


The     witness        was questioned in some detail about                 that     league
match.         At     page        64E in relation to that previous              match     the
witness        is     asked about the terraces and specifically "do                       you
think     it        was likely that they would be able to move from                       the
centre     pens to the side pens?" The witness answered "they                             can
and     I now appreciate the difficulty because there is only                             one
gate at the back on each side."


The     witness           is     then     questioned about the        planning     of     the
operation           for        the match on 15th April 1989 then at              page     64H
although        there           was no formal meeting as such on the              day     the
police became aware on the 20th March that they were having the
match     Mr        Mole        and Mr Sewell with this witness           came     to     the
conclusion           that        they     ought   to   repeat   the     order     for     the
previous.           The order was to be prepared by Chief Inspector Beal
and     Inspector Sewell but this witness' role and that of                             Chief
Superintendent                 Mole     was to overlook the order and           input     any
information           they        considered      to be necessary.        This     witness
received        an instruction to aim for a reduction in manpower                          of
10%.      A 10% reduction was received.


At page 65E this officer increased the policing at the Leppings
Lane     roundabout because it was a natural meeting point and one
which     they     felt        should be reinforced.           The officer    has       not
experiencedtrouble              in    that   area        the     previous    year       but
considered it to          be always a potential flash point.                Atpage 66
this     officer        gives evidence of a pitch invasion the                previous
year     at     the Leppings Lane end when Liverpool                 supporters         had
come     over          the top of the fences and round the sides                  at the
conclusion         when        Liverpool     had won. At page 66D           and   E the
witness        gives     evidence relating to the previous year when                     at
half     time     there had been a lot of climbing from the                   terraces
into     the     west stand presumably to get a better view                   although
there     were no seats for them and in view of this happening the
previous        year alterations were made to the duties of the                     west
stand     serials.            The climbing up had been mainly            between        the
centre        railings and the railings at either side of pens 3                        and
4.     They also came over from the raised terrace on the north of
the west side.


At page 67B the officer states that it was not part of the west
stand     serials' specific duties to look into the terraces                        down
below     to see how it was filling up during the hour, half                        hour
before the match started.                The witness continued to say that he
would expect all officers and all stewards to be aware of those
type of problems (presumably filling up).


At     page     35C the witness says that there was noone who                     had     a
specific        duty as such to keep a watch on the filling of pens 3
and 4 of the Leppings Lane terrace.                 With hindsight the officer
said that he felt there should have been.


This     witness was the Superintendent in Control. Superintendent
Greenwood was in charge of the ground, Superintendents Marshall
and     Chapman        were     on     the outside for     the     two   ends.      This
witness'        role was overall control of the Control Room and                        the
event itself and adviser to the officer who was in charge which
was     Mr Duckenfield.              This witness was particularly           interested
in communications and communications was one of the major tasks
he     had     to undertake.             Sergeant Goddard was to carry                out       all
radio operations both incoming and outgoing.                           PC Bichard was to
operate        the cameras and to operate the radio link that we                                had
with     our Force Operations Room and PC Ryan was to be in charge
of the public address system and monitor the telephones that we
had     from various places.               (This at page 68).          Mr Sanderson           was
communications                 officer   and    this    witness    had        asked       for     a
communications                 officer   to be present because there                had      been
some     problem the previous year.                    The previous year the problem
had     been        the        breakthrough from a commercial            radio        station,
music        coming over the radios.                 He checked on his         pre-briefing
with     the club on the Thursday before the event.                           This at        69C.
He     checked with the club and there was no local radio stations
that     would be operating and transmitting from the vicinity                                   of
the     police control.              Continued on page 69 there is                 discussion
of     this witness' meeting at Hamerton Road with Mr Mole on 22nd
March        when the allocation of aims was dealt with, the decision
being        made     by        the police having heard         representations              from
British        Rail        and from the Football Association.                 At      page       70
there        is discussion of further meetings at Hamerton Road                              with
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and the Sector Superintendents
and also with British Transport Police.


At page 70E and F there is reference to a meeting on 13th April
that     this        witness'        and Inspector Sewell had           with        the      club
secretary           and        after the meeting the witness           went        completely
round        the ground.           The things discussed with the club were                       as
follows


I     asked     the club if they were completely satisfied                          that        the
gantry for the TV cameras over the west stand was safe and they
were.        We had a look at that afterwards and it seemed perfectly
safe.        We did discuss coaches for executives who were coming to
the     match.            We     discussed     who     the   referee    was,       what         the
arrangements              would     be   with Mr Clough, where           he    would         sit.
Several things, general things.
This     witness           had never been concerned about signposting.                     He
had     never        noticed      the signposting and he said "I                have     just
accepted        the ground as it is".            This at page 71.         At page         7IB
the    witness         is     asked    whether    he thought       if     he     had     said
anything        about        signposting      whether it would          have     made     any
difference           and     he said "I think it may well have                 made.      The
club     might have taken notes.               When I first came to             Sheffield,
Hillsborough,              in 1988, I had a look round the football                    ground
then     and the only areas of concern I had were about the                             glass
in     the west end of the north stand and the club agreed to look
into     that        and     did come back to me and tell me              that     it     was
shatterproof, it could not be broken."


The absence of signs to people coming through turnstiles A to G
had     never        struck this officer and had never been apparent                       to
him.          Then     on     page 71 and 72 there is           discussion        of     this
officer's briefing note.


At     page     72E        through    G the witness      gave     evidence        that     Mr
Duckenfield           had     asked    that    a log be kept       of     events        which
resulted        in a computer log being arranged on the force command
and     control system on the 11th April and he opened an incident
for     any information or any entry in relation to the semi-final
to     be put on that computer log at Hamerton Road.                       This officer
also     wanted to try to keep a handwritten log as well from                             the
Control        Room.         At     page 74 there is reference           to     the radio
equipment        and       individuals radios being checked and also to the
checking of the tanoy system.


At     page 75F this witness says at 2.00pm the only problems were
the usual problems of people drinking in public houses and shop
lifting        and the usual problems that they associate with a                          big
event.         Those reports were coming in.              At page 7 6Dthe witness
says     that        his     view     of Leppings Lane     on     the     monitors        was
restricted to just the area outside the turnstiles.


Nothing        new is introduced in the evidence to page 81 and                          then
at     8IF           through          H     where the witness           says     he        was       becoming
concerned              at       quarter        to three that people             were           not        coming
through              the       turnstiles and he tried to get in touch with                                   the
club,        the           safety          and security officer who was Mr                       Lock.         He
didn't           succeed in getting through.                       He tried by radio.                     He had
a radio on the steward's and the club's frequency but could not
raise him.                 Immediately following his abortive attempt to raise
Mr     Lock           he       was        overtaken by what he           considered              were       more
serious              events,          the     requests for the gates to be                       opened        in
Leppings              Lane.           At page 87C it is apparent that the radio                                in
the        police           control began to malfunction at about                              2.42.          The
officer says that he had other communications available to him,
with        Hamerton                Road     and Force Operations Room but                       while        the
radio       was            down he had no channels that he could work                                  to     the
ground           service.              At page 89E concerning the                    availability              of
information                    as     to     the     number   of       people        passing           through
turnstiles                  the       officer       thought      if     he     had     requested              the
information                    from       the Control Room of the ground (I                       think        he
means the club control room) probably the number for turnstiles
1     to        8,         a number for 9 to 16 and a number of A-G.                                 He      said
normally              he       would        ask for the total number of visiting                            fans,
that is a facility he has used it for in the past.                                             The officer
didn't           know whether it would be an immediate reply if he asked
for        say        the number in the west stand, the north stand or                                        the
Leppings Lane terraces.


To     further              questioning at 89F and G related to                            a     conclusion
that        a        great          many     more     had gone        through        the       west         stand
turnstiles                 than       should        have   done.       The     officer           said       that
turnstiles                 1        - 10 were used for thenorth stand and 9 and                                10
would           be         included in the west stand total, so they should                                    be
subtracted                 from       the west stand total and added to                          the        north
stand           and the conclusion at page 89H was that we may not                                           have
got        more        in that we should have done (into the                               west        stand).
The        officer did not in fact ask for the figures.                                        He relied on
what        he could see.                   At page 90D the witness recalled a message
from        Superintendent Marhshall saying "we have got to open                                              the
gates     at     Leppings Lane" and the witness agreed that he was                                     a
pains     to     stress          that his request was for the                    gates        in     the
plural to be opened.


At     page 90 before the instruction was given to open the                                        gates
this     witness          received        in     the control        box     a        request        from
Inspector        Bennett          for     assistance at Leppings Lane                    and        then
Inspector        Sewell          came on the phone to say that he                       had        spare
serials        in the gymnasium and the witness sent these serials to
Inspector        Bennett and this occurred before the instruction was
given     to     open       the        gate.    There were         three        or    maybe         four
requests        received          to open the gate.              At page 9IE the              witness
says that he received two requests from Superintendent Marshall
to     open     the       gates,        two in quick        succession,              fairly     quick
succession        with a break.                Shortly after the second request                       PC
Bichard        who is the video operator said something to the effect
of     "the gate has gone" or "the gate has burst" and as I looked
at the video screen I could see that people were coming through
C     gate.      Then       the situation was recovered and the                          gate       was
closed.         After       that        there    were two more            requests        from        Mr
Marshall.


The     men     dispatched             from     the gymnasium would              have     gone        to
Leppings        Lane       end from the inside and would have been                             inside
the     turnstiles.              At     page     92C     concerning        particularly              the
closing off of the tunnel the witness was asked "was any attempt
made     to     pass       such        instructions on to           the     stewards?"               The
witness replied "no not that I know of.                            Certainly not from the
police        Control Room."             At page 92D the order was given to open
the     gates by Sergeant Goddard.                     The witness said he thought he
said     "officers          at        Leppings Lane open the              gates.         Open        the
gates."


It is plain from the evidence on page 92 that gate C was opened
for     a second time and then on request from a Sergeant                                     Higgins
who requested gate A to be opened and the witness was surprised
that      gate        A   was         still     closed     and     said     Mr        Duckenfield
immediately           said    open gate A.        The previous instructions            had
already gone through to open the gates.                     At that time was radio
was on talk through so that an officer behind gate A could have
heard     the earlier instruction to open gate A.                    At page 93        the
witness thinks just before kick off he saw behind the Liverpool
goal     one     of    the PCs opening the gate and             obviously       helping
someone        out.        Then the witness said that he could not                  recall
the     game     starting or anything about the players being on                       the
field.


The witness was not aware of the influx of spectators in pens 3
and 4 when the gates were opened but the officer said he didn't
see     any     particular        movement or anything that           gave him         any
concern        at all.       When the gates were opened this witness never
gave consideration as to where they were all going to go.                             This
officer        said that he knows the ground, knows where the                       tunnel
is,     knows     where        gate     C    is but   had   never    drawn sort         of
realisation           that people coming through gate C would go towards
the     tunnel        or     whatever       and   the two   things    just did         not
register,        did not tie up.            He said it seemed so obvious             after
the event but certainly I gave it no thought and no realisation
before.


At     page 94 the evidence returns to the opening of the gate                          in
the     perimeter fence to the track which the officer guessed                          as
being to pen number 3 and thought that four or five people were
let     out and they tended to drift down towards the corner which
is     the south side and there was a police woman.                    This    witness
had     at     that time stopped looking at the gate which                    had     been
opened and does not know whether it was closed again because he
was     watching the four or five down by the police woman and                          he
was     impatient that she should take these people off the                          track
and rehouse them.

Afternoon session - page 94
Continuation             of the examination of the witness B.D. Murray                      by
Mr Phillips.


(Throughout             with this witness I have endeavoured to leave                      out
reference to his evidence which is contained elsewhere and only
draw     attention to what I consider to be matters of                        importance
and     to       aspects     of     the evidence which     has    not     been           heard
before).


The     police woman was a PC Richardson and she had not                           appeared
to be aware of these people who had released from the other pen
and     so at page 94G Chief Inspector MacRobbie who was in                              plain
clothes went down to give her a hand and draw attention to what
was happening and help her put these people in the pen and they
were put into pen 1.


At     page       95     the witness gives evidence that there                were        then
quite        a    number of people getting out onto the track and                         they
appeared          just     to     be standing behind the      goal      watching           the
proceedings.              They     were    not   going anywhere    and        they        were
certainly          not     going to sort out of run on the field and                      stop
the     play       but they were standing around watching the                      game     on
the     track.          The witness' impression was that this was a minute
or     two       past     kick off.       There did not appear to        be        anything
particularly             wrong with the people on the track coming out                      of
pens     3       and     4, the pen didn't seem to be overcrowded                   and     at
page     95G       the     witness        said that the   first   time        he     became
concerned          about     the     people in pens 3 and 4 was when                he     got
down     to       the pitch.        He initially went down to stop             the game
but     Superintendent             Greenwood beat this witness to it to                   stop
the     game and so he had returned to the Control Room but                              after
about        half a minute or a minute Mr Duckenfield asked him to go
down     and clear the people off the pitch and move them                           towards
the     wings        and he went down on to the pitch, looked                 for        some
officers        who       I    could     use for this task and then        as        I    was
looking        around I could see that people were dazed, people were
injured,        people were sitting around, obviously in some sort of
distress.            As he approached the goals he could see that                    there
were     lots        of    police officers by then around          the     gates,          he
could     not        see the gates just the police officers and then                       he
saw the people against the fence.                  This at page 96.


The     officer           said   that     from   the control     room    it     is       very
difficult to see across the front of the pen because the                                 rail
obstructs the view.


At     page 97 it was Superintendent Greenwood who gave the signal
to the Control Room to stop the match and there may have been a
radio     message received by Sergeant Goddard as I heard him                             say
over     the radio "stop the game.               Stop the game."        At that          time
they     were        operating         purely from hand   held    personal        radios
because        the        radio operator had disturbed everything (I think
the     witness           was referring to the communications man               who       had
come to repair the radio).


At     page 97H the witness explained the position in relation                             to
the     radio.       He said in the Control Room we had two radios, one
as     a back up in case the main one goes down.                  It was the             main
radio     that went down.              The engineer tried to repair it and                 he
could     not do so, so he then connected us to the stand-by                             set.
Now,     the     loudspeaker           is on the desk in front      of    the        three
controllers.              That    is    the desk mounted loudspeaker          for         the
radios.        When we turned to the secondary set, that loudspeaker
was not in use.               The speaker is actually in the radio set which
is     under the desk and cannot be moved.                (There are     photographs
of this radio set up in photographs "West Midlands" towards the
end of the thick bundle 48 and 50).


The    witness also said that the stand-by radio is not used with
the standing microphone but with a telephone hand set mike.                               At
page     99A       the witness says that the controller could           not       use
that (presumably the hand set mike) because he could not get it
up to the desk. He said he could not get it up to thedesk                         and
was working off a personal radio.


At     page     99B     the witness     says that    although   he    had     said
communications          were   restored they were not restored with               the
equipment that they should have had.                They were restored in the
talk     through mode and the only means of communication they had
or     were     utilising was by way of a hand held         personal        radio,
which     was      exactly the same as every other officer who              had     a
radio.        There    was one stand-by personal radio in the            Control
Room     and this officer had his own that he had brought with him
in     his coat pocket.        They had those two.      The witness used one
and Sergeant Goddard used one.


Due to what has now become clear was a continuing radio problem
notwithstanding the evidence seen so far.               This witness says he
heard     nothing       from   the perimeter track at all       but     Sergeant
Goddard       must have heard something because he was either asking
or     shouting       "stop the game.    Stop the game."     At page     99G      it
was     put to the witness that all the officers on the               perimeter
track     were issued with radios but the witness said "not all of
them no sir".         It was then put to the witness that according to
the     operational       order   that was intended was it not          and    the
witness       answered     certainly the community constables who             work
that duty all the time carry their own radios.


It     became clear why Sergeant Goddard had heard the request                    to
stop     the game and why this witness had not when at page 100 he
says Sergeant Goddard was holding the radio to his ear and this
witness' was stood on the desk.


This witness thought that the request               to stop the game wasmade
because       of    the amount of people who        were spilling on     tothe
pitch     and the       goal mouth.   His perception was not that it           was
as a result of         what was going on inside pen 3. At        page    101 the
witness           says        that     after   the   game   had    been     stopped        he
immediately             went to the Control Room and then returned to                     the
pitch     as requested by Mr Duckenfield and as he was leaving the
Control        Room he remembers PC Bichard asked for an ambulance or
a     couple       of ambulances to be on standby.                When he got to          the
pitch     he could see the people distressed against the fence who
were     obviously             injured and there were obviously many of                  them
and one           ambulance           or   two ambulances were not        going     to     be
enough.


The witness did not have a radio, his radio was on the desk and
he     wanted ambulances so he approached a Sergeant and took                             his
radio     off          him, called Control Room and he             was    acknowledged.
The     witness asked                for a fleet of ambulances. The witness could
see     at     the back of the Leppings Lane stand                 that people        were
just     standing there looking out on the field as though nothing
was     happening.             The     witness had realised        that people        were
jammed       against          the      fence, that officers       were    having     great
difficulty             in getting them out of the gates and that the                     only
relief       would be if people would move back.                   The witness       asked
for    tanoy messages to be sent to tell people to move back                             and
thinks       that        he asked for a cutting equipment for the                  fences.
The    witness said that if he did not ask for cutting                        equipment
then somebody in his immediate vicinity did but he thought                                it
was him.


The witness did not recall hearing those tanoy messages played.


The    witness noticed that the people were still standing                          there
and     there          was     still       no movement and he     asked for       further
messages          to     be    passed and to keep passing messages             to     tell
people       to        move back but while he stood there he could see                    no
movement at all at the back of those pens.


The    witness           could       still not recall having        heard    any    tanoy
messages          but he does not know whether he would have heard them
on the field of play in any event.
The     witness           thought his first request for messages                       was     very
quickly         after           he had got onto the pitch about seven                    minutes
past three shortly after the game had been stopped.                                His second
request was made one or two minutes later.


He     said the fence was getting quite thick with police officers
helping        people           out     of the pens helping them over              and        other
officers were giving mouth                       to mouthand helping people.


The     witness           did     not see        at that stage     any     police        officers
coming into the pens from the rear, from the tunnel.


The     witness went down to the back and got round to the                                   tunnel
up     the south stand and straight through the gates and                                further
over     by     the side of the control room, round the back                             of     the
concourse           and        into     the     tunnel.   When he got          there     in     the
concourse           at        the back and when he got into the                tunnel         there
were     quite a few people there probably no more than fifty                                   and
there     were           some police officers, an Inspector.                     They        seemed
just     to be sort of hanging around not doing anything.                               At page
103A     the        witness           says "I can recall sort of           clearing           those
people        out        of     the tunnel with the police             officers         and     the
Inspector           said        somethingto       me.      I    cannot     remember          which
Inspector           it    was or what            he said. He    said something          to     the
effect       that         "we have got them all out now and they                    were        all
drunk" and I think he meant the people that were in the tunnel.
I     can't recall whether I got to the fence. I didn't go down to
the     perimeter              fence.         I can't recall whether I went             to     the
terrace and looked down."


At    page      103D          this      officer     says that     he     has    reached        the
situation at this point where he can't remember and he does not
know whether his recall is from what he saw or what he had seen
on video and he is very confused on the point.


The    witness went back to the pitch at about twenty past                                   three
and     he knew that Mr Greenwood was down there looking after the
rescue        attempt and recalls at 103F that some of the fans                   were
getting        agitated and noisy, were sort of threatening the Notts
Forest        supporters,        were shouting what a shitty ground it                was
and     it was a little bit ugly.             This witness dealt with one              or
two incidents he came across himself.                 There was a chap who was
hopelessly           drunk     who    climbed onto the goal     post.      Officers
pulled        him     down     andthe crowd reacted angrily.       I     told     the
officers        to let him go and not arrest him just send him on his
way.


This     witness at page 104 then             noticed that there was quite              a
few officers deployed along the               perimeter at the Kop and also a
large        number along the perimeter at the north stand but                   there
was     noone        on the south stand and this is where he            could         see
they     might have a problem and they had enough problems without
people        fighting        on the pitch or on the terraces.          He went       to
the     north        stand     and took one serial from there       and        told     a
Sergeant        Dyson to go across to the south stand and to                   prevent
the sort of problems that he had been referring to.


On     page     104 at twenty         five past three or thereabouts       he      was
approached           by a senior      fire officer who asked if he could make
some     arrangements for people to be taken out through the south
stand adjacent to the Control Room.                 The fire service wanted me
to     clear     a path on the west end of the south stand                to     allow
people        casualties        to be taken out in that       direction.         There
were about three police officers in that location and when some
of     the     fans        saw what was happening    they     volunteered        their
services        and        agreed to keep the area clear and the          area     was
cleared        and    a      number   of casualties were taken out         in     that
direction.            In     addition   a lot of people     were   being        taken
towards the gymnasium injured and some were being taken towards
the     tunnel.       The witness didn't see any going out between                 the
control box and the south stand but he believed some were taken
out that way.
The     officer went then back to the control cabin at about                             half
past     three.         He spoke to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.                      He
saw     ambulances behind the Control Room, behind the south stand
on     the     south        stand road.      When the witness     arrived           in    the
Control Room Mr Duckenfield and                     Assistant     Chief        Constable
Jackson were in the control box.


At     that time there were already a lot of officers coming                             into
the     ground from off duty a lot of arrangements had been put in
hand     and officers were coming from all over the force and some
were     offered from Humberside and accepted.                  One of the           senior
fire     officers           said he would like the ambulances to               be    taken
round        to      Penniston       Road,    the   gymnasium    side,     where          the
casualties           were        going to be taken out and all the         ambulances
were then taken round to that location.


There were then visits from the team managers and later on this
witness made an announcement over the public address system and
by and large that was complied with and was received very we l l .


The witness B.D. Murray was then cross-examined by Ben Hytner.


From page 105 through to 107 there is fencing between Mr Hytner
and     this        witness in respect of the filling of pens,                 what        is
overfull          and   what       is a matter of concern without          any       clear
answers        being        established but at 107D after a         suggestion            by
Hytner       that       overcrowding leads to danger of crushing and                     the
witness        responding          that it is not just overcrowding but                  also
behaviour and the way that people react leading to the question
"in     that case whose responsibility did you understand it to be
to     monitor the numbers going into each section of the Leppings
Lane     terraces           or    into the terrace as a whole?           The    witness
answered          "I think it is both the responsibility of the                     police
officers        and the stewards who were there to monitor and report
any concern."


So     far     as    the police are concerned this          would        embrace         the
police in the police Control Room who have a view of the police
monitors,        the      police       or the police presence          in     the      club's
control        room who have a larger number of monitors to look                           at,
the     police on the perimeter fencing and the police in the west
stand        and any police officer who sees a problem was                       something
that he identifies as a problem.                    At page 108B the witness says
that     the     police bodies referred to have a                responsibility             to
monitor        the     numbers going into any particular section of                        the
ground        for overcrowding by their visual awareness and                        further
that     the stewards have the same responsibility.                      Continuing on
page 108 there is discussion of the mathematical calculation of
how     many people could be got in and Hytner makes a point                              that
Mr     Marshall        request having been an unusual one it would                        have
been     better, crucial for either Mr Marshall to have asked                              for
or the witness to have volunteered the state of play within the
ground        itself      because       Mr Marshall would not          know      how     many
people        were     already in the ground and the witness                  said        that
that was correct.               But it had not been done by either of them.


The     witness        accepted        that    the plan    had   not     foreseen          the
situation arising at the turnstiles at Leppings Lane.


There        is further fencing up to page 110 and at 110E the                           Judge
suggested that perhaps it is not proper to explore every aspect
of     the    matter       with        every     officer   and   the Judge          further
suggested       that he did not think this officer was in a position
to know what              the     orders were that were given            down       on    the
concourse.


Hytner       responded          that    the witness, as it       were,      in      overall
control and said he was certainly not going to investigate this
with every officer.


They     continued questioning about the numbers of people and the
possibility          of    them        getting     into the ground and         what       the
criteria       should      be      for the delay of kick off and               there       is
reference       to what this witness said in his statement at page 9
concerning        delaying kick off and the Judge at 113D set out the
police        thinking     on   delaying the kick off as "I       suppose      the
thinking        behind it is this, that people who are held up by fog
or     an accident won't take the delay of kick off to be helf                  up
by fog or an accident next time, because that is just something
that     happened to them, but if people stay in the public houses
until     the last minute and roll up then and know that last time
it     happened      the    kick   off was delayed, then they         would     be
encouraged to doit more" and the witness said              "yes       my    lord,
exactly".


This     allowed the further evidence to be pursued by Hytner                  and
at     page     114 relating to the requests made by Mr Marshall               for
the gates to be opened.


Cross     examination by Mr Hytner finished at page 115 and few if
any points were made save that which I have identified here.


The witness Murray was then cross-examined by Mr Jackson.


The     witness      said that no briefing was given before           the     game
with     particular attention paid to crushing.           The witness         said
that     it was not mentioned in his brief.           From the video it was
clear     that well after ten past three many many police officers
were     standing        apparently doing nothing and it       was    suggested
that     this could have been because noone had ever briefed                them
as     to what they ought to do if there was a crush on the                 front
of anyone of those pens and the witness responded I think it is
posisible      because they did not realise the full extent of              what
was     happening.         They the witness further said that noone           was
briefed as to the method of extracting people from inside these
pens if there was a crush.


The     Judge asked of Counsel whether there is some specific                 way
of     doing    it   and     Jackson   responded   that   it   will    be     his
submission        that     anyone who had considered the possibility           of
crushing        at   the    Leppings     Lane   end   would have      instantly
realised        that       the gate in front was          pathetically       inadequate
and       theJudge responded "I don't think I am going to require a
lot     of persuasion about that".


At     page     117 Counsel takes the witness through the                    timing      of
what     occurred at the turnstiles and page 118 the witness                           says
with     hindsight          everything would be done differently and                   they
did not foresee any problems with those two central pens.


At page 118 the witness Murray is cross-examined by Mr Muller.


In     his cross-examination the witness was questioned concerning
thefilling of the pens of                      which three and four were a popular
part          ofthe ground and the witness said they generally fill up
at     the     back       with     gaps at the front and          accepted     that    the
natural        gangway into the adjoining pens at the back is blocked
but     the     fans do tend to find their way through the gates                       and
overspill        into       the        other    areas and at 118G     having     had    it
suggested        to him that people are strangers to that                    particular
ground the witness responded I don't think these Liverpool fans
very many of them were strangers.                      It is only a year that they
had been there before.


The witness Murray is cross-examined by Mr Maxwell                           commencing
at page 120.


Mr    Maxwell        put     it        to the witness that it      was   the     general
responsibility             of the police and the club, by its stewards                  to
monitor       the     fans        that went into pens 3 and 4.           The     witness
responded       that        he thought it to be a general            responsibility.
With regard to fighting or drinking or disorderly behaviour the
witness       would        expect       the police officer to bring it           to    our
attention or          a     steward       to bring it    to   a    police      officer's
attention.           There        is    reference to a    pre-match      briefing       of
stewards       and        the witness the Inspector in charge of the                  four
stands       briefed the stewards working in those particular areas.
Inspector       White        would have briefed the stewards in                the    west
stand.        At        page        12IB   it was put to       this   witness        "was     any
arrangement              made        between    the    club    and    the      police       about
distribution             of stewards."          The witness said "not that I                 know
of,     no".        No arrangement about the location and the numbers of
stewards           as     far as he knew.         Further at 121C the witness                 was
asked        whether           it    was the situation where, in his              mind,       the
club     and        the        police      were making     separate      and     independant
arrangements             for        managing the crowd that came.              The     witness
replied        the       senior police officer, like I say,                 in respect         of
each     stand briefed the stewards working in that area.


The      witness was then cross-examined by Mr Gibson-Watt.                             It was
established             that this witness was not in the Control Room when
Mr Kelly,            the Chief Executive of the FA visited                     the     Control
Room.


The     witness was cross-examined by Mr Kallipetis.                           At page        123
it     was     established             that there is no facility in             the     police
Control        Room whereby the can see the pictures available to the
club     video          cameras throughout the ground.                The police        cannot
monitor        the        field site cameras at all.             The only facility             is
that there              is     an officer in the Control Room, a                PC     with     a
radio.


The witness Murray is cross-examined by                         Mr Glasgow when on page
123      it was established that one of the monitors in the club's
Control         Room          monitors      whatever     the    police      happen      to    be
recording          at that time.            But there is no facility whereby                 the
club     can       switch from one camera to another.                    But at page          124
with     that        exception the club's cameras are trained                     on       their
turnstile          staff        watching       the flow into the         ground      and     the
police       cameras are trained all around the ground including the
inside as well.                The witness agreed that downstairs in the club
room     under          the     stand they do not have           cameras       viewing       the
inside of the ground, on the stands or the terraces, unless one
of the police cameras happens to be showing on the monitor.
At     page 124D Mr Glasgow asked the witness whether he was aware
that regular          calls were being made from the police Control                Room
down     to     the club control room in           order to find out       what     the
turnstile entry figures were and Mr Glasgow could only help the
officer        by     telling        him that the calls were usually made            to
Police Constable Guest who is the police liaison officer within
the club's room.             The officer accepted that that was what ought
to be done.


The    witness         accepted      that the police have a       police     liaison
officer         largely       for    the     purpose   of    telling the         police
operations           room what information is being gathered within                the
club's        room    and     at      page    125D it was put    to the      witness
expressly       that        either    Police     Constable    Guest   or    Mr    Lock
responded       and     gave         the police control box those           figures        at
regular occasions during the afternoon.


The    witness         said he did not        know anything about that at         a l l.
At     125E thewitness accepted               that all that he could confirm is
that     that was the system that ought to have been operated                      and
he was doubtless relieved to hear that it did.

Mr B.D. Murray cross-examination by Mr Glasgow continued.


At 127C and D there is reference by Mr Glasgow to the                     planning
document           for the match and the witness agrees that there is a
conspicuous          absence    of   any   reference   to   stewards       on    the
terraces           and further the     witness agreed that     there       is     no
suggestion          that    police   in the stand are there     to     help      the
stewards.


On     the same page the witness goes on to say that he would                    not
expect        to    find    stewards actually on the terraces        at     league
games.


Mr     Glasgow's remaining questions related to the opening of the
gates        and at page 3 IB the witness said that his perseption was
that all           the gates at Leppings Lane would be opened          when       Mr
Duckenfield gave the authority.


That        completed the cross-examination of the witness Mr              Murray
by     Mr    Glasgow       and the Judge then informed the      enquiry         that
members       of the enquiry would inspect the police box at quarter
to     nine the next day, the enquiry was adjourned until                  10.30am
the following morning.

Witness B.D. Murray recalled and cross-examined by Mr Woodwood.


At     page     6F and G the witness says at the time the main                                  radio
set     was     down     and        the Control Room        were        reduced       to        using
personal        hand     sets and competing for air time with                         everybody
else.         They     did        have a personal radio link with                   the        club's
operations           room which was a separate personal radio system run
by     the     club which was the one the club used to contact                                  their
stewards        and their officials and the police had the capability
of     contacting the club's operations room on that radio                                     system
plus     a     telephone link on the club's private network.                               In        the
club's room there was PC Guest.


On     page     7B     the        witness    said that      PC        Guest   was         able        to
communicate with police Control Room from the club's operations
room     and        if anybody in the club had wanted to                      see     something
through        the     police        cameras they could have asked for                         it     by
radio or telephone but the witness Murray had never known it to
be     requested.            At     page 7E in response to a question                      by        the
Judge        the witness told the enquiry that when he was trying                                     to
get     through to Mr Lock he tried to do it on the club's                                     radio.
He called two or three times over a period of possibly a minute
and he does not why there was no response.


On     page     8    there is reference to the club's                     computer             and     a
warning        given by the computer when the ground has reached                                     15%
off being full the witness says that he would expect to be told
upon         that     level        being    reached   but        he     received          no        such
communication on that day.                   This at page 8F.


Page     8G in response to the Judge on the same point the witness
says     that all it would have told him (the 15% sign) would have
been     an indication of how many people were to come in and                                        how
many     people        were outside.   At page 9C in further response     to
a question by the Judge the witness agreed that in fact what he
had     instead was completely bypassing the turnstile system            and
letting in a large number through the gate.


At     page    10D the witness said that it was his impression          that
the     club was well aware of what was going on in its ground and
how the crowds were coming in.


At     page    15 Mr Woodwood finished his cross-examination of          the
witness       Murray.       At page 19 in response to questions   by     the
Judge     this witness said that he had no idea why there are            two
rejections        of     brickwork out on to the terrace blinkering      the
view     of    the gates between the pens but the officer had          never
noticed       that before.      At page 19F a conclusion was drawn      that
the     brickwork was there to stop people falling off the ends of
those higher terraces.


The evidence of Mr Murray was completed at page 19.

Volume 4 of DAC bundle of transcripts

Morning session - page 20
Superintendent Roger L. Greenwood was called and examined by Mr
Goldsack.


Superintendent           Roger   Greenwood       is     presently     Sub-Divisional
Commander         for      Woodseats      Sub-Division        and     has     been     a
Superintendent since May 1986.               He has experience in F Division
covering         Hillsborough       and   with        other   football      crowds    at
Rotherham United.


This     year     he was ground commander and the year before he                     had
the     Leppings Lane end.          In 1987 he also had responsibility for
the     Leppings Lane end.          This witness had been an Inspector                at
the     time     of     the crushing incident at Tottenham               Hotspur     and
Wolverhampton           Wanderers    in   1981 and the        debriefing        meeting
after the 11th April 1981 match was considered.


At     page 23G the witness Greenwood is referred to tab H of                        the
same     bundle of documents (I think the 1981 debriefing) and                        at
23G there is a paragraph "we should stress to the stewards that
the admission of spectators and the packing of those spectators
at     the     bigger     games on to the terracing is              primarily      their
function        and not a police one.         It was put to the witness              but
the     witness had no recollection that the document was going to
be     passed by Mr Kelvert to the stewards at the club.                     This     at
page 24A.


At     page 35F the witness refers to the jutting out walls on the
terraces        and he says - that is something that has been brought
to my attention now but I have not seen before as a problem.


The    witness Greenwood's evidence finishes on page 44 and apart
from the evidence I have drawn attention to here I do not think
that     he gave any evidence that added to that which has already
been stated here.


At page         44    the witness Greenwood was        cross-examined         by     Mr
Hytner.


At     page     50E    and F in his endeavours to reconstruct            how        the
tragedy        occured this witness Greenwood mentions have gone back
to     the     ground the following day and saw the barrier.              It       was
the     only     barrier      in    that crowd that    seemed     to   have        been
affected        by    the crowd.      I didn't see any other barriers              that
were     bent.        (This    is    the   only   reference     throughout         this
witness'        evidence      so    far that might relate remotely        to        the
club and all his other evidence has been covered previously).


At page 50 the enquiry adjourned for lunch.

Witness R.L.          Greenwood recalled cross-examined by        Mr     Hytner
continued.


Mr     Hytner's cross-examination continues to page 60 and nothing
in     his questions or the answers he obtained in my opinion                 add
anything       to    the evidence which has already been      referred         to
here.


Mr Hytner's examination at page 60.


The witness Greenwood is then cross-examined by Mr Jackson.


At page 62E the witness considering the safety of the pitch and
considering the perimeter fence to the pitch said "as I look at
the situation now, the only way that I would remove that fence,
if you wish, would be if the terracing was at the same level as
the pitch."


Mr      Jackson's      cross-examination   finishes   at   page     63        and
otherwise adds nothing to the previous evidence heard.


At     page    63    the   witness Greenwood is   cross-examined         by    Mr
Muller.       At    page   68B the officer Greenwood in the       course       of
being     cross-examined as to his activities at the gate to pen 3
where     he was directing the extrication of injured through that
gateway       and saying that he was unaware of what was going on at
the     gate to pen 4 where he thought people were flowing               freely
through       that gate.     He said as he later discovered one of            the
big differences between gate 3 and gate 4 was that gate 3 had a
collapsed barrier very close to the gate.


The     cross-examination by Mr Muller of Mr Greenwood finishes at
page     69 and in my view apart from that which I have           mentioned
adds     nothing to the evidence which has already been                  mentioned
herein.


At     page     70    the    witness Greenwood is      cross-examined       by    Mr
Kallipetis.


This witness is asked by Mr Kallipetis questions in relation to
the positioning of ambulances and said that he did not give any
instructions as to where ambulances should attend.


The     cross-examination by Mr Kallipetis is completed at page 72
and     other    than       stated     here does not   add   anything      to    the
evidence already set out.


The witness Greenwood is then cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.


At     page 72 this witness is referred to volume 1 tab 5 relating
to     the    1981        incident and a copy of a letter written          to    the
Chairman        of the club apparently written by the Assistant Chief
Constable        and      there is reference to a very candid reply              from
the. Assistant Chief Constable or the Chief Constable.


The     sentence          I think in the debriefing document at page 3             of
tab     4 is recorded in the transcript "Mr Herold said that                     this
situation prompted the only criticism of the police by the club
in     that we seem to be helping fans to climb over the railings"
and at page 74G there appears an extract apparently in response
from the Chief Constable to the Chairman of the club at tab 5 a
letter 5th June 1981 quoting "in this respect my only criticism
of     my senior officers is for not opening the gate earlier thus
avoiding         the       emergency    measure   of   allowing    and      helping
spectators           to    climb over the fence".      At page 79G Mr       Glasgow
elicits       from        this witness the record from the        working       party
document        "the police representative confirmed that the revised
segregation           arrangements to the rear of the stand worked               well
on by far the majority of occasions" and that this reference in
fact was to the new layout of the turnstiles.
At     page 81H the officer gave evidence that prior to the                      match
he     had     no    qualms     or concern from   his     previous    experience
concerning          the     layout of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane              end
and he would have said so the year before had he had any                          such
qualms.


At page 82 this witness had no recollection of numbered tickets
being used. That is Counsel was referring to numbers 1, 2,                           3
or 4 in relation to the number of a pen.


Mr Glasgow's cross-examination of Mr Greenwood finished on page
83     and     except where pointed up in my view no useful                evidence
was obtained              that had not been elicited previously           elsewhere
herein.


At page 83            the witness Greenwood was         cross-examined       by    Mr
Woodwood.


At     page     89 Mr Collins having started to put questions to                  the
witness        in relation to what the goalkeeper Grobbelaar has said
in     his     statement      to the witness and the      witness     having       no
knowledge       as     to what was in that statement and Mr           Grobbelaar
not being available to give evidence the Judge with the consent
of     others       agreed that Mr Woodwood could read to           the     witness
Greenwood       parts of the Grobbelaar statement.            The reading          of
parts of this statement commences at page 90.


At     page 90F and G and page 91B the Grobbelaar statement refers
to     his awareness of the problems that fans were having in pens
3     and 4 immediately after Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar                     of
the     Nottingham         Forest   goal from a corner.     At page        91C    the
Grobbelaar          statement goes on to say "there were two              policemen
near     the    gate right alongside the fan who had shouted to                   him
and so Grobbelaar shouted to them 'get the gate open'" and when
Grobbelaar shouted             to the policemen again one went            over    and
opened a gat.
Mr   Woodwood        told the enquiry that Mr Beardsley's        failure     to
score    the     goal    occurred     at about four   minutes   past   three
according to the video cameras.


At   page      92F    and G the witness Greenwood       gives   evidence      of
having      himself     moved around the ground with his        loud   hailer
endeavouring to inform the fans what was happening and the fans
co-operated.


Mr   Woodwood's cross-examination of the witness Greenwood                  ends
on page 95.


At page 95 Mr Greenwood is re-examined by Mr Collins.


No     points arise in re-examination of the witness Greenwood                by
Mr Collins appear to me to warrant being mentioned here and his
re-examination          finishes at page 97.    At page 98 the Judge puts
some     questions      to   the    witness   which   was   followed   by     Mr
Kallipetis       with the Judge's permission further cross-examining
Mr Greenwood and the evidence of Mr Greenwood concludes on page

Thursday 1st June 1989
Afternoon session - page 101
Chief Superintendent John Arthur Nesbit was called and examined
by Mr Collins.


John     Arthur Nesbit is Divisional Commander for operations                                     and
traffic        and        was OC the traffic side of the                 operation          order.
This witness had no problems on the traffic side and arrived at
the     ground           shortly       after     3.00pm and      went     in       through        the
entrance        that leads to the back of the north stand at the                                  Kop
end.      He       was informed by Inspector Sewell that the                             game     had
been     stopped and the there were problems at the Leppings                                     Lane
terracing,           there       was an evacuation going on and                    people        were
believed        to        have       been injured.        He arrived on the              pitch     at
approximately              10    or 12 minutes past three and when he got                          to
the     end     (presumably                Leppings Lane end) he was aware                 of     the
horrifying pile of bodies as seen on the video.


This     officer           took charge of the evacuation of the                      pens.        At
page     105H this witness confirms to Counsel that he had himself
in     the past had some experience of the affect of a barrier, in
that     case        a    wall, collapsing with a large on                     a    terrace       at
Millmoor        football             ground.         At page 106B the      witness         Nesbit
goes     on to describe what occurred at Millmoor football                                 ground
collapse        of       the     wall was at direct level               with       the    playing
surface       as         opposed to the well or sump that they have on                           the
terracing at Wednesday ground and then at page 106E (IMPORTANT)
the     witness said "in my opinion what has probably happened                                    at
Hillsborough             was     that        again     because of   the        crash      barrier
breaking, the people being surged forward, they were hitting an
immovable          object,           the     perimeter fence, plus the well                and     I
think     people          fell        into     the    well,   people      were       catapulted
probably           over        the     top,     hit    the    fencing     and      came         down
unfortunately on the top of the people who were at the front".
At page 106F the witness agreed with Counsel put to him "so you
had the combination of the breaking of the barrier and the well
or sump and the perimeter fence all added together to make                                         a
fatal situation".


The     examination         by     Mr     Collins      of     the    witness        Nesbit        is
completed at page 106.


The     witness        Nesbit      was then cross-examined              by     Mr     Woodwood
commencing on page 106.


At     page        108D in response to the Judge's question                     "would           you
subscribe           to the view that if you had had some effective                             wire
cutting        material, machinery, it would not have been any                                 use?"
The     witness        answered "no I don't say that my lord.                         I        think
that if we had extra gates or the gates had been bigger I think
there        would have been more facilities for lateral movement                                 on
the terracing.             I think police officers could probably have got
in     to move people laterally as opposed to trying to move                                    them
back.        I think that if we had got the fencing down quicker I am
sure          it       would       have        been    better.          Mr       Woodwood's
cross-examination              ended      on    page    108    whereafter           the        Judge
questioned           the   witness further at page 109A in response to                             a
question by the Judge the witness gave the opinion that "if the
level of the terracing had been at the same level as the bottom
of     the fencing, I think peoples perception of what was                                 taking
place        would have been that much more apparent, because when                                 I
arrived        at Leppings Lane it was not until you got within                                 feet
of     the     perimeter fencing that you were aware of                        the        problem
that was taking place in the well below pitch level.


Further        in     answer     to a question by the               Judge    this         witness
states        at    page     HOB        "because of the securing             bars         on    the
Leppings           Lane entrance, the gates (the gates in the                        perimeter
fence        to the pitch) only go back at right angles which, again,
are restrictive." This ends the evidence of the witness Nesbit.

Witness Superintendent John Harris Brougham called and examined
by Mr Collins.


The witness Superintendent John Harris Brougham is stationed at
Rotherham       in   charge of the Road Traffic Department.    It    was
this officer's duty on the day in question to oversee, under Mr
Nesbit,    the traffic side of the operation.      The force of     this
witness'       evidence   is at page 111C when he states that was     no
significant arrival of vehicular traffic after twenty past two.


The examination in chief of Mr Brougham by           Mr   Collins    was
completed on page 111.


He was cross-examined by Mr Hytner at page 111.


Mr    Hytner established that there was heavy pedestrian       traffic
along Leppings Lane at about 14.44 to 14.46.


Mr Hytner completed his cross-examination on page 111.


At    page 112 the witness was cross-examined by Mr Woodwood         and
the    force    of the witness' evidence was the traffic flow       this
year was a very successful operation.


The   witness Brougham was re-examined by Mr Collins at page 112
and   established that this offer heard the message requesting a
public address system in Clay Wheels Lane at about 14.44.


The evidence of this witness was concluded at page 112.

Witness   Detective Superintendent                    Graham    McKay     called           and
examined by Mr Collins.


Detective           Superintendent        Graham    McKay both in the          match        in
1988     and 1989 was responsible for overseeing the crime side in
relation to pickpockets and motor vehicle crime — breaking into
cars and stealing.


This officer does not normally attend football matches and had
not attended a match since the 1988 semi-final.


This     witness        gave evidence that as ten to three there                     was     a
huge     build-up of Liverpool supporters who had been drinking at
the     Leppings        Lane turnstiles and he said by then the                     orderly
crowd     had gone in but by and large the ten to three crowd                              had
taken     a     lot of drink on board and they were in                such          numbers
that     excluding them from the ground was completely out of                              the
question.  This    at page 113G     (I now                     realise        that       this
proceeding evidence relates to 1988).


At page 114 this officer says that at 2.30 there was much worst
congestion this year that the year before at the Leppings Lane
end. This at the    turnstiles.


Page     116B there is reference by this officer to the                       fact that
the A-G turnstiles did not seem to be operating properly but he
says "the turnstiles are geared to accept one person at a time,
and     when        people are     pressed up       at theturnstiles          in         such
numbers        it     appeared     that    the     people   wishing      to        use   the
turnstiles did not have freedom to get in properly.


At     page     118    this      officer with Inspector        Beal      set       up    the
temporary       mortuary in the gymnasium and both dead and                         injured
arrived in the gymnasium.


There was some chaos in the gymnasium with fights breaking out
in and amongst and over the bodies.


The   examination of this witness Mr McKay was completed at page
120 and    the   enquiry adjourned until   10.00am   the   following
morning.

Witness G McKay recalledand               cross-examined by Mr Hytner.


All     this evidence went to what occurred in the gymnasium being
used     as     a temporary mortuary, to the early chaotic                   situation
and     the     establishment        of   some order out of      chaos        and     the
procedures             established        to   identify       deceased.              This
cross-examination by Mr Hytner finishes at page 8.


Page 8 again the witness McKay is cross-examined by Mr Jackson.
At     page     8G it is put to this witness that it was apparent                      to
him      in     1989     that theflow through the       turnstiles           was     less
efficient than the year before.


The     witness said that in 1988 the efficiency of the turnstiles
was temporarily reduced for a small period because of drunks as
he     had     previously given evidence and then at page                E     dealing
with 1989 and the efficiency of the turnstiles he said that his
perception was that the turnstiles were not working efficiently
because of the pressure upon them.               At page 10H Mr Jackson told
the     Judge that the enquiry was going to hear from officers who
were     stopping       and searching and we may have to           consider           the
flows        through     for that reason but that is at a          later           stage.
The cross-examination by Mr Jackson completed at page 12.


Mr Maxwell had no questions for this witness.


The          witness     at   page 12 was      then   cross    examined        by     Mr
Kallipetis.


MrKallipetis' questions to                the witness related to         ambulances
and      added     nothing     tothe evidence already set out in                   these
notes.
At    page 14 Mr Woodwood commenced his cross-examination of        the
witness McKay.


Mr    Woodwood's cross-examination Qf the witness McKay        finishes
at    page 21 but adds nothing to the evidence in my opinion.


At    page   21   the witness McKay is re-examined   by   Mr   Collins
which added nothing to the evidence in my view.


The    Judge then put one or two questions to the witness and his
evidence is completed on page 22.

Friday 2nd June 1989
Morning session - page 22
Witness        Inspector     Paul Hand-Davis called and examined             by    Mr
Phillips.


The      witness     Paul        Hand-Davies   is   Inspector    of   the     South
Yorkshire        Police     in    charge of the mounted section        which        is
based        at two stables one at Sheffield and one at Barnsley.                   He
was     in     charge of the mounted operation at the match             on        15th
April.


This     officer has vast experience of policing football                   matches
pretty well every Saturday over a period of 11 years and became
in charge of the mounted section at Sheffield in October 1986.


He     has    wide   experience        of   Hillsborough   and    policed         both
semi-finals there.


This     officer's        observation was that over the last          couple        of
years        there has been a tendency for people to come much                   later
to the grounds.


The     witness      later clarifies his attendance at semi-finals                  as
Hillsborough and, in fact, attended in 1987, 1988 and 1989.


This     officer's experience was such that by quarter of an                      hour
before        kick off there is normally very little for his officers
to     do and he normally planned to stand them down at that                      time
for them to go back to base.


The     officer's intention was not to stand down all his                   mounted
force        at this time but he would normally stand down one                   dozen
of his "foreign force colleagues".


The     officer      said that things quietened down as usual               at     the
Penniston           Road end and mounted officers could have stood                   down
at quarter to or ten to and the previous year that had been the
situation           at     Leppings Lane end and in fact the previous                year
mounted forces, or some of them were stood down at the Leppings
Lane end.


This     officer          depolyed      Merseyside    mounted    officers      to        the
Liverpool side of the ground and Nottingham mounted officers at
the other end of the ground and the approaches to that end.


There were 36 mounted police on duty overall.


There        were 29 horses deployed on the ground on the day of                         the
1989     match,           30    were intended but one horse was lame,              and     6
deployed at Midland railway station (Wadsley Bridge Station).


This     officer gives details of what he did during the day                         from
about        11.30am           onwards, moving around the area of       the        ground
and,     carnival              atmosphere,    meeting a nice group of        400     lads
arriving           off     the train at about 2.00pm.         The people      off        the
train        were escorted to the ground by 8 mounted police and they
arrived        at        the ground at about 14.08 and they          went     straight
through        the        turnstiles     at    Leppings Lane and     there    was         no
problem.


There        were        five mounted officers at the Leppings Lane                ground
perimeter and turnstiles and no problems were reported.


It     was     a         normal Saturday afternoon semi-final         situation          up
until half past two.


There        was then a huge influx of late arrivals.                They came from
all     directions.              For every two thirds that came down          Leppings
Lane     equally          a third of that was coming down from              Middlewood
traffic        lights           - 2 to 1 down Leppings Lane as against             coming
down     from        Middlewood Road. At page 31C the witness Hand-Davis
says     from            2.30pm     onwards there was a lot     of   confusion,          no
aggression,           there    were     signs of people who had had a                 lot     of
drink     and     a     lot of confused people.           Nobody seemed          to     know
where    they were going with tickets.               They had no idea at                al l .
They     had to ask policemen constantly "where is this entrance".
They had no idea of where to enter the ground.


The     officer       was      not concerned with pens 1-16           although          from
2.30pm onwards it was full or getting full but the A-G pen from
2.35pm        onwards        started to get quite crushed.           Two    merseyside
officers,        Constables Standbridge and Grunning were at the                            A-G
pen     and     had been working in and out of those                 enclosures             all
afternoon assisting with queuing.


The     officer        said there were more turnstiles at 1-16                   than        at
A-G.


This     witness went in amongst the people in front of turnstiles
A-G     talking        to     the   crowd,    shouting,     waving     my       arms        and
gesticulating,              pleading   with   them to      stop   pushing.             These
endeavours        did        not    have the slightest affect.             He    had        two
mounted officers behind him working together in this attempt.


The     officer describes the crowd at wrapping themselves                            around
him and around the horse like cellophane or cling-film.                               He had
never     experienced that before.              The horse could not move a leg
or a muscle.


The     horse was partially lifted off the ground involuntarily by
the     crowd.         The horse weighed anything from a half                   to     three
quarters of a ton.


At about 14,40 the officer made a request to ground control for
further mounted officers.


Further forces did arrive.


After 10 or 15 minutes this witness extricated himself from the
crush and got behind the crowd as did the other two officers in
there possibly a little later.


I managed to get the perimeter gates closed on two occasions.


Both gates were double gates.


The     first occasion when the gates were closed they were forced
open within a minute or two.


The second time mounted police succeeded in opening and closing
the     gates       they were forced open more or less as soon as           they
were closed.


Mounted        officers then got into a line in front of the gates on
the     road        side of the gate in their last attempt to hold          back
the crowd and the time would then have been about 14.50.


The officer was not aware of gate C being opened.


An     attempt was then made to form a complete line from one side
to     the     other and that started to work to some        extent.        This
lasted        for    two     or three minutes and there were five      or    six
hundred fans coming towards the ground.


People were then forcing themselves between the horses, hitting
the     horses, grabbing the reins, throwing themselves under                the
bellies        of    the horses to get to the other side of them.            The
officer        thought       that   drink and desparation was a   factor      in
their        behaviour.       The officer was aware of the Land Rover with
the     loud        hailer and could hear repeatedly "Liverpool        stands,
stop pushing".             The police were ignored.


The     officer was aware of a rush to gate C and he thought                that
gate     A opened more or less at the same time.           He saw hoards of
people running through gate A.
The     witness        was not aware and did not see the influx of                    fans
through gate C.


After     the        opening    of gate A the        crowds    disappeared       fairly
swiftly       but      people were still coining along Leppings Lane and
even     when the gates were shut again there was still a                       lot     of
people outside Leppings Lane they were still coining.


This officer then went to the police control room.


The     officer        had never witnesses crowd behaviour of that                    type
before and his perception was that the consumption of drink had
a lot to do with it.


This witness' evidence in chief ends at page 41.


At     page     42     the witness Hand-Davis is cross-examined                by     Mr
Hytner.


In     cross-examination this witness said that he would                       normally
try     to keep the Control Room informed and whenever he can pass
useful        information        to   Control. He has a radio          on     which     to
receive       message         from Control.     This officer did        not     receive
information           over the radio as what actions were being taken by
Mr     Marshall or others.            At page 45B the witness says that                the
trouble         was     not     caused    by   the    Police    or    the     turnstile
operators.            At page 45C the witness says that at half past two
onwards       the      turnstiles        and the police had      reached       breaking
point.        At page 47G this witness accepts that both the mounted
and     foot police in Leppings Lane had lost control of the crowd
and     permitted        it to fill the pen between the turnstiles                    area
and     the     perimeter        fence,     he said their      best    efforts        were
thwarted.


Cross-examination by Mr Hytner finishes at page 47.


The     witness is cross-examined by Mr Jackson commencing on page
In     this cross-examination the witness give evidence that it is
the     intention        of mounted police in respect of the                   supporters
coming by train to keep them in the crocodile and get them into
the ground.


Mr     Jackson's clients, the football supporters apparently oject
to this.


Cross-examination by Mr Jackson ends at page 50.


The    witness        Hand-Davis      is cross-examined    by        Mr        Kallipetis
commencing at page 50.


At     page     52B the witness says that on his way to                   the     Control
Room     he     saw     people    climbing over the     fence        and        instantly
reacted       to it thinking it was pitch invasion and ran                       straight
back to his horse.           He did not go into control.


In cross-examination the witness gives details of his movements
once his perception is that there has been a pitch invasion and
he     took     eight     horses up to gate 0 and       waited        instructions.
When     casualties started to appear near him he realised it                          was
not     a pitch invasion and he moved away from that area with his
mounted       police      and cleared off to give enough access                   to    the
ambulance service.


The cross-examination by Mr Kallipetis ends at page 55.


The      witness         Hand-Davis    cross-examination        by        Mr      Glasgow
commenced at page 55.             At page 55F the witness said that it was
not unusual for fans to be confused, they come to a ground once
or     twice a season, they don't know the access areas like we do
but     there     seemed     to    be an awful lot of     confusion              on    this
occasion, much more than usual.
The     officer              gave    evidence     of fans    asking      for     directions,
handing        their tickets up to him and the witness looking at the
ticket        and        pointing         them   to the batch     of     turnstiles          they
require.            At page 56B the officer says that he just sends fans
in     the right direction generally and then says "there is                                 even
confusion           as        to    which is the right       standing      enclosure            for
queuing        and which is the right sitting enclosure" so generally
speaking he would direct them one way or the other.


Questioned           about          the    marking   of the ground being          A,       C,     B
instead        of        A,    B, C.       The officer did not think       that this was
the     cause of the confusion.                   He thought drink was the cause of
the     confusion and the officer said that the A, C, B layout was
the     same        as it had been since 1986.               At page 57E the           witness
says     Hillborough                is    a fine ground - one of the best              I     have
policed        at        -     and       there is no particular        problem    with          the
Leppings Lane turnstiles as far as I am concerned.                              At page 57G
he     says     that the             mounted men outside but their         faith       in the
turnstile           operators and they (turnstile operators) had                        always
performed magnificantly up to then.


Page     61    completes the cross-examination of Hand-Davis                            by      Mr
Glasgow.


The cross-examination of this witness Hand-Davis by Mr Woodwood
commences on page 61.


Mr     Woodwood           questioned         the witness about his        previous         wide
experience.               He       took    the   witness    through     the     closing         of
Leppings       Lane            to traffic and generally through                evidence and
over areas which have been adequately covered by this and other
witnesses.


The cross-examination by Mr Woodwood is completed on page 68.


The witness Hand-Davis was re-examined by Mr Collins commencing
on page 68.
The     re-examination by Mr Collins ends at page 70 and does                              not
add anything to what has been previously been noted herein.


At     page     70        the witness is questioned by the            Judge.         He     is
questioned           by     the     Judge     about the method   of     using        police
horses,        using       the passive force of the animal, it is                a        very
gentle        animal       but its size makes people respect             it.         Police
horses        can    work crowds because people normally try to give                         a
horse     a     reasonable           berth.     On this occasion nobody         in        that
crowd     seemed          to be conscious of the police horses or               worried
about     them.           Dozens of people "dived" under the bellies of the
horses.         The people doing that and passing between the head of
one     horse        and the rear of another were doing it and were                        not
under pressure.


Mr     Glasgow told the Judge that the club's enquiries concerning
forgeries           only turned up one forged ticket.            It did not appear
that     the        enquiry was dealing with a large force of people                        in
possession of forged tickets.


The     enquiry        was        adjourned until 10.30am on Monday            5th    June
1989.
NHB30          Hillsborough
Volume 4 of the DAC bundle of transcripts
Monday 5th June 1989
Morning session - Page 1
Chief     Inspector Robert Wallace Creaser called and examined                             by
Mr Collins.


Before     proceeding          with this witness Mr Collins addressed                     the
Judge     to the effect that he had now effectively completed                             the
evidence        of the officers in charge of the operation and                          those
reponsible        for the planning and was now turning to a number of
officers        starting with Chief Inspector Creaser who were at the
ground,        some   at       the turnstiles, some inside           the        ground     in
order     to     give a cross section of the evidence                 such        officers
were     able to give.           It was Mr Collins' intention to limit                    the
evidence to relevant parts only.


(I     propose to further limit this officer's evidence so far                             as
this     mode of evidence is concerned to that which I consider to
be     additional        and    useful      above and beyond        that        which     has
already been noted here).


The     witness, Chief Inspector Robert Wallace Creaser is in                            the
Communications           and    Computer      Development     Department           and     is
familiar       with      the Hillsborough ground.           He is experienced              in
football matches.              He had responsibility directly to the Serial
Inspector        in   charge of the north stand, the west                   stand,       the
Leppings       Lane      terraces, the rear enclosure and                 the     Leppings
Lane     turnstiles.            Effectively     he   was    under     Superintendent
Greenwood        responsible for the Liverpool side of the ground and
turnstiles        both     inside     and     outside.      All     the     areas        just
confined to Liverpool supporters.


This     witness told the enquiry that officers are not considered
necessary        actually on the terraces.            There were no officers on
the     terraces.        At page 5C the witness says that he was present
when     Inspector White briefed the club stewards or at least                             he
entered          the stand when Inspector White was part way through                   a
briefing           to     the Sheffield Wednesday club stewards.            Later     at
page        5E he knew there were going to be no stewards and                     indeed
there were no stewards actually on the terraces.                          It did     not
surprise this officer in the least.


At     page 6 the officer gave evidence that the different                        factor
from        previous matches was the large build-up of fans coming so
much later ie. from 2.30 to 2.35 onwards.


The     witness           refers to fans who had taken sufficient drink               to
have        dutch        courage       or were fighting drunk.              three     or
four        pints but if an officer approached them and told them                     to
cool        it     they would.         This mood however gradually changed           and
those        arriving           at a quarter to three and ten to      three        there
was     a     much higher proportion of those who had               been     drinking
and     he thought they drunk more and were more unruly.                         Amongst
them        there        were also decent honest family men         arriving.         At
page        7B the witness describes supporters being confused                     about
which        turnstile           they should go to.     He is   continually        asked
for     turnstile           Z and      the witness' recall was that in fact          the
tickets          said gangway          Z.   The gangway U V W X Y Z in groups         of
three        and    were         to the west stand and a gangway      was        pointed
over     the        turnstile.         Some thought that they were looking           for
turnstile           Z.      At page 7D the witness says that he            thinks     it
would        have        been     of   some assistance if the     signs     had     been
larger.          They were not particularly clear.


On     page        7 there is further discussion about the            markings        on
tickets and markings on turnstiles causing confusion.


The     witness           says     that the A, C, B problem might         have     added
somewhat to the confusion.


the     witness          was aware that there were people without                tickets
and     that        there        were people selling tickets but      the        officer
estimated not more than 200 without tickets.                     This at page 9.
On     page 9 there is reference to this officer's statement                               that
the     mood        of     the crowd was changing from good             natured           to     a
frustrated           crowd        who thought they weren't going to get in                      at
the     start        of the match.         A proportion of spectators               who        had
been     drinking           increased      as   time progressed        but     they        were
unnumbered by people who did not exhibit any signs of drink.


The     witness           deals    with    the build     up   pressure       around            the
Leppings Lane end and turnstiles, the activities of the mounted
officers,           the     stopping      of traffic in Leppings Lane               and        the
opening        of        the concertina gates and estimates the                number           of
4,500-5,000              people spilling out from Leppings Lane towards the
turnstiles           (there        is   no timing for this).         At page        12     this
witness        says        that     he was aware that the opening            of      gate        C
would     result           in the entrance by the crowd into a               large         rear
enclosure        which would absorb pressure from the crowd.                         He     did
not     consider          the affect upon the terraces and had                 no        direct
knowledge           of    the build up in the terraces.              At page        13A     the
witness has vivid recall of seeing security and police officers
trying   to shut the                    concertina     type   gate     and     this        was
successfully shut.


At     this     time this officer was trying to organise the line                               of
police horses from the parapet towards the sweet shop.


At     page 13 this officer stated that he never saw gate B in                                 an
open     position          without gate A also being in an              open      position
when he looked they were both open at the same time.


At     page 15 and 16 there is consideration as to what occurs                                 at
league        matches when I believe 1 pen is filled at a time and at
league        matches       it is not uncommon to have police officers                         at
the back of the terraces.


Again     at page 16 the reason for not having police officers                                 on
the     terraces          at an all ticket match was for the officers                       own

 o
safety.             There        is     tendancy     for     agression       against       police
officers.


The witness Creaser's evidence in chief finishes at page 16.


Mr     Hytner           commenced his cross-examination of the                     witness        at
page 16.


At     page        17     this witness was able to give                 assurance         to    the
enquiry           that        steps were taken that no person was regarded                        as
dead and not treated as dead until they had been certified dead
by     a        doctor.        Any suggestion otherwise could                be     discounted
completely.


Bodies           were     put in plastic PVC body bags and the                     temperature
was very warm in the temporary mortuary.


The     witness           confirmed that a officer was allocated                     to        every
body.            Each     of those allocated officers were pestered by                          the
witness Creaser with the question "Are you sure we have got the
name of the doctor who certified death?"


Counsel           then        turned to the capacity at the Leppings Lane                        end
and        at     page 18 the witness was questioned about the                         possible
throughput               of     spectators       through      the     Leppings      Lane         end
turnstiles              but    the      police     did     not work     on   the     basis        of
mathematical formulae but on experience.


At     page 28 in relation to the packing of pens 3 and 4 and                                   the
standards           to        be applied when appreciated that those pens                       are
nearly           full     at     page     28C the    witness        agrees    with        Counsel
(Hytner) that the people able to prevent more fans getting into
those           pens once it appeared to be nearing the safety                         capacity
are.       not     the policemen on the perimeter fence or in                        the       west
stand           but the policemen and stewards in the concourse                           between
the        turnstiles and the stand wall and since the police and the
stewards in that position cannot see the pens they have to have
the information conveyed to them immediately following this the
witness          was attacked on the basis that some method was                       needed
to     activate the police and stewards in that area.                         At page 2 9E
it     is     suggested to the witness that allowance should be                            made
upon        information           coming     from     police control    and     the        club
monitor          and      that     club monitor information will come                to        the
witness by the police in the club monitor room.                         Page 3IE given
a     position          where pens 3 and 4 were full upon an awareness                          of
that        situation          the witness states an officer of the              rank           of
Inspector is quite capable of taking a decision to stop further
fans        going down the tunnel and would inform control "I am                               now
going       to      stop any fans going down the central tunnel".                          This
was the theory of the position assumed in planning.                            At page 33
the     witness           accepts that had he been told that             control          were
going       to      open       gate C to relieve the pressure           of     the        crowd
outside and had further been told that control did not want any
more        spectators in pens 3 and 4 he could quite easily within a
minute        of        two    have     organised police officers        to     be        in     a
position to prevent egress through the tunnel.


Cross-examination of the witness Creaser finishes at page 33.


Cross-examination                 by Mr Jackson commences at page 33 and in                      a
short       cross-examination agreed that crowd control was so                            much
an     obvious part of police duty that it was not surprising that
it was in standing orders.


Still       at pagee 33 the witness was cross-examined by Mr Maxwell
and was questioned about fans without tickets and confirmed his
estimate           of     about       200.   There were little groups of             half        a
dozen       or so going around without tickets totalling perhaps 2 00
in      all        at    the      Leppings     Lane    end   of   the   ground.             The
cross-examination                 by Mr Maxwell of this witness ended at                  page
35.


At     page        36 Mr Gibson-Watt commenced his cross-examination                           of
the witness Creaser.
The     witness        gave     evidence concerning the         opening       of        gates
generally and confirmed that such an action would only be taken
by the police in the event of an emergency.


At     page 37C there is a reference to the witness' understanding
that     the tunnel was blocked off in 1988.                  The witness believes
it was done but has no recall of the decision or orders given.


Cross-examination by Mr Gibson-Watts ends at page 38.


At the bottom of page 38 the cross-examination by Mr Kallipetis
commences.         At     page 39 reference is made to the notes in                      the
Operational            Orders     for     emergency   evacuation        procedure but
reducing        the plan to a few words it was - open the big                       gates,
and     the     emptying        of specific pens was not laid down                 in    the
evacuation        procedure.        The evacuation of the central pens                   was
through the way they came in out through the tunnel.


Cross-examination by Mr Kallipetis ends at page 40.


The cross-examination by Mr Glasgow commences at page 40 and at
40G     in     response to a question in relation to intelligence                          or
otherwise that there would be particular crowds turning up late
or     without tickets in respect of which contingency plans might
be     needed     the     witness        said "I am   aware     that     intelligence
gathering        and     liaison    between officers          from     Sheffield         and
Liverpool        had taken place and to the best of my knowledge that
information, if it exists, had not been forthcoming."


The    witness         was questioned about his knowledge in                 connection
with     telecommunication          between      the Hertfordshire           force       and
Liverpool        concerning the intention of Liverpool fans to arrive
without        tickets but the witness had no first hand knowledge of
this     but    the     witness         now understood   that        quite   elaborate
contingency plans had been drawn up.
Mr     Glasgow       pursued          his questioning as to             how     this       witness
estimated           200 fans without tickets, the witness said it                                could
have     been 400 and then said perhaps not too much weight should
be attached to such evidence.


At     page 43C the witness accepted that it was worrying that                                      an
important piece of intelligence about Liverpool club itself had
not     been collected by the police officer with the specifically
designated          role        of    liaison but said it          had        never       happened
before        in his experience.               With regard to problems at Leppings
Lane end the witness said "not to paint too rosy a picture - we
do     have        problems at that end - but they have all easily                                been
accommodated             by the numbers of police officers that have                              been
there.        At    page 44 a cross-examination by Mr Glasgow                             of      this
witness is finished.


Cross     examination by Mr Woodwood of Mr Creaser starts at                                      page
44.


Mr     Woodwood           explored the responsibilities of officers of                             the
rank     of        Inspector.          At page 45D questions were                   put     to     the
witness        concerning             the     briefing of     stewards         and        stewards'
responsibilities                and     this    witness went into the                west        stand
where     Inspector             White had assembled a large quantity                        of     the
stewards and he was outlining their particular responsibilities
in     relation           to how they should deal with the crowd.                         At      page
45F     the        witness says that he did not hear the whole                            briefing
but     when        he     arrived          Mr White was putlining            the     duties        of
stewards           in relation to the people arriving in the west stand,
saying        that        the    police would in no way            be     responsible              for
seeing         people           to     their     seats,     that   was         the         stewards
responsibility.                 In     the event of disputes over a seat, a                        fan
might say there was somebody sat in seat B26 and he had got the
ticket to B26, we would say that was a stewards responsibility.
But     he was saying there would be police officers to assist                                      if
things got out of hand.                      At page 45G the witness agreed with Mr
Woodwood           that     there       was some lines being drawn                  between        the
responsibility of the police and the responsibility of the club
and     the        stewards, concerning the positioning and ordering                        of
people        at        the ground.      Following that the witness said I                 was
impressed           by the way in which the briefing was being conducted
and     stewards           being given very clear and concise                instructions
and     in response to the question is that a point at which                              some
emphasis           is made on those occasions the witness responded                        yes
sir.          (Having           made   this    rather      general   point     concerning
stewards           Mr     Woodwood did not pursue the question of what                     the
clear and concise instructions were further.                         There is evidence
at     page        47 of a Sunday game, Leeds against Coventry in                        1987,
when     a system was being operated whereby fans were directed to
particular pens at the Leppings Lane end and to keep control of
the     movement of those fans because it created difficuties when
they     wanted to us the club facilities - refreshments,                           toilets
etc.      The           doors     at   the    rear   of     tunnel   were     closed       and
controlled by police officers who opened the door to let people
out.      There           were perhaps up to five officers controlling                     the
gates     - possibly a police horse.                      The tunnel gate was           closed
when the pens were considered to be full.


Continued           on page 48 there is further evidence in relation                        to
the     1987        semi-final and the requirement by the Commander                        who
wanted the individual pens to be filled individually.


There     is continued evidence of how this system was operated at
page 49.


Once     the centre pens were filled the filling of the outer pens
was     regulated           by use of the control of the radial               gates        and
tunnel gates.              Once the outer pens were say three quarters full
then     the        officers controlling the gate withdrew                   leaving       the
gate     open.            A similar situation related to the tunnel                     gates.
None     of those gates were left closed during a match.                           At     page
50     this officer says at D in 1988 there was a different policy
adopted        in        letting fans find their own level.             At the end          of
page     50E        the     witness further says that in             1988    the        tunnel
access        gates were also closed.            Pressed by Counsel the witness
said     to     the best of my recollection the gates to                 the    tunnel
were closed in 1988 for a short period.                  On page 51 the witness
says that one of the police at the gate was a Sergeant Higgins.
From     page 51D through H referring to 1988 the witness                      Creaser
says     that there were no stewards present when the door to                         the
tunnel     was        closed and they in relation to the disposition                   of
stewards        round       the ground the witness said "the stewards                 who
would be in the proximity of that tunnel would be probably four
stewards at the bottom of gangway XYZ and if necessary a police
officer would call on them to give assistance but that would be
unlikely.            There are people who supervise the stewards.                I     do
not     know        what    their title is but they are          stewards      with     a
supervisory           responsibility, who move around, who are I believe
in radio contact on the club's radio scheme.                     I think they wear
an     armband        in     addition or perhaps an armband         instead      of     a
waitcoat.            There were stewards at gates A, B and C.               I believe
four     stewards on gate C, a similar number on B and perhaps two
or three on A.


The    previous            remarks having related to 1988 the witness             then
confirmed           that there were stewards about in 1989 in accordance
with     that sort of arrangement and the witness saw                    supervising
stewards        coming       round     and checking on their men         and    on the
situation            and         the   witness   believed that    thesupervisory
stewards had radio contact.


At 15H and over the page at 52 asked whether he was aware as to
whether        or     not the ground keeps any interest or concern                upon
the    activities           in    the turnstiles and the way       the      turnstile
operators           are      faring this witness said "yes sir.             There are
members        of theclub office staff.           For example, I      know one as
______    - I don't know his surname - who is always in possession
of a radio.           He is frequently seen as Leppings Lane, and infact
this     year        he was asked to attend at Leppings Lane to                examine
some suspect forgery tickets".
With     regard        to     the operation of the turnstiles at          page     5 2C
asked     whether           he had the impression that the turnstiles             were
for      whatever           reason   not   coping    as   efficiently     as      they
ordinarily        did the witness said "no sir.             I got the impression
that     people        were going through the turnstiles as             quickly     as
the     turnstiles           could allow them.      The fact was that      so     many
people arrived at once or in a short period of time."


Asked     whether the witness observed people trying to defeat the
turnstiles        by        crowding up close behind the chap in front            who
had     got a ticket or crawling underneath or climbing over                      this
witness     said "I did not see that but I am aware that that took
place.     Other officers told me that was happening."


At page 52 luncheon adjournment was called until 2.00pm.

Chief Inspector R.W. Creaser re-called and cross-examined by Mr
Woodwood (continued)


At     page 53 the witness Creaser was cross-examined in                relation
to     the    consideration given to closing Leppings Lane at                 about
2.30 or 2.35.


At     page        56 the witness was asked about police horses and             the
use made of them and witness says once the police horses are in
a line nose to tail making a barrier there is a gap between the
police        horses and the people outside the turnstiles but                there
was     still pressure from the back of the crowd pushing                forward
towards       the turnstiles.          People with space at their backs were
still pushing the people in front of them.


At     page 58 this witness thought that the line of police horses
was     improving the position except for the crowd still                pushing
at     the     back when the gates were opened and the need             for     the
cordon         no      longer   existed,     the   cordon   was   breached       by
individuals          but there wasn't a mass surge through that cordon.
At     page 60 having previously said that he had recollection                   of
seeing        gates A, B and C all opened he confirmed that he had no
doubt that gate B opened and he saw people going through it.


At     page        62 the witness is questioned about the use of             police
horses        and     the possible suggestion that the horse should             not
have     been used in the packed area.             The officer agreed with Mr
Woodwood           suggestion   that     horses in that     situation   had     the
affect        of     preventing a crowd becoming jammed and packed.             At
page     65H the cross-examination of this witness by Mr                Woodwood
finished           with the witness confirming that there were a greater
number        of     individuals   who ought to have been         arrested     than
there were men available to do it.
A t p a g e 66 t h e w i t n e s s   is    r e - e x a m i n e d b y Mr C o l l i n s .


Mr     Collins         established that the number that should have                                       been
arrested         exceeded      40     or      thereabouts.              On     page        68        it     is
established            through this witness that the Sergeant Higgins                                       he
had previously referred to as closing the gate to the tunnel at
the 1988 match was a retired officer but it was thought that he
had     made      a     statement         and Mr Woodwood             said       that          he     would
endeavour        to      produce that statement.                   At page 69             Mr        Collins
completed         his     re-examination of the witness Creaser                                 and        the
Judge asked the witness some questions.


After     the         Judge had asked his questions and the                           witness              had
agreed      that the situation as it arose had it been foreseen was
not     unpolicable but the situation would have needed discussion
around      a    table and certainly more police officers and                                        police
horses would have been used.


Further         cross-examined by Mr Woodwood in relation to the                                          1987
semi-final.             The witness said although the overall control                                       in
1987     was     under      Mr Mole the officer at the ground who                                    had     a
preference            for filling each individual pen separately was                                       the
officer        who was performing the identical role as that                                        carried
out by Superintendent Murray this year.

Afternoon session - Page 70
Witness Inspector Peter Darling examined by Mr Goldsack.


Inspector Peter Darling was in charge serials 1, 2 and 3 at the
1989    match,           serial     1 being those officers who       were     on        the
perimeter fence.


This     officer had not been at the match the previous year.                            He
did not see the Operational Order for 1988.


At     page       71     with     regard to      personal   radios   this    officers
evidence          was that community constables have their own personal
issue radios but otherwise in general radios are only issued to
Sergeants          and above.        Community constables tended to be around
the     perimeter             fences on the track.       At page 72D this     officer
makes        reference          to his having briefed stewards for the             south
stand.


There        is        reference to the Order in Court document tab 14                  "NO
ONE     IS        TO    BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE TRACK FROM           THE    TERRACES
WITHOUT           CONSENT OF A SENIOR OFFICER (EXCEPT TO RECEIVE MEDICAL
ATTENTION)".              All the officers on serial 1 actually got a copy
of     that particular page of the Order.                   At page 73 the    officer
makes reference to having called in at the club control room at
something              before     2.00pm and at page 73D in the       club    control
room     there           was some discussion about the number then                in    the
ground being some 12,000 and at the same time the previous year
there has been 20,000.                At page 74 there is discussion with the
witness           concerning how full pens 3 and 4 were at 2.40pm.                     They
were     fairly           full not overcrowded, no problem.          Two     or        three
balloons           in     those     two   pens    were   being   knocked     about        by
 supporters             who     had room to jump up and knock it from             one     to
another.               At page 75 there is discussion with the witness when
he became aware at about 3.00pm when the game began that people
in     pen     3 were having difficulty breathing and who were                 being
crushed.        When he first arrived gate 3 open was open.


The     evidence in chief of the witness Darling to Mr Goldsack is
completed at page 77.

At page 77 the witness Darling is cross-examined by Mr Hytner.


At     page 77F the witness agreed that sometime before 2.00pm                       in
the     club control room the witness was told by somebody who had
a     view     of the machanical check on entry into the ground                    that
whereas 20,000 had been there at that time last year there were
now only 12,000 in the ground.                  It was apparent to this witness
visually           that the bulk of the shortfall of that 8,000 would be
Liverpool           supporters.       This was an hour before kick-off.              At
page     78H        Mr Hytner asked this witness whether it impinged                 on
his     consciousness           in the sense that he knew it was          something
that     might affect his duties that in addition to the crowd                       on
the     whole        of     the terrace which would be       controlled     by      the
computer,           visual     observation by police officers and          stewards
was the only means of checking when each individual pen reached
its          safety       capacity,   pre-determined       safety   capacity.        In
response to this the witness said it wasn't the only means.                          Of
course,        we did have the video cameras inside the ground                   which
 gave a view to ground control.                 At page 81C having been pressed
 by Mr Hytner as to fans finding their own level in pens 3 and 4
 and     what        action was to be taken if the safe capacity              of    the
 pens         were        thought     to   be   exceeded     the    witness        says
 "traditionally, there are obviously stewards .....                    I was aware
 there        were stewards at the back of the west stand there and                    I
 would        have     expected them to take some sort of action.              I    was
 not     involved obviously in the briefing of the stewards                    behind
 the     west        stand.    I do not know exactly what was said to              them
 but     that        was    regarded as far as I was concerned as          part      of
 their job - the packing, the filling of terraces".


 Again        at     page     8IE it having been put to this witness           by     Mr
Hytner    that        the system was that the fans be trusted                   to      find
their     own       level to a safe capacity the witness answered                      yes,
but      in     addition       I     considered      the   stewards      had        certain
responsibility for making sure that it did not get overfull and
I repeat what I said before,                 that if we got to astage where we
thought         that    capacity was being exceeded, then we would                      take
action        but     certainly there had got to be a certain amount                       of
trust     in        the behaviour of the supporters.             At page 8IF           asked
what     he expected would be done if the fans filled pens 3 and 4
to     an unsafe density the witness replied "I would expect                            that
whoever        noticed       that,      whoever      saw that,    to    inform        ground,
controlso that they could take any further action                             which     they
thought        might be necessary, obviously that being at the back of
the tunnel where there were both police officers and stewards.


Cross-examination             of     the    witness     Darling by      Mr     Hytner      is
completed at page 81.


The witness was cross-examined by Mr Glasgow commencing at page
81.      At pages 81G and H and 82 A, B, C, D, E, F and G there is
important           cross-examination         of     this witness      concerning         the
duties        of     stewards and it might become necessary for                     you    to
read     the        original of this cross-examination evidence                     but    in
brief     the        witness said

          the        stewards      at      the back of the west stand           can       help
          with        the    monitoring        of the situation        or     the     senior
              steward       at the back of the terracing there, is in radio
              contact       with the club so that if there was any                   problem
              he could certainly be contacted that way.


              The    witness       didn't     work    behind the       west     stand      but
              understood       that there was someone there in a stewarding
              capacity       who     had    radio contact,       someone       behind      the
              terraces, at the other side of the tunnel.


              The     sort    of information he thought the club were in                        a
          position           to     give was if a police officer or if                  ground
          control           had     noticed any         problems there, then           through
          ground           control we can inform certainly the club, ie. Mr
          Lock        or    Mr      Macrell        and I understand they         are        in     a
          position then to pass details on to the stewards there.


          Challenged on the suggested chain of command the witness
          there were both police officers and stewards at the back
          there.


          The     witness           said        that if the police saw there           was         a
          problem           building        up then certainly the stewards              would
          want        to     know, as would the police officers,                  and        that
          would go through ground control.


          Asked        whether            the     officer    responsible    for         police
          officers           expected           the stewards behind the stand to                  be
          monitoring              the     position the witness said         they        cannot
          monitor the situation in that they know exactly how many
          is in at one moment in time.                      What I am trying to say is
          that        if we got to a stage where there was potentially a
          problem then the stewards and the police officers at the
          back        of the Leppings Lane terrace would need to know of
          that,        so that some sort of action could be taken, be it
          by     stewards or by police officers and the only means of
          them being told is a) through ground control which means
          in     respect           of police officers messages will be                  passed
          from        ground        control        to   either the   sergeant          or        the
          inspector           in        charge     of those police    officers          or       b)
          passed to the stewards through the club.


At     page     84C it was put to the officer that only people                              in     a
position to assess whether or not a problem was developing were
officers on the perimeter track or those possibly in the stands
that     overlooked           them.         The    witness     answered    "also        ground
control        - and I am not sure, although I mentioned I went                              into
the.    room     at        the back of the south stand where               the     counting
machinery       is, I know there are cameras there or that there are
monitors       there, exactly what part of the ground they show I do
not    know.     I did not particuarly look at them.                It may be that
staffing       there   can    also         see the state    of   the    terrace     at
Leppings Lane, but I do not know.


The    cross-examination of the witness Darling by Mr Glasgow was
completed at page 84.


The    cross-examination            of the witness Darling by          Mr     Woodwood
commenced at page 84.


This    cross-examination            did     not add anything to        the    overall
evidence       save    at    page     90     this witness    said      that    he   was
constantly       abused by Liverpool fans that there were not enough
tickets     for Liverpool at different times during the melee that
followed.


The cross-examination by Mr Woodwood completed at page 90.


At page 90 the witness Darling was re-examined by Mr Collins.


Nothing     of interest arose and the examination of this                      witness
was completed at page 93.

          Volume 4 of DAC bundle of transcripts
          Monday 5th June 1989
          Afternoon session - page 93
          Witness       Inspector       David    Bullas    called and      examined          by    Mr
          Phillips.


          Inspector       David Bullas on 15th April 1989 was the Inspector in
          charge of serial 13 which was positioned in the west stand over
          the Leppings Lane terraces.


          Reference       was    made to tab 14 where reference is made to                        this
          serial.       This witness' superior was Superintendent Greenwood.


          The     witness       did    not    receive     any   specific    instruction             in
          relation       to the terraces below the west stand and did not give
          any     particular          instruction to the officers in his            serial          in
          relation to the terrace below the west stand.


          At     page    99 there having been no crowding in pens 3 and                       4     in
          this     officers estimation until about 3 o'clock when the                         teams
          were     on    the     pitch but he did not know whether               kick-off          had
          taken     place       or not.      He observed in the pen beneath him                   from
          the     direction       of the tunnel what he described as a               river          of
          people        flowing down the terrace directly towards the pitch and
          spredding       out.        He did not know whether it was in both pens                    3
          and     4 or in just one of them.             The movement was to his              right.
          The     movement went forward and then did not go back as was                            his
          previous experience.


          At page 100 he saw people in distress.


          The     witness       has     difficulty with his timing         but     he        recalls
          thinking        "there       is    something happened here" and he             got       the
          radio     and tried to contact the police control room.                       He     tried
          three     times       but failed to get through on each            occasion.              He
          recalled        having previously heard something about the gates but
it    had had no s i g n i f i c a n c e   to   h im a t t h e t i m e .


The     witness attracted the attention of a police officer                                 stood
at     the side of the goal and waved and pointed down towards the
crowd       trying      to     indicate that there             was aproblem       and        that
officer        walked        towards the fence and looked into                  the     crowd.
The      officer      then intended to go down                 below and see      what           the
problem        was and as he was leaving the                   stand he saw one of               the
gates       open inthe perimeter fence and saw people climbing                               over
the fencing.


This      officer       went     into the tunnel.              There were      officers           in
front       of him on the terracing by the time he got there.                               There
were      spectators still going forward and people trying to                                come
get out of the tunnel and then going into the tunnel he saw the
crowd       parting      and the first injured people were passed                           back.
At     page 102 the officer says there were still people going                                    in
and people coming out at that time.


At page 103 having started to assist an injured 14 year old boy
this        officer          took    no     further      part      apparently          in        the
organisation           around       or     about the area of the tunnel                 or       the
concourse.          The boy in fact died.

At page 103 the witness Bullas is cross-examined by Mr Hytner.


Nothing        of    particular           interest and it was              completed        by    Mr
Hytner at page 107.


At      page     107 the cross-examination of Mr Bullas by Mr                           Glasgow
commenced.


At      page     108C through F the witness says that he did not                                 know
the      packing of the terraces was a police duty.                           He thought          it
was     the        stewards' duty to pack the terraces.      He    thought        at
league        games that it was the stewards who packed the           terraces
and     with        regard    to the briefing relating to the      packing        of
terraces he could not recall there was any difference                   between
the league and the semi-final.


The cross-examination of Mr Bullas by Mr Glasgow ends at                     page
108.


Mr Woodwood cross-examination the witness Bullas commencing at
page 108.


Counsel        pursued       the responsibilities for packing of      terraces
further        and said that he had never regarded himself as           having
any     role or responsibility for the packing of the fans in                    the
terraces,           for   safety etc yes, that was police     responsibility
but the actual packing no.            This at page 108G.


At     page        109 is questioned further on this and maintained              his
attitude.            He   said there were stewards on the west       stand        in
1989     at different parts of the gangway.          There was steward            at
least     on each exit out of the stand and this officer made sure
that     there was always a steward at either end of the              frontage
of     the stand where the emergency exits are.            Timed at 3.00pm a
photograph           DB   17/14   the witness identifies a    steward       in     a
yellow waistcoat.            At page 112B as this witness was leaving the
west     stand to go down to the terrace having observed a problem
in     the pen there was a steward stood at the exit from which he
left.         At     page 112H the witness said that when he was at              the
tunnel        and     he saw those who had been hurt being        brought        out
from     the tunnel there was no sort of organisation in              training
to     help        deal with them.   They were taken to the mouth of             the
tunnel at the back of the tunnel to the concourse placed on the
floor and they were assisted by police officers.

 Witness Inspector Gordon Sykes examined by Mr Collins.


 Inspector Gordon Sykes was the Inspector in                              charge       together
 with Mr Purdy of serials 16-19 inclusive.


 Having       read    this     witness'          evidence both       in    chief         and    in
 cross-examination            and        since    it    adds    little     to      the     total
 knowledge I refer to pages only and not to whether the evidence
 in chief or by cross-examination by one of the Counsel.


At     page    4E     there is reference to the flow rate                     through          the
turnstiles          and there has been previous reference to this, this
officers       says     that        he    had    seen    people      jumping       over        the
turnstiles        without          paying and also coming under the                    legs     of
people who were in the turnstile, so this was, in fact, causing
the     flow    rate     through          the turnstiles        to     slow      down.         His
impression        was that the build-up outside was originally caused
by the slow rate through the turnstiles due to this.


Then     at    page     4F,        G and H there is        reference        to     Sheffield
Wednesday       steward        club gatemen at gate C seeking                    the     advice
and     assistance of this Inspector on the grounds that there was
some     thirty      people         outside who claimed to be              stewards        from
Liverpool       football           club, they had passes to that effect,                       the
steward       informed this officer that he allowed a certain number
of    the     stewards        in    because       that    was    the      agreement        with
Liverpool but he did not believe that all these people were, in
fact,       stewards.        He suspected that people were going in                        with
the passes and then the passes were being brought out again and
used again. This officer advised the steward not to let anyone
else in on those grounds.


This officer entered the ground through gate C and made for the
police control box but as he got to the top of the steps to the
control box he saw what was happening on the field, realised it
wasn't a normal pitch invasion and that people at the back were
pushing and crushing the people at the front.


At     page 6 there is evidence that he ran back round the back of
the     west stand and collected officers who were still coming in
through        the gates and he went through the central tunnel under
the     west     stand and went through the tunnel with his                 officers
that he had collected on the way, pushed some of the supporters
out     and     cleared        a way through the people     who     were     trapped
towards        the     front of the fencing.        He was working       about      two
thirds        of the way down the terrace moving injured people                    back
up the terrace and through the tunnel.


At     page 17D through H cross-examined by Mr Glasgow the witness
confirmed that normally the away stewards control the trains or
the     official        club supporters club, they don't have seats                 (it
doesn't        appear     to      me    that they   had tickets     either)        they
normally        just     have     a    lapel badge that says Steward        and     the
officer        said     thatthere is some debate        as to     what     influence
visiting        stewards         had but obviously it is the intention             that
they have a general calming influence in the areas where                           they
are allowed into the ground.


At     page 2 IE the witness told Mr Woodwood in                cross-examination
that     he,    witness         Sykes, asked the mounted section to           put     a
cordon        of horses across the mouth of Leppings Lane and it                    was
this witness Sykes who tried to get through on the radio to ask
for     vehicular traffic to be stopped.             He got no response            over
the     radio    and     he      spoke to Mr Marshall    who      agreed     and    Mr
Marshall got through on his radio and had the traffic stopped.


At     page     20 asked to estimate the number of             people      attending
without tickets this officer estimated the number at 2,000.

Inspector Robert Purdy called and examined by Mr Goldsack.


Inspector           Robert    Purdy was working in tandem     with     Inspector
Sykes with overall command of serials 16 and 19.                     His    duties
were outside the turnstiles.


At     page     29     there is reference to    non-ticket     holders       being
inside        the     perimeter gate and on a number of       occasions       this
officer        had     that area swept by the horses whereby         non-ticket
holders were ushered to the exterior gate to be removed out and
dispersed           along    Leppings Lane or Catspar Lane.    At     page     2 9G
this     witness it was him that caused the gate to be opened down
the     side,       gate C.    The witness had received an order from           Mr
Marshall        for the gates to be opened.       This witness interpreted
that     Mr Marshall's instruction to be for gate C to be                  opened.
Gate     C opens from the inside.         As he reached the gate the gate
C     opened     in front of him for the ejection of a fan, with               the
opening        of     the gate this officer was pushed into the left            of
the     gate towards turnstile G but inside and turned around                  and
ordered the gate closed.            This at page 30.


At     page 21        the witness explains that his intentionin        having
the    gate     closed       relied upon the fact that they had        got     the
horses       to seal the gates off at the perimeter gates and if the
people       from the area were removed through gate C he could then
deal     with the problem of people trapped against the funnel bar
and    could        bring them in and feed them out from       there        giving
them     a    relief area.       This officer came out by the        turnstiles
area     again and C gate was opened again for a second time.                  The
officer   had no specific part in the opening of the                  gate     for
the second time.


At    page     31 this officer gives evidence that he          went        through
into     the ground when there was a call to go onto the pitch and
he     took    serials down with him onto the pitch to an area                      near
gate     3    and saw the injuries that had occurred.             At    page         32D
this     officer     was     aware of a large object      being        thrown        and
landing       on    the    pitch   somewhere near   the    goalpost           and     he
believed       it    to be a large blue crash barrier bar.              The     piece
was 10 or 12 feet long.


At     page 49 in response to Mr Woodwood the witness said he                        did
not     observe any stewards outside in the forecourt at the front
of the turnstiles at any time.


The evidence of the witness Purdy finishes as page 50.

Inspector Stephen Ellis called and examined by Mr Phillips.


Inspector        Stephen Ellis was in charge of serials 36, 37 and 38
on     the day in question.             This involved him in going to Wadsley
Bridge     Station to collect supporters who had arrived by                               train
from     Liverpool         and      serials 36 and 37 escorted              them     to       the
ground.        There was also a serial of horsemen escorting them to
the     ground.       This officer's serials stayed in the vicinity                            of
Leppings       Lane turnstiles.              At page 51 this officer dealt                   with
three     gentlemen who complained that they had purchased tickets
from a small boy about nine years old spending every penny they
had     brought       with     them from Liverpool and              the     tickets          were
simply     photocopies             roughly     coloured in with           yellow     crayon.
This     officer       advised them to go and find him and                   detain           and
give     him     to    the       nearest policemen.         At page 52C       and        D     in
response       to     the Judge who picked the witness up on his                          words
"confusion        with       the    tickets" the witness said               that     he       had
receiving        enquiries         about tickets all the time and he                     though
that      that      was     probably         the   reason    that    there         was       some
confusion,          people going to the wrong turnstiles and not                         being
able     to move away having realised that they were at the                              wrong
one.     The Judge asked him whether he though this was because of
the     markings       on the tickets and above the turnstiles and                           the
witness     that       he could not say.           One gentleman approached                  the
witness     and just simply asked him if it was Leppings Lane.                                He
had     obviously walked the full length of Leppings Lane and                                was
just     going with the crowd.               This witness though that if he was
on     top of the Land Rover he could direct them to the different
stands,     the north stand or Leppings Lane and there was so much
noise     perhaps         they were not able to hear the              public        address
system and he thought it might assist if he was able to direct
them visually.
At     page     53E     it      becomes   apparent that     Mr     Buxton       was    the
Land     Rover        driver and it was this witness on the top                 of     the
Land     Rover        using the microphone to the           Land    Rover       speaker
system        and     he was continually broadcasting appeals.                 At     page
53F this witness said that he told the crowd that he was trying
to     delay        kick-off and he said this to the crowd               outside       the
gate     several times whereas in actual fact this witness                          wasn't
aware     at        that time that the police were trying to                  delay    the
kick off.           The witness said it to appease the crowd.


At     page 53H the witness understood from PC Buxton that he                          had
made      three        definate      appeals   over   the    radio       to     control
(apparently           for kick-off to be delayed).          This witness thought
that     the        delay of kick-off would be helpful to the                  situation
because        he     thought the crowd was simply desparate to get                    in.
This     at page 54B.            This witness gave evidence at 54F that when
the     police horses made a line to prevent further access to the
turnstiles          there       was one avenue of access through the                horses
probably the width of the horse at the point of the V shape for
supporters to gain access through.               This officer broadcast this
over the public address system.


On     page 55 the witness says that at about 3.10pm he was                          aware
of     a definate instruction to close the gates and heard all the
turnstile doors, the wooden doors slamming shut and he assisted
other     officers         to    close the perimeter gates.         He     heard       the
instruction          for     officers to go to the pitch.          He    thought        it
came over his radio twice.


This     witness did not personally have the gates opened to                          give
ambulance but ambulance did come through.                   This at page 55.


At     page    56 the witness saw ambulances coming through all                       the
time     entering       at the Leppings Lane entrance and                leaving      via
Penniston Road north entrance.


It     was not this officers specific task to keep the route clear
for     ambulances          but in fact that is what he assisted          in.      He
also     knew that Superintendent Marshall similarly directed some
officers        also.        At page 56 this witness heard appeals             coming
over     the     tanoy above the turnstile gates for people               to     stop
pushing        quite clearly. It was clearly audible.             This     between
2.40 and       2.50.        This in response to a question by Mr Woodwood.


At     page    57D the witness says that when he was using the public
address        system        on   the Land Rover the only time     he     saw    the
crowd     take        any    notice of his appears was when       he     indicated
that     there was a space between the horses and he was satisfied
that     the     crowd could hear quite clearly what he was saying
they     were just not taking any notice to his other appeals.                    At
page 59G the witness having described a situation when the main
bulk     of the crowd had gone through gate C from behind them and
left the comparatively small remaining supporters still waiting
to     gain entry, who had been entirely relieved of the                 pressure
that     they        were    simply   still fighting   to   get   through,        or
pushing,        to     get through the turnstiles.      Some were        literally
diving        over without even touching the turnstiles.            Others were
clambering over.             They were getting through any way they could.
They     could have gone through gate C at that stage if they                    had
been     aware        of it but the officer assumes that they           were     not
aware of it and they were just intent on getting inside without
any    pressure on them, no physical pressure.              There was nothing
behind     them other than the horses which are still outside                    the
perimeter gates and then about 200 supporters milling around in
front of the horses.


At page 61 re-examined by Mr Collins the witness said he though
that     delaying the kick-off would have been the only thing that
would have appeased the supporters outside Leppings Lane                         but
the kick-off was not delayed.

Morning session - page 61
Witness Inspector                  John Joseph Bennett called and examined            by
Mr Collins.


Inspector        John Bennett was in charge of property stores at the
ground on the day in question which was one of his duties.


One of the stores that is the one for the Liverpool supporters,
is situated behind turnstiles 1-16.


At     page 62 this officer was approached by one of the gate                        man
from     the gate who was obviously having problems there.                       Gate A
is     usually used to allow access to the ground to either police
officers        or other people who are authorised to move in and out
of the ground but the gate man told this witness that there was
a great deal of pressure of people behind the gate and that had
made     it     impossible for him to allow people in or out                    he   was
afraid        the crowd would flood in if he opened the gate to allow
anyone        out.     The gate man told the officer that he had                 locked
the     gate     and the officer confirmed that that was the                    correct
course     of action.              At about this time during the course of the
conversation           several        fans appeared at the top of         the    gates,
probably        15     or     20     feet from the     ground   and   this      officer
signalled        for        them to get down.        They stayed for a while         and
they then in fact did get down.                 They got down outside.


On page 62 this witness casts around for assistance because the
witness       wanted to respond to the request made by the gate                      man
but     could        only find one officer and then he            found      Inspector
White     who was in charge of serials 14 and 15 but this                       officer
indicated       that        his officers were fully engaged and could                not
help    with gate A from the inside.                 He made a request to police
control       via     the     radio     when he got     through   and     asked      for
officers       to     come     to     assist people to     gain   access        through
turnstiles        1-16     the     request was        acknowledged        and        officers
attended       very shortly afterwards.               One of the reserve              serials
with     SergeantHiggins and Inspector                  Delaney.     This        would       be
about      2.45pm.         At page 63F, G and H this officer                was        either
aware    of     or    had reported to him various                problems        with       the
turnstiles:-

         There       was     a    particular turnstile that was                 manned       by x
         quite       an     elderly gentlement and he was working                      rather
         slowly within his capacity but rather slowly.


         At       one      stage    another       turnstile      operator        left        his
         turnstile          in     fact    and    chased   into     the     ground           and
          remonstrated with one man who had just gained access.                                I
          do    not know what the problem was but there was a                           short
          argument         before       police officers took over and the                    man
          returned to his turnstile.

          There      were        obviously problems with people             reaching            a
          turnstile and finding it was the wrong turnstile, either
          they       wanted to go on the terrace or the north stand and
           they      were at the opposite turnstile to the one they had
           been      at.        There     was    no   room for     them     to       move     to
           alternative turnstiles.


           The witness           saw people trying to pay at the turnstiles.


           There        were     people trying to gain           unauthorised           access
           either          by climbing over the turnstiles or                   by     several
           people         crowing in to the turnstile and trying to get in
           three people say with two tickets.


 The    witness         explained       when he said "climbing over1                  that     he
 meant     inside         the    turnstile but over        the     actualy           mechanism
 rather than over the roof.

 At     page    64 this officer was concerned at the strength of                              the
crush     and at page 64D he instructed all the officers who                         were
there     to     encourage everybody to come through the              turnstiles,
whether        they were authorised or not, whether they had                tickets
or     not.     Effectively, his intention was to allow everybody                      in
without interference.


At     page 65 the witness becomes concerned that people                   climbing
over     the     top of the turnstile roof were in danger because                      of
electric cables and so on and the officer himself climbed on to
a    turnstile         roof to stop the crowd shinning along the top                   of
gate     B     where     the cables and electric lamps were.              Prior        to
climbing        up     there and giving instructions concerning                letting
people        through the turnstiles this officer radioed through                      to
police        control asking them to relieve the pressure.                He     asked
police        control to arrange for some relief of the pressure.                      He
radioed twice but does not recall any acknowledgement.                         This at
page 65.


At     page 66 once this officer was on the roof of the turnstiles
he became so aware of the danger of the crush at the turnstiles
that     instead        of        turning people away from climbing        over        the
turnstile        roof        he     assisted   them.   Many   or   most    of        those
climbing        over     the roof were waving their tickets.              Some        fans
one     inside       attempted to pass their tickets back down                  to     the
crowd outside the turnstiles but the officer thinked he stopped
that.

Once     the     crush had been reduced this officer arranged                    for     a
police horse to be positioned on the outside of gate B.


At page 68 the enquiry adjourned for lunch.

Inspector John Joseph Bennett recalled and cross-examined by Mr
Glasgow.


At     page        72having been questioned by Mr        Glasgow          about    the
turnstile          operator who left his turnstile to remonstrate                 with
someone          who         had   come through the turnstile at page      72B     the
witness          says "I have never seen a turnstile operator              actually
leave       his        turnstile before, but the turnstile operators              were
suffering          the same frustrations as everyone else there.                 I was
not     particularly surprised to see it.              I am not saying that he
left     his post because he only left the turnstile in fact for a
few     seconds              whilst hewas arguing with the man who had            come
through          his      turnstile. I think he was joined within a          matter
of     seconds         by police officers.       They resolved the matter          and
the     turnstile operator returned to his turnstile.                It was        not
intended as any criticism of the turnstile operator".


Again       at     page       72 the witness is asked by    Mr    Glasgow       about
people       getting up to the turnstile and finding that they                    were
in    the wrong place and the suggestion having been made to                       the
witness       that once there because the crush of people they would
be    carried remorselessly to whatever turnstile they could                       get
to    the     witness          answered "so far as turnstiles A      to     G     were
concerned          it did not matter because they all allowed access on
to Leppings Lane terrace, but certainly turnstiles 1-16 roughly
half of them were for the north stand and half of them were for
access      into        the Leppings Lane terrace and       certainly       someone
arrived       at       the    wrong turnstile there was no way       they       could
transfer themselves across to an alternative                     turnstile,       the
crush was far too excessive".


It    was suggested to the witness that there was no way that                      an
individual         who found himself at the wrong turnstile could hold
matters       up by attempting to go round the other way the witness
answered       that it was physically impossible for that to happen.
He     said     in fact several people at an earlier stage they                          were
coming        through       the turnstiles.        If they had tickets and               they
had    come      through the north stand entrance and they wanted                          to
gain     access to the turnstiles the stewards inside would                             allow
them to transfer to the gate to get to the proper enclosure.


At     page 73 Mr Glasgow suggested that for whatever reason small
or     large numbers of people got to the wrong turnstiles it                             was
not     adding to the delay because they were coming through                              just
as     fast     as        everybody     else.    The   witness     replied         to     this
suggestion           "I    think      it must have contributed to            some        delay
because        there       was discussions at the turnstiles whether                      they
were     at     the right one or not and they certainly did                        not     get
through        as     quickly      as    they    would have      done   if     they        had
presented           themselves at the correct turnstiles.                I don't think
it     would        have added too much to the delay, certainly                     not     as
much as anyone without a ticket or someone trying to pay".


At     page     73C and D dealing with the question of                  the        apparent
slowness        of some of the turnstile operation this witness                           said
that if there is pressure on the turnstile before the operation
releases        it        it will not in fact release.           The person         putting
pressure        on        the   turnstile       has to stand back       to    allow        the
turnstile           operator to release the turnstile and with the                        best
will in the world it was on occasions quite impossible for some
people to stand back to allow that to happen.


The     witness did not see it but accepted the suggestion that on
occasions           officers       had to come into the receiving end of                   the
turnstiles           and press people back in order that the                   turnstiles
could be released on the foot.


At     page     74 Mr Glasgow having discussed with the                      witness       the
passing        back        of tickets from inside to outside,                the    officer
said     three,           four, five he was aware of tried to pass                  tickets
back,     and        there   were numerous occasions when    two        of        three
people       tried      to   come through as a unit on one       turn        of     the
turnstile        although he did not see it, it was reported to                    him.
It     having been put to the witness that it appeared that                       there
was     some agreement between maybe small groupd to get                together
and     beat     the     turnstile system the officer     said     "there          was
clearly some sort of orcestration there but the extent of that
I have no way of establishing".


That ended the cross-examination by Mr Glasgow.              At page 74 and
75 this witness gave evidence concerning the presence of ground
staff     and/or stewards positioned at the various gates to which
they     had been allocated inside the ground at the Leppings Lane
end and immediately thereafter Mr Woodwood established with the
witness        the problem and dilemma facing the police when                people
managed        to push in get through without tickets because if                   the
police       take     action   against large numbers of     individuals             it
leaves no officers at the gates to supervise entry.


At    page      76    this witness is asked whether he was        aware           that
there    was a point at gate A when it had been locked and access
through it had been refused to a police serial to go out                           but
this witness was not aware of it.


The evidence of this witness was completed at page 77.

Continuation of the evidence of Sergeant Steven Payne                       examined

by Mr.Goldsack.



For     the operation of searching people outside                 turnstiles        A-G

this     officer       paired    his serial off, there       are     four     actual

openings,        three     pairs of two and one     single        turnstile.         He

used     eight officers two to each opening plus two                 officers        to

pair     up     with witness Payne and Inspector Purdy.              It     was     the

witnesses        intention      to    remain in those   positions          right     up

until     3     o'clock.      At page 78 this     officer     deals        with     the

arrest        of one male and one female for trying to              take     alcohol

into     the ground and the officer dealt with what he had                    to     do

when     arresting        somebody.    There is evidence of         the     arrested

peron/persons being taken to the detention room and the                       number

of     officers involved plus some paper work.              The    witness         lost

his     policewoman        officer Police Constable Huxstep who              had     to

stay     with    the     woman she had arrested because           there     was      no

woman     officer at the detention room.          At page 79         the     officer

explained       why      he was away from his position for an              hour     and

twenty minutes dealing with those two arrests.



During     a period between 2.3 0 and 3.00 this officer was                   better

able     to hear police messages coming through on                talk     through.

From about 2.45 pm the messages he heard could be summed up                          to

the     effect that people were being crushed and injured and                      the
crowds were out of control and the police were overwhelmed.                  He

did not at first appreciate that those messages related to                  the

Leppings Lane end and he realised that at about 2.55 pm that it

was     at     the    Leppings Lane end and that he heard    a     shout     of

message        to    the effect "open the gates".     At page 18     he     was

aware        that    additional   officers had been   requested    at      that

position        and so continued with his activities related        to      the

arrests.



The     whole of this police officer's evidence went         towards        the

time it took to arrest individuals and the depretion of                 police

forces that arrests caused.

Witness Graham Duffy called and examined by Mr.Phillips.



Police     Constable Graham Duffy was on serial 16 under                  Sergeant

Payne     who had just given evidence and his task            was        concerned

with the entrances A~G.           He was searching people for            offensive

weapons,        tins    of alcohol etc.    He was approached        on     several

occasions by people who had not got tickets and they were                       told

to     leave      the area. He was able to continue searching              up      to

2.15     but thereafterit became more selective.              At page 83           it

was     established       that the only officer on those gates            with      a

radio     was         Sergeant Payne and so when he left      on    the arrest

there     was         no radio there.   This at page 83 C. At      page           83,

whilst this       officer was trying to get people through the              turn­

stiles     and prevent people from being injured having of course

given     up his searching activities he fell over himself on                     the

floor     in     the crowd and was picked up by spectators and               at     a

later stage he was pushed through the turnstile over the top of

the     mechanism.        He did not climb over, he     was     pushed       over.

This at page 83G.          He went back of the turnstiles and went                out

through        Gate    C to assist people who were being        crushed.           He

said the people in the crush area were reasonably well behaved,

it was the people behind them who were pushing and causing                        the

people in this area to be crushed and the people being                     crushed
began t o      p a n ic .    The p e o p l e   a t th e   fr o n t w ere p le a d in g   fo r     th e

gates to be opened. It                   was probably that the people behind                      the

people        being crushed at turnstiles A-G actually                            went    through

Gate     C when it was opened.                  That did relieve the crush                  to     an

extent.        The people at             the back who were pushing those at                       the

front     were          more rowdy       and had obviously been              drinking.            The

officer's              impression    was that there was conserted                      effort      by

people        at       the   back    of the crowd            to     cause     some       sort      of

disruption             to facilitate their entrance into the ground                             other

than     by        a     picket.    At    page 85 D the           officer     supported           his

impression              by saying    the crush came too quickly.                  It     was      not

just     a     build up, it          was a conserted effort that                  created         the

extreme crush at the front of those turnstiles.



At page 85 cross examined by Mr.King the witness said he                                        would

have     liked to have had a radio and to have made                               communication

earlier        than before Inspector Purdy arrived on the scene.                                   At

page     86 cross examined by Mr.Jackson the police                               officer        gave

evidence           that he was briefed to maintain an orderly queue                               but

this officer's understanding in the execution of that was                                        that

he could only tell people where to go and give them                                    directions

and they take it from there.



To     make        it     clear this      officer was carrying              out    his     search

duties outside the gates                  as were the rest of his serial.

Police     Constable     D.Evans called.   Examined by       Mr.Collins          at

page 90.



Police Constable D.Evans was also on serial 16 on search duties

outside D and E.



At     page 91 this officer gives evidence that he           helped        police

Sergeant Payne at about 1.40 with his arrest.            He escorted            the

man to the police room and then returned to his post.                 At       page

91     at D this officer says that it was beginning to get                 a    bit

difficult outside the turnstiles at about 2.25.              Due to arrests

out of eight officers there were only four or five left on that

duty.    At page 72 the officer finds himself in a position                    with

P.C.     Duffy where they are trying to get out of the           crowd          but

was     unable to and said there was no hostility towards              him       or

the     other officer from the crowd.      At page 92 H       this     officer

was     crushed against the wall by the crowd and could              not       move

anything.



At page 93 D this officer gives evidence of a man trying to get

through the turnstile with a yarn about having already had                      his

ticket     or   having    lost   his   ticket   and   this     officer          got

assistance of another officer to eject him out of Gate C.                      This

after this officer had managed to get through a turnstile after
b e in g in   a crushed s it u a t io n .



At     page 94 this officer gives evidence of himself                  going      back

outside       through Gate C to assist.           At page 94 D      this     witness

having met with Mr.Purdy, Inspector Purdy, who was saying                         that

the     gate must be opened, this witness told Mr.Purdy                    that     the

gates       could     not   be opened       because   there would     be    trouble

inside.        This     officer     did     not anticipate the      trouble       that

occurred but he thought there might be violence.                    This     officer

thought that once the gates were opened it would be                     impossible

to     shut them again.         At page 95 this witness says that it                was

Mr.Purdy's          intention, Mr.Purdy told him, that he was going                  to

put the horses into position so as to filter the crowd                       through

the     gate in a manageble way.             This officer was aware that            the

gate was going to be opened again.



At     95     D the witness says that when the gate             was     opened      the

second time people went through in a relatively orderly fasion.

Page        96 F T & H this officer responded to a message                 summoning

all     officers       to   the pitch       and he went to the      pitch     but    a

uniformed        sergeant     asked him to go round to the back              of     the

terraces to pull the people away from the back of the                       terraces

at     page     97    when this officer ran to the         tunnel      with       other

officers there was nobody in the tunnel, no supporters, nobody.



At     page 97 F the witness gives evidence that the                  officers       he

had     run     with    were in front of him and         went    down      onto     the

terraces        to pull the people away because the order was to                    get
the    people      off    the   terraces so he   stopped   at    the   tunnel

entrance        because he thought there would be a staggered          effort

down the terrace to pull people back.            He had turned spectators

away     and     sent    them to the back   of   the   tunnel,    spectators

thought        that the match would be re-started and were         reluctant

to go.

P.C.Andrew Best called.                Examined by Mr.Goldsack at page 101.



Police     Constable        Andrew Best was also on               serial        16     outside

turnstiles        A-G     at page 101 F T & H which gave                  evidence          that

there     were Liverpool supporters coming through the                          turnstiles

with     Kop    tickets during a time when crowds outside                         were        low

and     managable       and     people        on    the   turnstiles       allowed          them

through        because they were people from the Nottingham area                              who

supported       Liverpool           and wanted to stand          with     the        Liverpool

supporters        and     not       with the       Nottingham     Forest        supporters.

This was certainly a decision made by turnstiles operators                                    and

stewards.         The stewards were behind the turnstiles                       and         aware

but whether they were ordering the turnstile operators or                                    not,

the     witness     did       not     know.        The witness    did     not        see    what

happened to those people once they were inside the ground.                                     At

page     102 crowds inside the ground had swelled and                           after        that

time     the     turnstile operators and/or stewards                    said         "no"     and

such     people     had       to go back through           the    crowd     which           later

became     impossible.          They were being turned back                between           2.00

and     2.30.     After 2.30 it was impossible for such people to                              be

turned     back, they were blocking the turnstiles.                        This        officer

saw between 20 and 30 people go through the F and G                              turnstiles

with     Kop     tickets.       At page 103 D the officer               gives         evidence

that     the drunken, rowdy element at the back were making                                 their
way     down     the        outside the crash bars or the         funnel     bar        and

trying to get in the front of the quere through the turnstiles.

This     upset        the     people at the front and      scuffles        broke        out

between supporters and they also scuffled with police                        officers

who tried to remove them from the area.                  The officer said there

was     one    character he pulled out two or three               times      but        the

majority        of     them were pulled away.      He did not        know     whether

they     had        tickets.     They had not got their      tickets        in     their

hands.         The people who were waiting fairly patiently                  had        got

tickets        in     their     hands.   At page   104     this     officer           gives

evidence of a man so drunk that he had no idea where he was, he

was blindly going for the turnstile, had been assaulted several

times by people in the crowd and this officer detained him                              for

his own safety.              This meant that having arrested him he had                  to

be taken off to the police room.              This was about 2.25 or                  2.35.

This     officer went to the gym.           (page 105)      There was no              radio

there     and he had no idea what was happening outside.                         It     was

3.10 when he left the gymnasium.              At page 105 F cross            examined

by     Mr.Woodward.           The witness restates that with the            knowledge

of the stewards the turnstile operator allowed people with                              Kop

tickets through.              The police were not involved in this.



At     page     105 H the officer says that on the occasion                  that        he

looked back and saw through the turnstiles, there were stewards

around in the area inside the turnstile.                  And at page 106 B the

witness        confirmed that those people, those            stewards,           (inside

the turnstiles) would have no difficulty in observing what                              was

happening           through the turnstiles and the predicament that                     the
witness   was in.   This witness' evidence is completed   at   page

P.C. Brian Huckstepp called and examined by Mr.Phillips at page

106.



Constable       Brian Robert Huckstepp told the enquiry         that       woman

Constable Huckstepp that had been referred to as his wife,                   and

she was working with this officer in the same serial, serial 16

on the turnstile nearest to Gate B on the day in question.                   The

witness     gives evidence of the depreciation of the           serial       due

to     arrests and the sergeant leaving well before 2.30            and      did

not     see the sergeant thereafter.          This officer could only        see

Constable Wright to his left.           They were checking on each other

(presumably for safety) at about 2.40 PC Wright shouted                across

to this witness that Inspector Purdy had instructed them to                   go

through the turnstile.          The officer managed with difficulty           to

get through the turnstiles.            He   went round to the back and       out

through     entrance Gate C.      When      he went through nobody came       in

through that gate.        He assisted       spectators from a point by       the

funnel     bar.     At   page    109    C this    officer   heard   officers

discussing        that the gate was going to be opened and          Inspector

Purdy instructing people.          There was officers directly         outside

Gate C, warning them that the gate was going to be opened.                   The

officer     was aware that the gate opened for the first time                and

there     was     an influx of people.       They went through at      a    fast

rate and he just entered the area directly outside Gate C.                    It
was    opened for thirty to sixty seconds.         The officer        did      not

see    it closed although he is now aware that it was closed                   for

the    assistance      of   a police force.   The crush   was         still     as

intense       as   ever.    At page 110 B the officer     says       that      the

second time the gates were opened the crowd walked through much

more sedately and in an orderly entrance into the ground.                      The

Gate C was then narrowed down to admit one or possibly two at a

time at page 110 F, the officer says there was a steward on the

gate    but the officer does not know whether he          was        collecting

tickets,       he might have just been checking them.         At      page     111

the officer said he did not have a radio and once the area                     had

cleared       he regrouped with other officers outside Gate B                where

he     believes     somebody    said there was a   message      of     a     pitch

invasion       and that group with this officer made their way                into

the ground.        Thereafter this officer was taking injured              people

from the officers who were at the fence (the perimeter fence to

the pitch) and taking them on to the pitch and treating them as

well     as he could.       Other officers were doing the       same       thing.

At     page    111 G asked about communication, he said he             did     not

have a radio and had to rely on the sergeant and inspector                     for

information.        He said he thought it would have helped if he did

have a radio.



At     page    112 this officer said that when he       was     outside        the

turnstiles         at A-G he had no idea whatsoever of what was              going

on inside the ground.



Cross examined by Mr.King at page 112 the officer gives further
evidence that unless another officer was close to him he had no

means of communicating in any way with any supervising officer.

The     officer        gives some with hindsight opinion that                 it        would

have     been better if some system had been introduced to                          direct

the fans away from the central pens and into the side ones.                                At

page     113     F     the     witness       confirmed   that     serial      16        which

originally           consisted      of   a    sergeant    and    ten    men        at     the

turnstiles        A-G        was   actually at     quarter      strength      when        the

problem        blew up.        At page 114 the witness agreed that                 he     was

effectively           on     his own trying to look after         two      turnstiles.

114 A.



Cross examined by Mr.Woodward at page 114 F in the response                                to

a     question        by the Judge the witness agreed that if                 one       more

person     who had to be arrested in this witness' vicinity                             there

would have been nothing left of his serial but he thought there

were     contingencies for relief officers, bringing reserves                             in.

There     are supposed to be two officers to escort one                       prisoner.

The     conclusion was arrest five people and the whole serial                             is

used up.



At page 115 it was put to this officer that at some stage about

50     police officers went through Gate C but the witness had                             no

knowledge        of    this whatsoever.         The evidence      of    the    witness

B.Huckstepp finishes at pages 115.

Alistair Taylor called examined by Mr.Collins at page 116.



Alistair        Taylor   was another member of serial      16    working       at
turnstile A.



This        was the officer there at about 2.15 who had to           escort     a

Liverpool fan who said he had had his ticket stolen and he                    got

back        at about 2.30.   He had gone in by Gate B and returned             to

Gate B but was unable to get back out to turnstile A again.                   At

page 116 C the officer says the steward at the gates said there

was     no    way I could get through there, I      looked      through       the

gate, the window on the gate and there was just a sea of people

so I went around to exit Gate C where I was able to get out                    of

the     inside of the ground.       He found it impossible to get           back

to his position by turnstile A and a senior officer               instructed

him     to to to the perimeter gate.       He thought that       person      was

above        Inspector   rank.   At page 117 this   officer      then      gives

evidence as to what was occurring at the perimeter gates.                   This

officer was instructed to close the gate in the perimeter fence

to     stop people coming through by the same senior            officer      and

the witness closed the gate.          This officer then instructed them

on the ways to approach the ground to get to the match.                    There

was     a    lot of crowd displeasure.     He could not bolt         the    gate

because       the bolt was in the inside.     He was the      only      officer
 there.         He    held both gates shut.         At page 118        he    allowed        a

 pregnant        woman       and    a father and a small      child         through      the

 gates.         Then there was a surge that forced the gate                    open      and

 the     officer          made sure that he went behind the gate               that      had

 remained closed and the people just came through.                       At page         119

 F after losing control of the perimeter gates he was aware that

 Gate        C was open and then he went to               the pitch and helpedwith

 attending to the injured and               helping with the bodies.          At      page

 120 B cross examined by Mr.Woodward about his efforts to                            close

the     perimeter gate, he said             at that stage the closing           of       the

gate     was        not    too     bad.   "There were a    lot   of     people        from

Sheffield           Wednesday football club going through the gate,                      and

once they had gone through it, it was quite easily shut at that

point.         At    page        121 B the witness says with      regard        to       him

losing control of the gate at the perimeter there was                          pressure

on me all the time but when that surge came it was a deliberate
surge to get through the gates.



Still        at page 121 this officer gives evidence of large                   groups

of     youths hanging around on the bridge area at Leppings                        Lane,

it was noticable that one of the lads from the group would come

to     the    turnstiles, be searched and then not               go    through        the

turnstiles but returned to the group and the rest of the                           group

were not making any attempt               to come towards the         ground at all.

The     officer saw this occur            on three occasions.At page 121             G

the    witness draws the conclusions that they were there to                          get
into the ground by some way               or another.

Tuesday 6th June 1989 - Afternoon session.




Police    Sergeant John Morgan called.            Examined by Mr.              Goldsack

at page 123.



Sergeant John Morgan has been a sergeant in F Division for some

eight years and has been present in an official capacity at 150

or so football matches at Hillsborough.



This     year    he was in charge of serial 18 who          were       positioned

outsideturnstiles            9     to 16 performing a similar        job         to    the

officers        who had given        evidence who had been in serial16.



At     page 123 G the        witness said that constantly throughout                   the

afternoon        people      were     approaching him   with brown             coloured

tickets         for the north         stand, purple coloured tickets for               the

terraces, orange          coloured tickets I believe which were for                    the

Kop     and he was constantly sending people to the correct                       entry

point.      At     page      124 the witness said he did       not     think            the

ticket     denominations were clear as they should have been,                           the

colouring        on    the tickets, and also the signs          on    the        actual

turnstiles.           They       were just squares of colour     as        I    recall.

Certainly        on my turnstiles they were red squares at the                        sides

of the doors, which were totally inadequate.               Page 124 A.



The     witness could not recall what the markings were                        like     the
previous year because he was on the track.                At page 124 E after

having       looked at West Midlands 1 photograph 7 there                 is       shown

red squares with west stand written on them.                   The officer          said

that when the people are actually queuing the sign is                      actually

invisible.           The witness would have preferred then, with                   hind­

sight, to be bigger and higher.



Still at page 124 the officer said this               year seemed to be            more

confused      than      other years as I remember.        At    page 125       G     the

witness gives evidence of a discussion with a club official                           as

to whether the tickets in one of the ticket seller's possession

was     a forgery or not and the club official gave                the     opinion,

whose     name       he does not know, as he had a radio with              him       and

thought       that     this     was   about   2.10.    Then      this     officer's

attention        was    taken     by an off-duty police        officer     who       was

reporting a crime complaint of the theft of his wallet and four

football tickets and this officer was not satisfied and went to

have     a   word with the CID officer in the           gym.       This        officer

returned to the turnstile at about 2.30.



This officer changed the battery in his radio.                   His observation

was     that messages from officers on the ground were much                        more

clear whereas messages from police control were broken.                         In the

gym     this officer saw a radio engineer who had                obviously          been

directed to the control box.             At page 130 B this witness                heard

on his radio Sergeant Goddard repeating a message several times

"all     available officers on to the perimeter track.                     Fans are

invading the pitch".
T h i s o f f i c e r m ade h i s w ay t o   th e p itc h .



At    page     130 this officer saw Mr.Murrey coming           up     the     first

gangway to the left in the south stand open section whilst this

officer       was going down and Mr.Murrey said "do what              you    can".

His    face      looked      ashen and he was obviously       in    shock.      The

officer       made his way to the perimeter fences where he                 quickly

assessed that people were already dead at the bottom left                      hand

of    10.3 on the pitch.            At page 131 the officer gives       evidence

of    officers       giving first aid and making frantic            attempts     to

pull people through the small narrow gates over the top of                      the

fences.

 Continuation of the witness Police Sargent John Morgan examined
 by Mr Goldsack at Page 131.



 This     witness have gone onto the pitch went to the bottom                        left

 of     pen     3 and looking into the terrace was           immediately            aware

 that     people were being crushed up against the pen                   fence,       and

 it    was obvious to him that people were dead already in                       there.

There        were      a lot of people already at the small gate               in     the

perimeter            fence and he immediately went round to          the       central

tunnel        because        his knowledge of the ground told him           that      it

was the obvious thing to do.               When he arrived at the tunnel              it

was     deserted the concourse at the back was deserted                   as     well.

At     Page 131G he says that when he got to the pitch end of                        the

tunnel        there     were three Police Officers two females             and       one

male     and         it is apparent to them that they were          oblivious         to

what     was happening inside.          They were looking over           the     heads

of     the     crowd in front and everything was calm.               People         were

not     trying to get out.          People were not pushing it was just                a

different           world.     This witness said to those         Officers       there

are dead bodies in their get these people out.                    This    witnessed

asked     the        people    at the back to leave the      terrace       via       the
                                    *


tunnel        and     they responded    immediately.        The     witness         then

entered        the crowd to the right of the dividing              railings         that

is    into pen        3 and pushed them away and said get          out    and most

people        did'    as they were told.    The   terrace     however      because
     some people resisted.           The witness Morgan was the first                Police

  Officer        to reach the people inside of the perimeter fence                      who
  were dead but other Officers were quickly behind him.



  After       this     the witness gives evidence of his            activities         and

  others       in     removing dead and injured from the           inside        of    the

 perimeter fence.             He is aware of two or three dozen               casualties
 dead and injured.



 Cross-examined          by    Mr.    Muller at Page 133        this     witness       was

 asked about the help that removal of the perimeter fence                            might

 have been and wire cutters and he said that he did not see                            how

 the     fence       could have been removed but if he            had     known       that

 wire     cutters       were    available he would       have     thought       of     the

 removal        of the fence.        At Page 134A the witness said that                the

 wall at the base of the perimeter fence presents a                      substantial

 barrier       the    witness     said that had    the     fence       been     removed

people        would    have     been retained by the wall          there       was    the

problem then of people clambering over the dead and injured                            to

get     out which might have caused more vitalities.                    However       the

removal of the fence never crossed this witness’ mind.



At     Page     134 in cross-examination by Mr Maxwell                 this    witness

says that from the terrace he only began to get a view of                            what

had     happened       when he was about half way         down.         The    witness

says     that       the actions of numerous supporters on               the    terrace

was    magnificent.        They made comendable efforts to              resuscitate
people and rescue people.
With     Page 34 the witness was cross-examined by Mr Glasgow                         who

questioned          the     witness about tickets and         the    radial     fences

being     installed.            The witness agreed that the sterile            area      5

should always be free of fans.                  The witness agreed that if             all

the supporters on the terrace were from the same club it                            would

not     be seen as necessary to keep that sterile area 5                      sterile.

The     witness       was not aware however that at this              match     people

had occupied the no confinement side.                  The witness agreed             that

had     area 5 been sterile it would have provided a                    rat-run        for

people        to     get up to the back of the terrace but              the    Officer

did     not        know whether or not people had climbed              in     there     or

whether        they       had    been    in there   from     the    gradual     filling

progress from the start of the game.                  This at Page 136D.



The witness agreed that opening the gates in the radial                             fences

to     allow free access the whole section of the terrace                       negated

that particular rat-run.



At Page 137 Mr Glasgow deals with the changes in the layout                             of

the     ground and the possible changes of the numbering                       of     pens

but     it is complicated and I do not propose to deal fully                          with

it here.           If necessary reference can be made to Page 137.



At Page 138 Mr Glasgow deals with colouring of tickets and                             the

labelling of pens and turnstiles.                   At Page 139 Mr Glasgow            took

this     witness          through       an   actual bundle    of    tickets     and     in

considering           the       information on the ticket at         Page     139E     the

witness        said       "it    is clear to us,      but    to    several     numerous
supporters        it was not clear, because I was asked "where                         do     I

go?"



At Page 139F Mr Glasgow put to this witness the information                                  on

the     ticket        and asked him how could it be made                clearer?            The

witnessed        answered        "I     don't honestly know        because        I    think

people        as a matter of course, having read that information                            on

the     ticket, wish to confirm it."               At Page 140 the          information

on     the reverse of the ticket is considered and the                       clear          map

on     the reverse side is referred to and the witness said                            "that

is     right".        At Page 140D the witness says that the map on                         the

back     was not entirely correct in that on the diagram A, C                               and

B should have been shown which was different from the order                                  on

the     back     of     the     ticket.      At   Page     141    the    witnessed           is

questioned about the coloured squares at the turnstiles and                                  at

Page     141C the witness said you can see the yellow squares                               but

I think they should have been brown.                     Reference to       photographs

in     MWL/10/18A.            Then     the witness then says        that     he       didn't

think     anyone saw the squares on the walls.                    This witness             drew

several        persons        attention to the squares.          At Page      141          this

witness        identifies        the    grey haired club         official     as       being

Glasgow.

the enquiry adjourned until 10.00 am the following morning.

Witness       J     Morgan       recalled cross-examination       by     Mr    Glasgow

Continued/... Page 1



Continued          with   his     cross-examination      in     relation       to     the

coloured signs and agreed at Page 1G that in bundle one of                            the

West     Midlands         thin    bundle   of    photographs     and     looking       at

photograph          No.    6 and at 1G the witness says "it can               be     seen

quite        clearly in the photograph No. 6 the brown signs                   mounted

on     the    board below the yellow squares.            And at        Page    2A     the

witness agrees that the coloured signs with the labels                         written

on them were the right colours.                 And the witness continues            that

the letteringis pretty clear and the colours                   are right.



At     Page 2E, looking at the actual coloured tickets as                      opposed

to the black and white copies seen by the witness the                         previous

afternoon          the witness agreed that the tickets used on the                    day

correspond to the colours displayed on the squares.



There        is then discussion concerning the actual layout                   on     the

ticket       and the fact that the order on the               counterfoil          starts

with the seat number.



Page     3C, Mr Glasgow effectively states that the layout                     on     the

ticket        is    something to which thought could be given                  in     the

future.
Page     6E, during cross-examination by Mr Woodwood this                 witness

considered that more detailed enquiries ought to be put in hand

because        the    action   of   the   crowd   was   so   unusual       in     his

experience           that he would be interested to know       whether          there

was a concerted plan to approach the ground with the                     intention

of     forcing the Police hand, and surging into the               ground.         On

Page     6 the Officer then closed the enquiry about in excess                     of

100    people standing around on the concourse and on the                   bridge

in     front     of the sweet shop looking dejected and            resigned        to

missing the game.



It     appears        that these people did not in fact get in            and     the

Officer        thought     they might have missed to boat         and     had     not

acted promptly enough to get through the gate.



At Page 7 it was this Officer's opinion that the Liverpool fans

had become wise to Police intentions at Page 7F he says that it

appeared to him that the fans decided in large numbers to                        stay

away until the last minute to avoid the situation of the Police

containing           them and then ushering them into the ground            at     an

early stage.



At     Page 10B this witness says that he had his radio                  with     him

but     did     not     use it because he did not want       to    add     to     the

traffic        on the air.     He also said in considering         whether        all

Police        Officers     down to PC rank should have       radios       and     his

opinion        was that the system would be swamped if that               was     the

case unless the Police had two or three control boxes.
Page     12F       having been asked about the conduct of some           of        the

fans and fighting to stay in the throng outside the                    turnstiles

and also fighting to get into the throng at the turnstiles this

witness        says     "all of the fans have been painted        whiter        than

whiter,        and     that   certainly was not the case.        We     were       not

approaching           the match to     deal with     a riot situation.We           were

approaching           the match to     deal with     a sporting event,and           the

crowd     at that time of the day          were      not sporting.       TheOfficer

did not consider the event to be unpolicable and said if                       there

had     been       20 PSUs in riot gear at that end of the        ground           the

match     would have been sorted but we were not approaching                       the

match     as       a riot". Pages 16, 17 and 18 discuss          the     position

where     this        Officer dealt with perimeter fence        and    there        is

discussion in relation to              this and the barrier which failed.                I

have      not analysed these pages sufficiently            to resolve              the

relative       positions to which the Officer and          Counsel       Woodwood

were referring to but if this becomes crucial these pages might

bear further examination.



At     Page 23 during this witnesses questioning by the Judge                      the

witness        states     "while     I was on the   concourse    there       was     a

barrier,       a      portable barrier, the three foot high           type     that

pegs     together, between the turnstile walls and the                 perimeter

gate.    These effectively separate Entrance A and Entrance C.                     My

serial was to supervise            turnstiles 9-16, but an official of the

club,    the fellow with the grey hair, came at an early stage and

moved     the        barrier to the right so that      people    entering           at

Entrance A, the turnstiles to the north stand, were able to use
turnstiles     1-10.      Turnstiles     11-16, however,   were    for    the

people     who were entering the west stand.         Two of my serial      in

fact     were on the opposite of the fence to the rest of the             men

under     my   command.     I   do not    know   whether   that   had    been

highlighted before but perhaps it helps".



The evidence of the witness Morgan is completed at Page 27.

Witness Police Constable Alison Tagg examined by Mr Phillips at

Page 27.



Constable Alison Tagg was in serial 17 on the day in                          question.

She    was     concerned with the turnstiles nearest to Gate                     A     the

first set of 8 or 10 turnstiles.                She was with P.C. Kirby.               She

was    part     of     the search operation and had            duty     to    maintain

orderly       queues.        The    Officers were    given      a     large     plastic

dustbin to put confiscated articles in.



This    Officer       observed       4   or 5   people   who     went        through     a

turnstile       and     handed a person who ducked           down     behind.          The

evidence       of     this   witness is completed at           Page     38     and     the

evidence       that     she gave did not add any         information           to    that

which has already been described here.

Witness       Police Sargent Lionel Proctor called and               examined          by

Mr. Collins at Page 38.



Witness       Police Sargent Lionel Proctor was in charge of                    serial

19.      He     had       a roving commission outside the         gates       and     his

serial        was nearer to the ground outside the sweet shop in                      the

area that leads from the turnstiles to the Leppings Lane Road.



This     witness gives evidence of his serials action                    in     seeping

out     people without tickets who were asking ticket                    holders       if

they'd        got     spare    tickets.       The   sweep   was   made        with    the

assistance of mounted officers.                 The witness said that           towards

2.00     pm     there were hundreds of people gathering on                    the    foot

paths, over the bridge, sitting on the bridge, on both sides of

the     road        and    they were preventing the         people   who       had    got

tickets from walking down the footpaths and people had to                            walk

into the road.


 The    Officer refers to 4 or 5 hundred individuals and                       many     of

 them     returned again after they'd been swept out.                 At Page          40A

 this     Officer         volunters     the    information     concerning           people

 asking where do they go "if they put a turnstile letter at                            the

 top     left       hand     corner in large letters I am         sure     that       will

 solve        their       problem".    This Officer     was    referring        to     the

 printing actually on the tickets.
This   witnesses     evidence   is completed at Page 50    and    in   my

opinion   does     not add anything new to that which     has    already

been set out here.

                                   WEDNESDAY 7TH JUNE, 1989 MORNING SESSION



Witness        Police Constable Jane Burnlees called and examined                by
Mr Phillips at Page 50.



Police Constable Jane Burnlees was serving in serial 19 on                      the

day in question, her Sargent was Sargent Proctor she had served

on     match duty on three previous occassions, she had served                   at

Lepping Lane's area before on two occassions but had not served

at a semi-final.           She was serving in the immediate area of             the

turnstiles           on the Lepping Lane's side of the perimeter           fence.

Her serial walked right up to Catchbar Lane keeping the fans on
the pavement.



She    said         that her serial was approached by      far    more     people

asking        for     tickets     than we actually   stopped     and    asked   to

produce tickets.



This witness says at Page 51 that at 1.3 0 pm a large number                    of

people        appeared     from    nowhere it was    getting   quite      crowded

outside the ground and the Police tried to sheppard them in but

they were reluctant to do so and they were hanging about on the

bridge and asking if the pubs were open and where they could go

they did not take the Police advice to go into the ground.                      At

Page     52     it    appeared to this witness that       there    were     large

groups        of 30 or 40 people the Police thought must           be     selling
tickets and they caused these crowds to disperse.          They did not

catch    anyone   selling tickets.   At Page 53     the   witnessed     is

called to Gate A to help shut the gate.         It had been opened      to

ease    congestion.   This at about 2.4 5 pm.     She can not be      sure

of the time.



Cross-examined     at Page 54 by Mr Glasgow the witness said          that

the people asking her to tell them where they could get tickets

at about          did not move away completely she kept seeing the
same faces.



This witnesses evidence is completed at Page 56 without any new

evidence being added.

Witness Sargent Phillip Sidney Smith called and examined by                                   Mr

Collins at Page 57.



Sargent           Phillip Sidney Smith is a Merseyside Officer                       and     was

one     of        the        mounted    officers      seconded     to   assist        at     the

semi-final              at     Hillsborough.       He was posted at      the     Lepping's

Lane, Liverpool end.                   There were 10 mounted officers altogether

from Liverpool.                A Police inspector, the Sargent witness and                     8

officers.           He has seven years experience on mounted duties                          and

has     attended 300 or more than 300 football matches over                                those

seven        years.              At    Page    58 this   officer    thought          that the

turnstile area at Lepping's Lane was not ideally designed                                  with

static barriers if Police horses were going to be used.                                Police

horses           needspace to move the horses into.              At Page        60A         this

witness           speaks        about a lot of confusion "people           had        tickets

with         a    certain letter on and the turnstiles                  weren't       marked

with that letter" and he spent a lot of time between 2.00pm and

2.3 0 pm answering queries as to where people should go with the

tickets          but          there was still no problem until 2.30 pm.                    This

Officer said                 that the passage through the turnstiles                 seemed        to

be     much slower than he would have expected for an                          all     ticket

match where no money was being handed over.



At Page 69D the witness says "I think the problem was                                although

we    monitored the people going through the perimeter gate                                into

the turnstile area it became a steady flow going through there,
but    they were then slowed up because of the slowness of          going

through    the   turnstiles, and that created   a   build-up    inside

that   area".    At Page 69 with the witness Smith still       in     the

witness box the enquiry adjourned for lunch.

Witness Police Constable Stephen Frank Fry called and       examined

by Mr Collins at Page 74.



Police Constable Stephen Frank Fry is a Merseyside Officer with

duties to patrol the Halifax Road area awaiting the arrival       of

the   special train with Liverpool fans.   He was with     Constable

Radford.   After escorting the train fans he was called by radio

to return to Lepping Lane's turnstiles shortly after 2.15 pm as

the   situation was becoming difficult to manage.   This    witness

was a mounted Officer.



The evidence of this witness added nothing and was completed at
Page 79.

Witness        Police     Constable     Grunnill   called     and    examined        by-

Mr              at      Page 9.



Police Constable Grunnill is with Merseyside Mounted Police and

has     been      mounted      officer    for 30 years. He      has    a lot         of

experience in sorts of            crowd situations and football             matches,

he     was     with     Sargent Smith and Constable     Stanbridge          at      the

turnstile         end of the Leppings Lane ground thewhole time.                     At

Page     80C    this witness      said with regard to the       speed        of     the

turnstiles        into the ground "I am used to Anfiled and                 Goodison

and     the      slowness was what amazed me.         In my    opinion it           was

slower than Anfield when they take money" it went slow from the

start.         The searching of fans tended to slow it down                 as     well

and a group of boys or youths going towards the gates                       together

if     somebody       is pulled to one side to be searched            then        their

friends        go with them and this starts to create a             bottle         neck

around        the gate.     At Page 84D this Officer assisted           a        Police

Constable       that      was trying the shut the blue        perimeter           gate.

The perimeter gate was successfully closed.                 At Page 85A           there

was a further surge and the gates were forced open (I think the

blue     perimeter gate).         This witness evidence is          completed        at

Page 87 and added nothing to the evidence already set out.

                             WEDNESDAY 7TH JUNE, 1989 AFTERNOON SESSION


Witness       P.C. Elizabeth Jane Wilson called and examined                   by      Mr

Collins at Page 88.



P.C. Elizabeth Jane Wilson is with the South Yorkshire                         Mounted

Branch with nine years service and has policed football grounds

all those in the South Yorkshire District including many                            times

Hillsborough         and   has      policed Hillsborough in       a     full        house

certainly       in    excess      of 40,000 to   45,000      at   Leppings           Lane

before.       She had an inexperienced force on this occassion.



This    Officer gives evidence of two fights taking                   place         which

held people up getting to the ground and she observed a lot                            of

people affected by drink, she did not think her horse would                            be

able     to    cope with         the congested mass ofpeople close             to     the

turnstiles       and so she worked at the back of the crowed                    trying

to calm people.



At     Page    91 this witness gives evidence           of      seeing    Inspector

Ellis     on    the    top     of     the   LandRover     but     she    could        not

distinguish the words a matter of feet away from him and                            could

certainly       not hear         what he was trying toshout.          Although        her

hearing is affected              to some extent by thehelmet she wears.
At Page 92 this witness gives evidence that she      was quite     sure

that she heard a message that the     game would be delayed and she

shouted   this    information to thecrowd.   She   shouted    to   the

crowd that the game had been delayed until 3.30 pm she believed

what she was saying.



Again at Page 92 this Officer gave evidence of 100 or so youths

on   the bridge who appeared to be the people of the         non-ticket

holder section.

Afternoon Session - page 93

Witness E.J. Wilson cross examined by Mr Hytner.




At     page 93 this witness gives evidence that between 2.20pm and

2.30pm with the start of the train escort already going through

into        the turnstile terrace area she was shocked at the                  amount

of     people       coming        from Catchbar Lane.    There   was     perhaps     a

thousand or possibly two thousand people moving down there.



At page 94 cross examined by Mr Kallipetis.                   This officer gives

evidence          of receiving a radio message to the effect that there

was     a    possible pitch invasion.           The turnstile area was           clear

before        she with other mounted officers left the turnstile area

and    was        detailed to Penniston Road and on reaching              Penniston

Road she heard of a vast number of fatalities inside the ground

from        the    west      stand.     She   thinks    she   heard     this     later

information          from     a    mounted officer who had been         inside     the

ground       to    enquire.        This officer's evidence is         completed     at

page 96.

Afternoon Session - page 96

Witness       Sergeant William Cameron Crawford called and                  examined

by Mr Phillips.




Sergeant       William      Cameron Crawford was in charge of serial                 14

whose     duties were on the ground side of turnstiles A-G                      inside

the     turnstiles.         His     duties were     general     searching       powers

inside the ground.             He also had duties to maintain order on the

terraces.           He   would have gone onto the terraces             through      the

tunnel if required by ground control.



At     page        97 this witness gives evidence that at 2.00pm he                 had

been     through the tunnell and looked at the terraces and                       there

was no problem thereafter he was busy at the turnstiles and did

not     at any stage receive any information about the terraces or

need     to go to the terraces.             At page 97E this officer says            in

response        to a question "If you had been told that pens 3 and 4

were     getting overcrowded, what would you have done about                       it?"

The      witness         answered      "I    do   not   think    that       was      my

responsibility.            I   would probably have assisted the             stewards

there.         I    think that is their responsibility.            I    would      have

assisted        them.      However, of course, our match          control         would

have been aware of the problem".
At     page     98 this witness says if he had received                  instructions

from     match        control he would have expected to be               deployed      on

the terrace by match control.



At     page 98F this witness said that he saw money being                     offered

at     the     turnstiles,          £10   notes and £5   notes     but    they       were

covering        them with the palm of their hand.            Asked whether            any

of     the     turnstile operators spoke to this officer about it                      he

said     "they        said    "he     has no ticket" but, of       course,       I    was

flitting between the turnstiles A to G and it was obvious to me

that     when     I    was     standing there inside      the      turnstiles         the

operators        had     a look round to see if I was there and said                   he

has     no     ticket".       This officer took them into the            ground       and

then ejected them.



At     page     99D    this witness says that he had gate C               opened       to

eject        people    on quite a lot of occasions.              Challenged        about

this     activity        and that such people should have been taken                   to

the     police room and got them fitted out with an ejection                         slip

he     said that that was the normal procedure but that if he                         had

done     that     his serial would have been seriously              depleted          and

there would have been no police officers the turnstiles if they

had     complied       with the instructions.        That situation          did      not

become        apparent       until    well after quarter past two          and       this

officer       took     it upon himself to eject the people as it was                    a

practicable way of dealing with the situation.



At     page 100 this officer give evidence on drink to the                       effect
that     the        nearer kick off time came the air reeked a lot                             more

with     intoxicating liquor particularly beer.                       At page 100H this

officer        gives           evidence      that turnstile G had       been        adversely

affected           by the distortion of a dividing wall by the                          pressure

of     fans        and the turnstile because of this could                    not        operate

properly           it     was turning round with some difficulty and                          there

was     traces           of     paint on the actual wooden block              and        it     was

restricting access in the turnstile.



On     page        10 IE       it     is   suggested that     this    can     be        seen     on

photograph              10.         This   officer   kicked    it    several        times        to

endeavour to free it but it was still restricting access.                                      This

timing        was nearer quarter to three.                  At page 102F this witness

says     that           his radio signal was a bit non-existent                    he     didn't

know why.           At page 103B this officer said that he tried several

times     through the day to operate the radio but it did not seem

to     work.       At page 103F this officer says that there were a lot

of     people going over the wall on to the roof of the                             turnstile

building           and        his     officers   were grabbing       those     people           and

ejecting           them        through     gate C.   The officer did not                see     any

tickets.            This        officer      saw tickets being       handed        back        from

inside        to outside the ground and handed from a man inside                                the

ground        to        someone        on the roof who dropped them down                to      the

other side of the turnstiles.



At     page 104G this officer said that he had no warning that the

gate     would           be opened and left opened for the influx of                          fans.

This I believe referring to gate C.                     At page 106 gives evidence
of one of his serial, PC Washington, telling him that there was

a     message to go on to the perimeter track and the witness took

his     serial        on to the field via the south stand                behind           match

control.



The witness says there were a lot of people shouting for oxygen

but     there       was none available to his knowledge.                 At page           107E

cross-examined             by     Mr Hytner the witness says "there were                    not

any     stewards           apart from the bottom of the stairs to the                      west

stand, and of course there was one steward on gate C".



At     page     113H       cross examined by Mr Jackson there              is        further

inference           that    a number of operators were taking payment                       but

nothing        absolutely positive.                He says "I had briefed the              lads

on     my serial to watch out for this and they were keeping extra

vigilance           and    watching out for that and to see if, in                    actual

fact,     I could catch them out".



At      page        114    cross        examined    by   Mr   Muller.     The        witness

questioned          about        the     filling of the pens.      He    said        it    was

self-regulating             and        when   it was put to him that       this           could

lead     to     overcrowding in that area the witness said                      "I        think

this     is     a    problem for the stewards again but,                you     know,         I

cannot        comment       on     that."     At page 118B      this    officer           gives

evidence        that he had earpiece (like a deaf aid) from his radio

but     he did not know whether it was general issue but is issued

to a number and it enables him to pick up actual radio messages

over an above the noise.
At     page        118        the       witness Crawford is           cross-examined          by     Mr

Glasgow           in     particular about money being offered to                           turnstile

operators              and his implication that if the operator saw that he

was nearby then they did not accept it but presumably if he was

not     nearby           then the inference was that they would accept                              it.

In     cross-examination the witness at first appears to be                                       going

away        from this suggestion but then at 119C he says again                                    that

that was the impression he got.



At     page        119E reference is made to this witness' statement                                 in

which        he        says       "I     was paying      particular         attention        to     the

turnstiles             when it became apparent that a number of                            operators

were        taking          money".           The cross-examination           in     relation        to

turnstile           operators accepting money continued to page 121                                 and

at     no     time          was        the    officer able to         be    specific        and     the

inference          was left laying there.                     At page 122 this officer               is

asked       about           the closing of the tunnel in 1988 probably                            20-25

minutes           before          kick-off.         A PC Lang 1278 was the officer                 who

had an instruction to close the gate and page 122F this officer

did     not know but assumed that the order had been given because

the         centre            pens           were     full.      At        page      128      during

cross-examination                      by     Mr    Woodwood     this      witness     is         shown

photograph             28     in       the     South Yorkshire thick              bundle     and     in

response to the question "One can see on the terrace the affect

of     having removed the stanchions or the remains of                                 the        crash

barrier?"           and the witness answered "Yes, sir it (the                              majority

of     casualties) was directly in front of the crash barrier.                                       It
appears   to   be   pot holes there.   Right in front of   there   up

against   the wall is where the majority of the casualties were.

The evidence of the witness Crawford was completed at page 12 8.

Afternoon Session - page 128

Witness     Police Constable Paul Branston called and examined                          by

Mr Collins.




Police     Constable          Paul      Branston was part of serial         14        under

Sergeant Crawford.              He was on the turnstiles at the same end as

the     previous       year      when some fans had got in by         rushing           the

turnstiles       getting         over     the   top   of   the   actual     turnstile

mechanism.            He did not see the same thing happening this year.

He said there was not enough space outside for anybody to get a

run     at the turnstiles in order to get a foot on top of them to

get over.       A page 129D the witness confirms that he said in his

statement        "The     turnstiles are rather antiquated."                    Then     he

critisizes       the      part       that prevents the person       entering           only

extends        from     about     the height of about a person's            knees        to

somewhere       below      his       waist and when the crowd       built        up     the

ratchet mechanism could not operate when peopld were pressed up

against the rotating stile.                 He and other officers from time to

time     had     to     push     people back to give enough         slack        in     the

mechanism        for     the operator to be able to depress               the     pedal.

This officer confirmed the evidence of Crawford that one of the

turnstiles       was affected by part of the turnstile being                      forced

out     of line by the fans.              At page 131 the witness describes               a

small     piece of metal getting caught in the fly zip of                        persons
entering.            Also        on     page 131 the officer          gives        evidence        of

slowing        of        the turnstiles by arguments between                   stewards           and

people        trying           to come in about various things such as                      having

the wrong ticket for the area.                       Initially they were turned away

but     once the crush built up outside they had to be let in.                                    At

page     132B        the        officer gives evidence of             the     temptation           of

turnstile           operators to accept money but at 132C it appears                               to

me     that        the     officer           admits that he     did    not     actually           see

turnstile           operators           accepting the money.          At page        134F        this

witness        having           given        evidence concerning       somebody       who        was

trying        to     draw his attention from the terrace that there                              was

somebody           dead        at his feet a third or half way up the                      terrace

the     witness           says        he thinks the person was          somewhere           behind

where     he        later saw the crash barrier had collapsed.                        At        page

135E     the        witness           says     that the   man    gesticulating             to     him

apparently about a dead body was at about the right hand end of

where     the        end        stanchion is shown (presumably                of     the        crash

barrier        which failed) slightly behind rather than in front                                  of

the     barrier which failed.                    This witness' evidence in chief                   to

Mr     Collins           was     completed at page 135 where the                   enquiry       was

adjourned until 10.00am the following morning.

Morning Session - page 1

Witness       PC     Paul   Branston recalled and cross-examined         by     Mr

Hytner.




Mr     Hytner      cross-examined this witness in relation to the              two

briefings          he had prior to the match one mass briefing and then

one     smaller briefing for the two serials he was connected with

on the terraces.            The gates at the back of pens 3 and 4 leading

into the wing pens were pointed out to him and questioned about

evacuation procedures he said that two officers were deputed to

take     up     positions at those gates in the event of receiving                a

standard        message.      This officer in his briefing from Inspector

White     understood         the   Inspector   to mean   that   it   might      be

difficult          for the officers to take up their positions           because

if     people       were already making their way out via        those        gates

then     they would swimming against the tide.            He said the         gates

were     not       over large and not very well placed from one pen              to

another being right at the back of the terraces.



At     page 2 cross-examined by Mr Muller the witness was                further

questioned           with   regard to evacuation routes and      the     witness

agreed        that     there was some sense in having the gates          at     the

back     because        that would be the slackest part of the crowd             in

all probability.
At     page 8 was being cross-examined by Mr Glasgow.                   At page         8C

this    witness says that the turnstiles were working effectively

until     the     point    was   reached when there was            a    large        crowd

around      the     turnstiles       all    pushing   and    the       faults        "only

manisfested         themselves       when     there   was    pressure          on     the

turnstiles".



On     page 9 this officer was at the turnstiles in 1988 when                          the

turnstiles worked effectively, there was not the same pressure.

At     page 9D the officer agreed that he had been impressed                         with

the     turnstile        operators    on a number of        occasions         with     the

honesty     that he saw of those men rejecting bribes and                       drawing

the     officers'        attention to people trying to fiddle their                    way

in.      At page 13D this witness cross-examined by Mr Woodwood in

connection        with     the person on the terrace that              this     witness

made     eye contact with at or near the supposedly broken barrier

said     that     the     position    of this man would        be      difficult        to

pinpoint to any great accuracy.



The evidence of this witness is concluded at page 15.

Witness       Police Constable Jacqueline Burton called and examined

by Mr Phillips.




Police       Constable Jacqueline Burton was on serial 14 on the day

in     question with Sergeant Crawford.             She was behind turnstiles

A to G.        She was searching female fans.



This witness on page 15 and 16 gives evidence of the opening of

gate     C     on two occasions.       On the first occasion possibly        one

hundered        people coming through very rapidly.          The second batch

of     people       to come through gate C when the gate was        opened     a

second time came             through more slowly.



At     page 17 this          witness gives evidence of having gone onto the

pitch.         She understood there had been a pitch invasion.            This

witness        helped     people who had been injured in the pens.           She

was     looking       into    pen 3 from the left hand side of      the   goal

post.



At page 17 she describes             seeing a youth who appeared to be dead

still        held    up      by   the pressure of the crowd    in   a standing

position.
At     page        18 she describes looking towards the back of the                            pen

and        seeing        fans        who     had obviously    not     realised         what    had

happened still shouting for the football to begin, clapping and

cheering.               At     this     time       she believed     the   match        had    been

stopped.



Whilst        this witness was giving assistance she was just                            missed

by     a     large       pole which had been thrown over the                  fencing.          It

appears          that         this     is    the    pole   that     has   been     previously

described as being thrown over.



At     page 20 the officer gives evidence that once she was on the

pitch        she        received no orders and worked entirely on                       her    own

initiative.                  At pages 22 and 23 the officer gives evidence                      of

people        coming           through or over the turnstiles without                   tickets

and        she observed tickets being passed back out of the                             ground.

She        estimated           that 50 or 60 youths came through with                   tickets

that       had      been passed back out of the ground.                   That number           in

addition           to        those    that got through        the     turnstiles        without

tickets.



At     page        24        in cross-examination by Mr             Glasgow      the    witness

Jacqueline              Burton        felt     between the two openings           of    gate     C

hostility           and        agression        being directed against           her    by     the

people        coming           in and also against stewards with their                   yellow

tabards in the ground.



This witness' evidence is completed on page 25.

Witness Police Constable Paul Branston re-called.




At   page 26 he gave evidence that the witness was working            very

close     to        the south corner of pen 3 and he could see dead    and

injured        at    the other side of the radial fence right into     the

corner     quite close to that radial fence.        This   re-examination

by the Judge of the witness Branston is completed on page 26.

Witness Sergeant Robert Burns examined




Sergeant       Robert Burns was in charge of serial 15 on the day in

question.        It was the serial located behind turnstiles 9 to 16.

this      witness        deals    with   some   apparent   confusion    in     the

Operational Order as to whether this witness is responsible for

turnstiles        1     to 16 or 9 to 16, the position is        clarified      on

page     27.     At      page 28D this witness Burns        recalls    Inspector

White     saying during briefing that if he had another serial                  he

would     have        made alternative plans for the patrolling          of    the

terraces.        This officer connected the Inspector's comments with

emergency evacuation procedure which was being described at the

time     he      made     the remark. There was nothing said          about    the

possible        overcrowding       in the pens.    At page 30H and page        31A

this    witness         compliments the turnstile operators and said            "I

have     nothing        untoward    to say about these      people    (turnstile

operators).           These men did work magic.      They worked with me and

we     both    worked together.          This witness ordered the      turnstile

operators        to let people through to do the best they could               and

a lot of        non-ticket holders went through.           This at page 31.



At     page      33B in connection with the opening of the gates               this

witness        says     that     "the two stewards on that     gate    (gate    B)
( "I
remonstrated against opening it".                      At page 33 this officer gave

evidence           that   his       radio had been dead since               half        past     two

without        it     working and then he heard a message                        come     through

clear        for     all officers to go to the perimeter                     track.            Until

that     message          came through there was only               incoherent           message

chattering           and buzzing coming from the set.                  When this officer

received the message to go to the pitch he ensured that all the

outer        doors were closed by operators including turnstiles                                 and

gate     C     and he took his serial to the right hand side                              of     the

west     stand to a gate between gate B and gate C and he saw                                    two

youths        who had just come out of the middle tunnel in the mouth

of     the middle tunnel and one could hardly breath.                              They        asked

for     help       and said they were being crushed.                   At page           35     this

officer        appears         to    have lost his serial and               he     saw        people

fighting        their way back out of the terraces asking for air and

at     the     same       time people refusing to move               but         this officer

dragged        them       out into the tunnel.           At page 36              this officer

gives        evidence        of having rescued two youths who                    were on        the

ground        only     two        yards from the back of the               pen    with         other

spectators           still jumping up and down and shouting and                           jumping

onto them.           This only two yards down the pen.                     This at 36G.



At     page     44A though H in cross-examination by Mr Glasgow                                this

officer        speaks        in     praise of the co-operation               he     gets        from

turnstile          operators         and       stewards and says       any        steward       any

operator        will      do      what     I    tell   them.        This     at    page         44D.

and     estimated normal pass-through rate this witness says                                   that

he     became        concerned        for the majority         of     elderly       turnstile
operators          who     were   under    his control.         They    were    getting

agitated          and     frightened.     They were being harrassed,             shouted

at,    abused.           At page 47C still in response to              cross-examation

by    Mr     Glasgow the officer agreed that his responsibility                        for

the    centre           pens   was public safety and public order               and    the

greatest          fear for public safety is over crowding.                 The witness

said       "it     always      is so yes".       This at 47C.     At     page    50F    in

cross-examination              by Mr Woodwood this witness appears to clear

up     the        original doubt that I had that he might have lost                    his

serial       when        he went to the back of the terrace.              At    page     51

still        in        cross-examination        by Mr Woodwood at       page    5IF    the

witness           says     "it was like a pre-planned invasion of               a     large

amount            of     hooligans".      The    witness   Burns'       evidence       was

completed at page 52.

Witness Police Constable Helen Pearson called and examined                               by
Mr Phillips at page 2.


Constable           Helen Pearson was in serial 15 with Sargeant                     Burnes
behind the turnstiles at 9 - 16 Leppings Lane.                          she did not see
gate      B open but had to stand back to avoid being caught up                          in
the      rush of a sudden flood of people and she stood against the
wall      of     the turnstiles.             She would estimate that between            200
and      300     people came through they headed straight on from                       the
gate      and       she     assumed that they were going down               towards     the
north      stand.           The gate was closed.            Only a few minutes        after
that       she        was       aware     that   Sargeant    Burnes     instructed      the
turnstile           operators to close the doors.               She saw the turnstile
operator         on       her     turnstile do that.        Somebody told      her     that
there     had         been a pitch invasion but she and her                 serial     were
told     by      Sargeant Burnes to remain where they were.                    Prior     to
this she            had     seen        B gate open again     and     her   serial     come
through.


The area around her side of the turnstile was deserted.


This     officer          wandered with PC Martin to the back entrance                   of
the     tunnel        and saw a number of people coming down the                     tunnel
complaining           of being crushed inside.              At page 55 this     officer
says she went into pen 4 with Constable Martin.                         And from there
she saw a large number of fans climbing on the central dividing
fence     to        be pulled up by people who were in the seating                    area
above.     She could not understand why these people were climbing
up     because        that       were at the tunnel end in the mouth            of      the
tunnel.         This officer tried to stop them doing so because                       she
was     concerned           for the safety for those people and the              people
below.         At     page 55G she says that she pushed her way                 further
into     the pen and could then see officers at the front standing
on     the     fencing signalling for me to get people out             from        the
back     and so she tried to do that.           People refused to move             out
from     the     back there were some distressed people who did                   make
thier     way out and there were others who were co-operative.                      At
page 5 6C she says that she thinks the crush was starting at the
back of the pen where people were stood with their arms trapped
down by their sides they could not move, even at the back.                         She
then     went further down the pen with Constable Martin and found
a     worse situation and at 5 6G as she got in front of one of the
barriors        that joined the central dividing fence she came to                   a
pile     of     bodies.    At page 57C she identifies the        position           of
these     bodies "it is that barrior there that joins the                   central
dividing        fence where it says "Design A"" over halfway down and
it is the first one you come to.              Out of the tunnel if you keep
to     the fence itself.       A pile of people was on the lower                 side,
the     pitch     side    of   the barrior.    At   page   58   this        Officer
directed        people,    fans,   moving bodies.     There were       no        other
police officers near her at that time.                The evidence          of     the
witness Pearson finishes at page 61.

         Witness Police Constable Alexander Aitkin called and                       examined
         by Mr Collins at page 61.



         Police Constable Alexander Aitkin was on serial 15.


         This     officer           gives   evidence of being at turnstiles 15 and           16
         (I     believe        inside       the turnstiles) at about 2.40 -        2.45pm        a
        young        PC      came     running round saying we havegot to       open        the
        gate.          The     Steward      refused to open the gate and so I went           to
        the      gate.       The witness spoke to the young PC who again said he
        had     been instructed to come around here and open the gate                       and
        he      said      that the other gate had been opened meaning               gate     C.
        This     officer had first refused to have the gate opened because
        it would let people in who had no tickets but the young officer
        insisted          that      the     gate should be opened and it    was     opened.
        (The gate being referred to that the                    young     officer    wanted
        opened was gate B) .


        When the gate was opened about 200 fans got in and then officer
        Aitkin with PC Ford and Steward managed to shut the gate again.
        At page 63A the officer said that those that went through                           he
        thought would go up to 5 & 6 pens.


        This     witness did not receive any message or instruction to                      go
        to     the     pitch        but at page    63D the witness says     that     he was
        walking        towards        the directionwhere the people had       gone         who
        went     through         gate B when         .....   came running out        of    the
        tunnels        through the middletunnel towards the gate in                 the wall
        and     shouted        to     the witness and PC Ward "you want to          get     in
        there        it is bedlam".          This officer thought there was        fighting
        so he ran up the tunnel and saw one or two coming out saying we
        are     getting crushed in their.             The witness saw Sargeant Burnes
        already        trying        to move people out from the back down          to     the
tunnel and some would not move.


At    page 64 the officer moves into pen 3 and when he is 3, 4 or
5 yards in he saw a lad on the ground.        The witness at page 64C
identified        on the plan "perhaps the first crash barrior as you
come in down here just in that area".        At page 64H this officer
eventually got to the stage where he was helping people through
one    of the perimeter gates at page 65 being cross examined          by
Mr    Hytner at page 65G this officer gave evidence of looking at
his    watch at 3.02pm which was prior to the fan running out           of
the tunnel to say that there was bedlam inside.         At page 69D in
respect      of    this officers evidence when he reached the end       of
the    tunnel and said he saw "a sea of bodies" this was in           fact
not a sea of bodies but a sea of people.


At    page 7 0G as to the direction the people went once they          had
passed      through gate B the witness says that I went towards the
north       stand, if they had wanted they could have made their way
to    the     tunnel   but   the majority of the flow   went   that    way
towards the north stand.


This witness completed his evidence at page 71.

Sargeant        Paul Burman was in charge of serial 13 on duty in the
west     stand.            The witness Burman gave evidence       of     complaints
being     made        by     Liverpool fans well before 2.00pm          that        they,
Liverpool        should        have,    by right the larger top        end     of     the
ground and it appeared to him that there pride was hurt by them
not     having it.           One of this officers duties was to stop people
from climbing up from the terraces into the west stand.                         And at
page     71H     this officer described the pens at the front of                      the
west     stand as being full at 2.00pm.             Full but not to bursting.
The     pen     appeared        to fill quicker than pen 4.        For       instance
about        2.00pm        when the first of several fans climbed onto                the
wall he was the first of several and when this officer told him
to     get     down the response he got was that he was told to                      fuck
off     with a stipulation in keeping.             This prompted the           officer
to     go down through the tunnel onto the terraces with a view to
getting        the man.        He walked out of the west stand through                the
tunnel,        the     central tunnel leading into the pen but he                   could
not get into the pen 3 and this was just after 2.00pm.                         This at
page     72E.        The officer could hav forced his way in but he                   did
not     wish     to do so alone.          AT page 73 IMPORTANT — A &           B     this
officer        gives evidence of seeing two youths on a barrior - the
 barrior being             the one that eventually collapsed, he saw a youth
 standing       on         the barrior supported by other youths around               him
 singing        and encouraging others to sing and chant and generally
 jumping        up    and down on top of the barrior.         At the same            time
 another youth was climbing on the right side of the barrior                             and
 diving       into         and onto the heads of those in front of him.                   He
 did     this        ten or twenty times.       This at page 73D this          conduct
 stopped        about        2.15pm    when somebody remonstrated with             him      -
 another fan.              This officer changed his radio between 2.00pm and
2.15pm       because it was not working correctly, he only got a lot
of crackling.         He saw the pen get fuller.         Asked whether he was
aware    that        there was a limit, a safety limit, on the         numbers
that     should be in those pens the witness said that he presumed
there    would        be   but   what   it is he   did    not   know   and   his
experience       was that at football matches for some reason people
want     to assemble in compact numbers in the centre of the                 back
of     the    cop.     He did not think it was necessary for him to            do
anything positive about what he was seeing.


At page 7 4 the enquiry adjourned for lunch.

Witness          Sargeant Paul Burman was re-called and re-examined                        by
Mr Collins at page 75.



At page 7 6E this officer says that for the last five minutes or
so     prior to kick off he was heavily involved in moving up                             and
down       the     front row of the stand stopping people standing                        up.
Of the people climbing up nobody made any complaint of any form
of distress.            The witnesses opinion was that they were climbing
up     out       of there to gain access to the seated area.                     This      at
page 7 6E.


At     page        7 6G the witness says that something had                   happened     of
which         he    was       not        aware    which caused     people,      fans,      to
remonstrate            with    him        saying     do something.      Do      something.
People          are going to be killed in there.                   These were the people
sitting          in the front of the west stand.                   This witness at       page
7 7B       looked into the pen but could see nothing other than                          what
he     had seen earlier the pen was full and he could not see what
the problem was.               At this stage the game was still going on and
this witness saw people start to climb over the perimeter fence
onto       the track.          But this officer thought that it was a                   pitch
invasion.           He did     not realise that people were being crushed in
the pens.           People were saying to the officer get something done
and he was saying what has happened but he did not get an answer
that       he      understood.            At     page 7 8   this    witness    ..........
Inspector Builas and PC Frost who were looking down into pens 3
&      4   who were both trying to get through on their radios                           this
officer          was looking down into the pen just to the right of the
tunnel          entrance.           It    was not until this witness           saw     bodies
being        carried      out        onto the track that he became             aware     that
people          were    being crushed.             This officer did not receive           the
message          "all officers onto the pitch" at page 7 9E this officer
was        aware       of the stewards having taken off their jackets                     and
the   witness   spoke to one of the chief stewards after   it   had
mainly    cleared.   (The transcript does not elicidate was passed
between    this witness and the Chief Steward).   At page 81D this
officer gave the opinion that control of the numbers of fans in
the pens was the duty of the stewards.    At page 82F the officer
said that he was not aware of any specific briefing which might
prevent an emergency due to overcrowding.


At page 86 this witnesses evidence is concluded.

Witness Police Constable Steven Shearwood called examined by Mr
Phillips.



Constable           Steven Shearwood on the serial with Sargeant                 Burman
serial        13     involved        in the west stand.     He was at     the     south
entrance           to the level of the west stand.          With WPC Fairclough.
They     were instructed to remain within the stairwell area                          half
way     up     the        stairs.      At paragraph   86G    this   witness       gives
evidence           that     he was beckoned to the bottom of the stairs                 by
the     stewards to the area in the yard to the left hand side                          of
the     tunnel.           And the officer arrested one person and took him
to     the police room.              He was away for approximately 10           minutes
(this        had occured at approximately 2.30pm) and the police room
decided that the person should be ejected which occured and the
witness returned to the west stand area.


At     page        87 the witness gives evidence that he saw              the     brief
opening of gate C and at 87E the witness says that he could see
that     the stewards were having great difficulty because of                          the
opening        of     gate C.        The stewards closed one of the gates              and
five stewards were standing behind that gate trying to restrict
the     flow        of fans through just to the right hand              side.         This
officer        and        the WPC tried to instil some more order.              And     at
87F     the    witness says that he was quite surprised that                     rather
than     arguing          with      people   the stewards   were    allowing          them
upstairs into the west stand.                 At page 88 the witness Shearwood
gives evidence of a middle aged man coming from the tunnel area
who     told        him that he had come out of the west stand, the                    man
was     hysterical and said that people were dying in there.                           The
officer        then became pinned against a metal gate but after 2 or
3     minutes he made his way to the hysterical man who again told
him     that        he had heard that children were being flattened                    and
the     witness was warned by the WPC not to go further and he was
then   approached      by a young man who said he was injured.          And
this   officer     took   the lad who complained of   injury       to   the
gymnasium      area.   To the first aid point.   Both the witness and
the WPC.      At this time there were still people coming from gate
C   but that area was not seriously congested then.          The   people
from   gate     C were not going down the tunnel.     This     witnesses
evidence was completed at page 91.

Witness Police Sargeant Edward Higgins called and examined                              by
Mr Collins.


Sargeant          Edward        Higgins     was in cahrge of serial       20     reserve
serial.            In         the      gymnasium.   And    his   serial         received
instructions             to go to Leppings Lane end because of trouble                  at
the        turnstiles.              He went to gate A.    He saw 50 or     60    youths
urinating all the way along from the outside of the stand right
up     to     gate A but told his unit not to arrest anybody                    and     he
then        saw the problem at gate A.              This witness radioed for gate
A     to     be   opened because he thought someone              might    be     killed
outside and he knew that his message was received.                        He received
an     answer from Superintendent Marshall that he should open the
gate.        This officer made preparations with his unit and delta 2
to     receive          the    people      in thorugh gate A.    At   page      93     the
witness said he gave the steward, the gate man, instructions to
open        the   gate.        This steward was not willing to follow                those
instructions initially and the Sargeant had to remonstrate with
the steward for sometime before he even decided that he                           would
be opening the gates.

Witness Police Sargeant Peter Chapman called and examined                                   by
Mr Phillips at page 95.



Sargeant           Peter Chapman was the Sargeant in charge of serial                        1
on     the perimeter track.                At page 95F this witness said that he
attended           the briefing for supervisory officers and "the job of
the people on the perimeter track, sir, is up until kick off to
stand     and face the crowd paying particular attention to people
trying        to     climb        over the perimeter fences".          He     had        never
allocated          particular           officers   to   particular     gates        in     the
perimeter          gate        and officers automatically go to             those        gates
only     if        the evacuation procedure is put in hand.                 At page         97
reference           is    made      to a bundle of documents         South     Yorkshire
Police        volume 1 tab 14 sub sector 1 serial 1 is the order sent
to     all members of serial 1.                The instructions to this             witness
was     that       he should stay at the bottom of the players                      tunnel.
The      13        regulars        of    the   serial   had   radios    the     six       who
supplemented              the serial did not have radios.            The witness           did
not     instruct his men to watch out for overcrowding at page 98.
At page 100 the witness says that the first he knew of anything
wrong     was "overspill" at the Leppings Lane end just after                              the
game     had kicked off.                The witness was very vague about what he
meant     about           an     overspill but said that the fences            could        be
scaled.        After           the game had been stopped the witness                Chapman
still stayed at the players tunnel.


At     page 100 cross examined by Mr Gibson Watt the witness                              said
that     he    was the officer who took the two managers, Mr                        Clough
and     Mr Delgleash to the police control room and Superintendent
Duckensfield              told     them there was a serious incident on                  their
hands.        As         far as this officer was aware no            explanation          was
given     to either manager as to how or why it had happened.                               At
page     101 the witness is cross examined by Mr Glasgow who                             drew
the     officers attention to the only section in of the match day
orders        were those relating to access not being allowed to                             the
track        without     permission of the senior officer or to                        receive
medical attention.              That was an alteration.            And new.


At     page     102     Mr Glasgow put it to the witness said                       that     his
serial        should     have        been     warned   to   keep     a    look       out     for
overcrowding           but     the       witness did not give way on             the       point
because he said that it was part of the whole releasing package
of     the football match that they do so without being told.                                 At
page     102B        & C Mr Woodward opens his cross examination of                          the
witness        Chapman obtaining his agreement that this was a                           match
being        put on by the Football Association, it was their                           event,
it     was     at Sheffield Wednesday's club, they had organised                             it,
and     the police had come along to assist.                   It was put that               the
police were vitulant and this officer said they were.                               They had
not     failed        to carry anything out.           At page 104D           the      witness
says that he had a discussion with Mr Lock at the bottom of the
tunnel        (players        tunnel) and Mr Lock had told this                  officer       a
figure        of how many spectators were in the ground.                      The officer
could        not then recall that figure but Mr Lock did tell him                             it
was     absolute        hell on the outside in Leppings Lane and                        police
control        did     know     about it.        That was at       2.39pm.          Inspector
Harvey       was also present during the Lock conversation.                            At page
105     this        witness     says in respect of the words in                  the     order
"without        consent       of     a      senior officer" that         in   the       police
service        he     considered that senior officers are thought to                          be
Inspector and above.               At page 105F this witness agreed that not
having        a specific briefing about opening the gates did.                             This
officers evidence is completed at page 106.

Witness Police Constable Peter Smith called and examined by Mr
Collins at page 106.


Peter        Smith was on serial 1 and under Sargeant Chapman on                        the
day     in question.            And had done this particular perimeter                 duty
on     numerous occasions before.              He is a community officer.                He
had a radio.     He was at the rear of the goal                      mouth       at     the
Leppings Lane end also in 1987 and 1988.


Asked        if he would go           into the stands to deal with fighting in
the     stands        he    said       no it was something     he    would        pass to
control.         He said that overcrowding or potential                   overcrowding
was     something          that       is permanently monitored.           He    would be
looking        for     people in difficulty.           This officer said that            in
the past with overcrowding we have gone through on the radio or
let     people out and moved them to another part of the terracing
should         that        be    necessary.     This     officer    had    seen         the
operational           order but the emphasis in it had not be brought to
his     attention          until this enquiry.         He meant the fact that            it
was     in     capitals         this year and last year it         was    not.         This
officer        did     not agree with his Sargeant that it was                  full     at
2.00pm this officer went for his meal at 2.00pm and returned at
about        2.50pm.       PC Helliwell took over from him while he was at
his meal.        At page 112D the witness says that at some stage the
gate     of     pen 3 actually flew open of its own accord.                     At     page
113 the witness looks at the photograph                   South Yorkshire Police
document 10 photograph No 4                 which is a picture of the mechanism
the     officers       view is that         under pressure     thegate will            open.
At pag 113E the officer says                  that when the   gatopened he walked
back    and      closed         it.   The   crowd had gone    backand          they    were
stood there. There was nobody pressing on that fence when                                he
closed the gate.

Continuation             of evidence of P.Smith examined by Mr.Collins              at
page 114.




This     witness says that he saw gate 3 open again due to a surge

forward        during a kickabout.             The witness said that people were

shouting        and screaming as they surged forward but that was not

unusual.            He    could        not   recall   what   they   were    shouting.

This     witness concluded, held the gate 2 for a very short space

of     time,        things were very confused and he did not               think the

gate     was        ever shut again. He left two officers             holding      the

gate     to and set back to look in and he could see people                      being

pressed        up   tight        against     the fence and this was        ...     for

kick-off.                He    then heard people shouting 'open the gates we

are crushed' and things like that.



Page 114.

This officer climbed up onto the advertising holdings and waved

to    the people in the pen to move back but got no response                      and

the     officers              opened     the    gates.       This   officer      took

responsibility for opening the gates.

The witness said that he thought that the gate in the perimeter

track     of       the     fence     only opened to        a    right-hand   angle    he

thought,       because of the advertising holding boards stopping it

opening any further but he was not sure.

The question of officers having been in a state of shock having

This     officer          says     that he was    aware that there      were     safety

limits       for the spion kop, for the Leppings Lane terraces,                      for

the west stand, but he did not know limits for individual pens.

 Witness - Police Constable Gerrard Finnegan.




 Called and examined by Mr.Phillips at page 125.



 Constable      Gerrard      Finnegan    was     on serial      1   with   Sergeant

 Chapman and this officer's station was with Sergeant Chapman at

 the    player's tunnel.        At the very beginning of his evidence he

 speaks    of     a    fan   standing on one of         the    barriers    throwing

himself into the crowd at 2.30.                This in pen 3.       The barrier he

was stood on was near to the back.               The person throwing himself

was     throwing      himself to the right.        The fan did this         two    or

three     times while this witness was watching him.                 The    witness
said this often happens.



Page 126E.

The    witness says that at nineteen minutes to three o'clock                      he

turned    to     Sergeant      Chapman   and     said    "where     are    all    the

Liverpool       supporters".     He had noticed that the centre pen was

filling       up but the pens either side appeared reasonably empty.

The    west     stand    and   the   north stand        also    appeared    to    be
reasonably empty.



Page 127C.

This    officer       was asked what he understood by the word              'over-
                                                -5-


        spill'     (this was a word used by a previous witness without the

        witness ever being able to find what he meant).             In response to

        this     question     the    witness   P.C.Finnegan said    "not    a    pitch

        invasion.       People      .were obviously or possibly in distress        and

        wanted     to   get   onto the track out of the way        into    the    side
        pens".



        Page 128B.

        The witness said that in 1981 he had seen a similar overspill.

Witness Police Constable David Illingworth.




Called and examined by Mr.Collins at page 130.



Witness        Police Constable David Illingworth was on serial 1 and

his     position was at about gate 5 to the right of the goal when

looking at it.           Effectively between gates 4 and 5.           At page 135

sometime        after     2.50    this witness became       aware    that    people

became     distressed and he realised they were in pain and he put

a     radio message over to say that there was a serious situation

at the front.           This at page 135C.         The people were in pen 4 and

were     shouting for help.          This witness opened the gates at page

135E.     The gate he opened was that to pen 4.              His intention was

to     remove people out of gate 4 and put them into gate number 5

where     they       would   be    safe.     At page 36A   the    witness        gives

evidence        of    opening     gate 5 after having opened        gate     4    and

trying     to move people from gate 4 to gate 5.                 The witness left
the gate open.



Page 136.

The     witness is challenged.             Other evidence was that gate 4 was

closed     after it had been opened but this officer stuck to                     his

point     and    said that if it had been closed after he opened                   it

and     left    it open then somebody else must have closed                 it    and

when he left it open nobody was there to close it.                   He puts the
time   of    his opening of gate 4 and leaving it open at   between
2.50 and 2.55.



Page 138E.

The witness says that he did not know whether his radio message

was received by control.

Witness Police Constable Fiona Richardson.




Examined by Mr.Phillips at page 146.

Police Constable Fiona Richardson was in serial 1 on the day in

question       posted   to   the Leppings Lane end   of   the   perimeter

track.        She was on gate 1.



At     2.35    there were very few people on the terrace by her         and

she      thought     from the side view of terraces 3 and 4 that    they

were      much     fuller but not to capacity.   She did not     have    a

radio.



Page 140A.

This      witness says that she allowed people who had come out         of

gatenumber 3 back into gate 1.        These activities     had happened

before the game started.



Page 148E.

This witness gives evidence that she started pulling people out

of     gate 3.    She did not know why she was pulling people out or

what     had happened and then she saw faces with terror in pen 3.

There were other officers around her also pulling people out.



Page 149E.

This    witness     gives evidence of arguments that the crowd      were
                                 -9-


having   with   somebody she subsequently came to know was     Chief

Inspector   McSloy.    This officer was in plain clothes but      she

did not know why the crowd were arguing with him except that it

might have been that they did not know who he w a s .



The   enquiry   was adjourned to 10 am the following    morning   at
page 153.

The    witness     says    that   it was at 2.53 when    she    started   to

organise       people     into pen 1.   And she confirmed that     although

she    had originally thought that there was a club official that

the    crowd     were arguing with who it turned out to be a          police

officer      - Inspector McSloy.        The Inspector was trying to    move

the    people     along faster since she said the game was still          in

play    at that time.       He was not trying to push people back into

pens    3 or 4.     She then corrected the name McSloy and said that

the    correct name was McRobie.          The evidence of WPC    Richardson

finishes on page 3.

Police    Constable    David Illingworth recalled by   Lord    Justice
Taylor at page 3.



This    witness   in answer to the Judge's question said      that    he

found    it difficult to describe why he thought that people         got

into    difficulty    but said there appeared to be a more     serious

sway    that caused pressure on the front which was not relieved.

The re-examination of PC Illingworth was completed at page 4.

Police Constable James Packer called and examined by Mr.Collins
at page 4.



PC     James Packer was on serial 16 of D division.              This   officer

came     from the railway station and reported to the gymnasium to

receive        further     instructions   and      on his way   he   passed    by

Leppings        Lane     entrance outside at 2.45 to 2.46       when    another

officer        expressed    an opinion to him that they will never            get

that lot in there.          That was this officer's view as well.



Page 5.

This     witness       with others was deployed by Sergeant          Swift    the

track     at the Leppings Lane end to cover the front of the whole

of Leppings Lane and he thought because of public order in case

they tried coming over.



Page 5E.

This witness says that at about 3 o'clock he marched across the

front     of    the Leppings Lane end.           He saw there was    plenty    of

room in pen 5.         Pens 3 and 4 were chock-a-block and pen 2 again

there     was    plenty of room.     There was a lot of noise from            the

crowd     and    at page 5G this witness was aware of a man             in    the

middle     of the crowd saying there was somebody at his feet                 who

was     dead.     The gate to pen 3 was closed at that time, he               was

not    aware of whether the gate to pen 4 was open but it was not
                                          -13-


open when he walked passed it initially.



Page 6B.

At     the      witness Packer got to gate 2 and saw the man           who        was

talking         about adead man he turned to PC Taylor and         PC        Cooper

and     told         them to get the gate opened.    It was this       officer's

intention to          getsome fans out of gate 3 and     into    gate        2.

Both     Cooper and Taylor went straight away to gate 3 and opened

it.      Hethought         PC Smith   joined them.   As soon as        the    gate

opened        other     fans started to climb out over the gate.             Those

people who were walking he directed to pen 2 and those who were

not     walking        he was sitting them down against the side of               the

fence.        Some of them were struggling for breath.



Page 7C.

.....         the     line of officers across the pitch.        This     witness

says     that       when     fans were coming out a cameraman      was       being

attacked,           a press photographer and I helped drag him away from

some     of     the fans and took him to about the 18 yard line.                   It

was     an Inspector, he thinks Inspector White, who at about                     the

18     yard line and he said "stay here and make sure they do                     not

get    passed        here to prevent any public disorder".         There          was

hostility            fromthe fans.    Fans tried to run to the         directors

box and shouted            at F.A. officials and waived tickets and money.

They were shouting mostly about having been given the wrong end

of    the ground.          This officer Packer, gave his radio to         Super­

intendent       Murrey a short time of going on to the pitch.                 This

Page 8B.

This     witness     said    that    he thought that gate      3   was    opened

between 3 o'clock and one minute passed three.



Cross     examined    by Mr.Woodwood at page 8E.         This witness       said

that     gate 3 was closed for a short time after a number of fans

spilled     out.     He thought but is not absolutely sure that             this

was     because    that     fans    who were at the    front   were      getting

trampled     on and pushed down and he thought they shut the               gate

for a short time and then reopened it to try and get these fans

out    because they were getting squashed.            The gate was shut for

only a matter of seconds and then opened again.

Morning Session.

Witness Police Constable Michael Buxton called.              Examined     by
Mr.Phillips at page 12.




Police     Constable    Michael Buxton was in the Land Rover         fitted

with     a public address system on the day of the match which was

his regular duty at Leppings Lane end.        This officer received a

message     by radio when he was at Herries Road South at 2.40 and

he     drove to Leppings Lane the message had been to assist          with
crowd control.



Page 15D.

This     officer    got in touch with match control and      asked    that

match     control    to delay the kick-off.   The time   was     probably
approaching 3 pm.



Page 15G.

The witness says that he received an acknowledgment from ground

control     and    was told by ground control that it was too        late.


Page 16F.

The     witness says that he did not know of any gates opening but

there    must     have been a gate opened because the    crowd    simply

disappeared.        After this, this witness went onto the pitch and

assisted    in     getting   people out of gate 3 and then     formed     a

tunnel    with other officers and passed bodies back through            the
                                    -16-


tunnel of police officers.



Page 2IB.

This    witness     Buxton gives evidence of having run to the       Land

Rover and getting a portable loud haler, he gave this to Super­

intendent Nesbitt.



Page 22B.

In     cross    examination by Mr.Glasgow the witness says    that    he

received       a message to attend the ground from Sergeant   Goddard

in   match control "18 63 (this officer's shoulder number) go to

Leppings Lane end.      Assist with crowd control".

Morning Session.

Witness Detective Sergeant Paul Morton called and examined                   by
Mr.Collins.




Page 26.

Detective        Sergeant Paul Morton was on uniform duty on the            day

in question and was on D division serial 14 doing duties at the

Midland        railway     station   meeting and escorting    fans    to    the

match.        At about 2.50 this officer was in a vehicle travelling

along        Leppings Lane to get the ground and there was a         massive

crowd        outside     Leppings Lane and he thought there    was     little

chance of them all getting into the ground by kick-off time.



This        officer went to the gymnasium.      From there he was told to

go     to     Leppings Lane end of the ground.      He puts the      time    at
3.05.



Page 27E.

The witness saw people actually on the surrounding track behind

the     goal and to the right and thought at that time that we had

got a serious crowd disorder situation.           Some sort of invasion.

However,        he immediately realised that he was looking into rows

of     dead     people, thirty or forty people in the first three            or

four     rows     immediately to the rear of the Leppings       Lane       goal

with bulging eyes, there was some vomit.
                                        -18-


Page 27G.

The     officer      was    referring to pen 3.   This witness      spoke    to

Mr.Greenwood.



The witness describes the area that the upright dead were in as

to     the   right looking in - to the right of gate of pen 3.               He

saw     Inspector      Greenwood use his radio.    This officer did         not
use his radio because of the noise.



Page 30B.

This     officer said that Mr.Greenwood told him he could not               get

through      on    the air.     This officer tried to use his radio         but

without success.           He tried to get through to control to ask for

ambulances etc, but could not get through.



Page 30C.

This     officer     thought that at page 30 he did not       get    through

because      there    was too much air traffic.     This officer ran         to

fetch     ambulances.        At page 31B this officer gave evidence that

he     got to ......       in that officers did not appreciate what was

happening     and     that     he told a P.C.Burkenshaw and    an    unknown

Inspector that there were thirty or forty dead down at that end

and to get as many men as he could around the other end.



Page 3ID.

The officer gives evidence of speaking to the ambulance man who

was    talking     on the radio to his control and the        officer       was

saying that he wanted oxygen.          This officer was responsible for
                                              -19-


    getting     the St.John's Ambulance to come down to the other                     end

    by breaking the hordings down at the ground.

    The     witness       says that the advertising hordings           were    totally

    obstructing        the     entrance.     Vehicular traffic could          not     get

    through.        There     was   no difficulty in breaking          the    hordings

    down.      Back at the Leppings Lane end at page 32B this                  officer

    reported       back      to Mr.Greenwood who had still not been able               to

,   get     through    on     the radio.     This at 11 or 12      minutes      passed
    three.

    This     officer      became aware of a public order          problem      largely

    because     the    Nottingham       Forest    fans did not     know      what     was

    happening         and was still thinking that it was a Liverpool fan's

    disruption.        Measures     were taken to form a police           cordon       to

    stop     any public order problems.           The officers saw fire service

    in attendance and oxygen being used.

    Cross     examined       by Mr.Heitner.      This witness gave two         reasons

    for     problems      with radio.      He thinks that the noise          from     the

    crowd    was       so loud that you could not actually hear the                 radio

    and     therewas      a situation where you       could      not   get    through

    because of other air traffic that was on the radio.

    Cross     examined          by Mr.Glasgow in relation to   the    advertising

    hordings.          Reference is made to South Yorkshire document 1

    photograph         13.       The entrance between the North stand and          the

    Kop     and    the       witness described the    advertising    boarding       as

    running       parallel        to the concrete.   The advertising was      on     a

    board that was attached to the ground - standing advertising as

\   distinct from nailed or screwed to the board.



    Page 35C.

    Mr.Glasgow         put      it to the witness that Mr.Carsley - the       chief

    steward       of     the     Kop was physically moving.    The    advertising

    boards out of the way when this officer came and helped and the

    officer       said       that several people were moving the      advertising

    boarding out of the way to let that ambulance through.



    Page 36B.

    Asked     by Mr.Glasgow to confirm that, and it was not a question

    the     ambulance          sitting there waiting for it to be moved.        The

    officer said that he thought that to be the case.                If there was

    delay it was merely a few seconds, that is all.



    Page 36.

    Cross     examined         by Mr.Woodwood there is reference to a      public

    service       vehicle       full of police officers travelling     from     the

    Midland       station and supporters along Leppings Lane knocking on
the    side of the bus shouting "tickets".         When they appreciated

who    was    in the bus, they went away.       There were two or        three

separate      incidents       of one of two individuals banging     on    the

windows on the side of the bus, wanting tickets.



Page 37.

This    officer being cross examined by Mr.Woodwood said that the

advertising         hording   was not a significant obstruction to        any
progress.

It    was    just    a question of breaking it down.     This     witness'
evidence is completed at page 38.

Witness Detective Sergeant David Gutcher called and examined by
Mr.Phillips.




Page 38.

Detective      Sergeant David Gutcher was on uniformed duty on                     the

day     in question which took him to the Midland station and that

he     came back with his serial by about 2.30 and from that                      time

was     available    in    the   police room on stand     by     duties.            He

received      an instruction from the Inspector at the police                     room

adjacent to the gymnasium to take up position inside the ground

at     the   turnstiles    at the Leppings Lane end.           They     went        to

turnstiles      numbered     1   to 16.    They entered   from        the        North
stand.



Page 38H.

This     witness    says in relation to a question relating                 to    the

efficient     operation     of the turnstiles "the supporters                coming

through those turnstiles seemed to be coming through very, very
slowly".

Friday 9th June 1989 Morning Session



Evidence       of Detective Sergeant Gutcher examined by Mr Phillips
at page 39.



Being     questioned        about     the slowness of the     turnstiles      this

witness        said page 39        (B) "at one point one of    the     turnstile

operators        handed     me a ticket.     He pointed out to me that         the

supporter        whose     ticket     that was had come through       the    wrong

turnstile,        in     effect.    His ticket was for the     west     terrace,

(apparently        this was an example of one of the reasons why               the

turnstiles        were slow.       There is other evidence elsewhere as to

the     reason     for     the turnstiles being slow.       Page     39(G)    this

witness        says that     he instructed the turnstile       operators      to

forget     about       checking tickets because of the severe           crowding

outside.         Page 39(H) the officer agreed that he instructed the

two     turnstile operators just to let everybody through                whether
they had tickets or not.



At    page41     this officer responds to a call to            go     onto    the

pitch.      He     followed officers who where running and they              went

via     the south stand.       At the time this officer arrived at            the

Leppings Lane end there             were officers already up on top of the

perimeter fencing pulling people over the top.                He went through

Gate 2 into Pen 2. His recollection was that the Gate was open.

There    was     plenty of space in Pen 2.        He went to the        nearest

perimeter        fencing near the railings with Pen 3 and assisted in
     pulling people over from Pen 3.



 At     Page 42 (H) this officer gives the opinion that the                    people

 who      were injured at the front of the Pen had been there since

 earlier        and they were innocent people who suffered because                     of
 the people who arrived later.



 At     Page 43 (E) this witness gives evidence of seeing the                    pile

 of     bodies       in Pen 3 and gave the position of those            bodies     as

 "ten     to     twelve feet back up the terracing from the              perimeter

 fence.        it seemed to be as far as he could see along the length

        the fence.           It was right as far as the corner against which

 he     was.    The witness did not at that time see whether any part

 of the crush barriers were missing.              This is at page 43 (H).



Page      46     (G )     This witness says that he saw part       of    a     crush

barrier        and knew it was part of a crush barrier because of its

colour         and      it    was thrown from a couple of feet      behind       him

over     the     perimeter fence at the police.         This was     while       the

rescue        effort was still going on.        There were other supporters

running        forward        from behind this officer trying to scale           the

fence,        using the pile of bodies as steps to get themselves                 up

onto     the fence and in my opinion that was totally               unnecessary

at     that time.         it was just hindering the effort to get             people
out.     This at page 46 (H)



At     page    48(F)         and (G) this witness is   challenged       in     cross

examination          by      Mr Hytner in relation to the officers           opinion
that     half   an   hour   before   kick off   for   a   match     of     this

importance      was a late-comer and the officer refused to comment

on     the   advice in relation to the encouragement of           people     to

come     only   fifteen minutes before; that is to get        into       their

seats fifteen minutes before. This at page 48 (G).

Friday 9th June 1989 Morning Session



Witness        Police        Constable      Michael          Vincent   Ryan    called        and

examined by Mr Collins at page 51



Police Constable Michael Vincent Ryan was on duty on the day in

question at Hillsborough in the Control Room and has been doing

those      duties          for the last five years.              He was     with     Sergeant

Goddard.        He tested the public address system at shortly                             after

8 O'clock in the morning when he came on duty.                             One speaker was

being     worked on by an engineer quite near ground control.                                 It

was     the     speaker affixed to the side of the west                       stand.         The

cameras        were switched on when he came on duty and there was                             an

apparent        fault on the camera to the west stand, west terraces.

He thinks it is the one mounted on the electronic scoreboard.



At     page 52 (H) the witness says that as far as he is aware all

the     cameras        in    that position are the              ground      cameras.         The

picture        was     very distorted.          The witness contacted               Mr     Roger

Holdsworth           who    attended      and worked on that              camara     but     the

picture according to this officer was never satisfactory as far

as     he could recall on that day.                  The picture was not as                clear

as he would have hoped.                The zoom was operative but the picture

quality was a problem.               This all on page 53.              The other cameras

were     all     working       all right.         The cameras on that              date    were

operated        by     Police Constable Bichard.                This officer's            duties
were     to     deal        with telephone conversations,                telephone        calls

coming        into        the ground and also the public address.                      This     at

page     53      (F).          There are three telephones,            one       which     gives

direct         contact         with     the club.      That one is       to     an     internal

system         all     the      internal telephone extensions.                  There     is     a

police         line       which       gives contact with        Police        Stations,       the

internal        Police          telephone system also giving them an                    outside

line     if     they require one and there is also a                       direct       outside

line.         The     internal          ground telephone relates to              a     list     of

extension            numbers           which    they    have     in   control.          Giving

extensions           of     people       within the Club and in            particular          the

ability to telephone the Club's control room where the Club has

its     own videos and more particularly the monitoring of                              people

coming     through             the     turnstiles.       Page     54 (C)       the     Witness

confirmed that the Police had Police Officer Constable Guest in

the     Club     Control             Room.     If required       to   check      on    numbers

entering        the ground this would be done either by telephone                              to

Club     Control          or    by the Club radio.             If this officer         was     to

check     he     would         use the telephone.         At page 55           this    witness

gives     evidence concerning Police radio operating on channel 24

and the talk—through facility (details are given in relation to

radios     on        page      55      and 56 but I will         not here       give     those
details)



At     Page 56 there are               also details of channel VHF 1 and channel

       a (C.I.D. channel               on VHF) and at page 57 details as to                   the

Club     radio        system.         The witness at page 57 (D) said                 that     he

was     aware        that over the Club radio he could ask for Mr                         Locke
o r Mr T h o r p e o r w h o e v e r .




At     page 59 at (C) this witness gives evidence that about                            2.30

there        was     a    fault     on     the radio.     A   civilian    from     Police

Communications Department, Mr Sanderson came into Ground Control

and at page 59 (D) this witness says that following the efforts

of the radio engineer "we then changed to talk-through facility

on     that radio using another radio that we had in there".                            From

that     time        only talk—through was used.              Which      meansthat only

one     person        can speak at any one time on the radio.                    If     more

people        try it clogs up the airway.                The airway channel        became

very     congested.           At     page 60 (H) this witness agreed             that     he

noted        that     the turnstile seemed to be operating                more     slowly

than     normal.          At page 61 this witness refers at 2.15 to                   being

requested           to speak to supporters in the Leppings Lane                   terrace

to     ask     them to move away from the entrances.                  At page 62         (B)

the      officer          recalls        he relayed a message to the        effect        "a

Police       Message        to Liverpool supporters on the             Leppings        Lane

Terraces.           Would     you        please move away      from theentrances.

Please       move        away from the entrances to           allow      people       infrom

behind".           This     message was sent by tannoy inside the                 Ground.

The     officer          sent this message once or twice.             At page 63         (B)

the      officer          gives     evidence    of   a    further     tannoy     message

announcing          "The Police Message to the Liverpool Supporters                      at

the     Leppings          Lane turnstile.       Would you please stop          pushing.

There     are       supporters being crushed at the              turnstile.           Would
you   please   stop pushing"   He passed this message five or   ten
times.



The Inquiry adjourned for lunch at page 63.

Friday 9th June 1989 (afternoon session)



The     Witness          M        V    Ryan recalled and examined             by    Mr    Collins
continued at page 64.



At     page 64 (F) this witness gives evidence of him being                                  asked

when     the        supporters were on the pitch to pass a                         message       to

them     to clear the pitch and to move onto the perimeter tracks.

He     passed that message several times during a period of a good

few     minutes.              The timing of that doing the best he could                         was

five          minutes             after        the   match    had      been        stopped        or

thereabouts.             Mr       Duckenfield he believed gave him that                    order.

The     witness          recalled            passing a message        when    officers          were

trying        to get into the back of the central tunnel and at                                 page

65     (B) he passed a message asking Liverpool supporters in                                    the

central       pens           to       move   back to allow officers to             get     in     to

assist injured people.



At     page        65    (H)          cross-examined by Mr        Glasgow      this      witness

confirms       that           there is reasonable contact between the                      Police

Control       Box        and the Club Control Box but at page 66 (B)                            this

witness       says           that he does not recall contacting the                      Club     in

respect       of the build up of the crowd figure on that particular

day.      In response to a difference of evidence identified by Mr

Glasgow       as        to     the contact with the club at              page       66(C)        the

witness       says           "the difficulty I am faced with there is that                         I
could        have     spoken    to a member of the   Club,    certainly,        and

passed        the message       on if he asked to speak to        someone      else

within        the Control       Box, in as much as I did      not      personally

take     a     message     regarding   the   build up   of    the      crowd    and

figures.         However, if somebody in the Club control rang me and

asked        to speak to another officer in the Police Control then I

would     have put them onto that officer and would obviously                  not

know     what the message was, but I personally did not check that

message".        The officer said that he was not saying that contact

was     not     made     just that he did not recall it       happening.        He

accepted        at     page 66 (E) that the Police would normally be            in
contact with the Club regarding this.



At     page 67 cross examined by Mr Glasgow about contact with the

Club     by     radio and/or telephone and the witness rather             having

fenced        on the point Mr Glasgow in response to question by               the

Judge     said that there were calls between the Club and                Control

by     radio    and phone up until about quarter to three.              This    at

page     67     (D).     At page 71(F) cross examined        by   Mr    Whitwood

further in           relation   to communications passing between         Police

Control       and Club Control the witness says "I cannot say that I

did    not     get     any calls from the Club but      I    cannot     honestly

recollect".          The evidence of this Witness was completed at page

Friday 9th June 1989 (Afternoon Session)



Witness        Police Sergeant Michael Goddard examined by Mr Philips
at page 71.



Sergeant           Goddard was in the Control Box on the day in question

and has experience of being on the Control since January 1986.



At     page        72 the officer is asked questions about             the        various

radio facilities and at page 74(A) the witness says that it was

his     intention          to   have radios on talk-through.          This        is     the

norm.         At     page 75 the officer gives evidence that                the        Chief

Superintendent             wanted     a log to be kept of the        Control        Room.

This     officer          started     keeping the log and then it           was        taken

over     the Superindendent Murray.                  At page 7 6 there is     evidence

as     by where various people sat in the Control Room. At page 77

this     officer gives evidence of his asking for Leppings Lane to

be     closed        to    traffic.     The timing is set to be at           2.17       but

this     officer          thought that it occured a bit later             than      that.

At     page 78 this officer gives evidence of the radio                     beginning

to     break       up     at about 2.2 5 to 2.30. this at page            78(D).         It

appears        that       the back-up set did not work for one            reason         or

another        and      at page 79(A) the officer gives evidence that                    he

went     on     to use the normal handheld Motorola radio                 which         was

again     on       talkthrough.         He switched it to       Channel     25.         The

officer        continues        at    page 7 9 to explain      the   difficulty          of
using the handset               because it could not belifted up, one had to

bend     down.        Theplug     lead to the base station                   is     not        long

enough        for it to have been placed on the desk.                       This was given

as     the     reason     for using the hand held radio.                     This        officer

gives        evidence     at page 80(E) concerning Mr                 Buxton's           request

for     kick off to be delayed and says that this request came                                  as

the     teams came onto the field to kick off for the start of the

match     proper.         At page 81 (B) the witness             gives his              evidence

that     he     replied         to PC Buxton "it is too late, one                       team    is

already        on the field".           The witness gave that response off his

bat.      He did not pass that message to Superintendent Murray or

Chief     Superintendent           Duckenfield         but said that          the       request

came     quite        clear on the radio and his assumption was that                            Mr

Murray or        Mr     Duckenfield       had heard it.          At     page        82(D)       in

response        to     a question by the Judge this witness                       effectively

said     that on the basis of his assumption that Mr Murray or                                  Mr

Duckinfield would have heard the request he considered that the

decision         not     to     delay    kick-off      was     made     by        the     Chief

Superintendent            although he did not ask him.                 At page           83    the

witness        gives      evidenceabout the order to open the gates                            and

at     page 84 (D)        there isevidence that whoever it was that said

"they        have      broken     through"      that    occurred        way       before        Mr

Duckenfield            decided     to    open   the     gates.        The     gates           were

apparently ordered to be opened by Mr Duckenfield on the                                  third

request        for them to be opened.           At page 85 the              Witness       gives

evidence       thathe      passed the message on channel                      25        for    the

gates     to    be     opened.          Although it was an        open        channel          the

message       was      directed to Mr Marshall.              The message          was     "open
the     gates .           At page 8 6 there is evidence of a message from                            a

Sergeant           Higgins in charge of serial 20 requesting that Gate A

be     opened           and     in view of what Mr Duckenfield has                  said       this

witness           responded           open    the gate".      The    witness's        previous

assumption              was     that "open the gates" referred to Gate                     C    for

some         reason.            Although he       did not     specify      Gate      C.        This

witness           tookit upon himself to instruct Sergeat                         Higgins        to

open         Gate A. At page 87 and 88 the witness having                         seen people

climbing           over        the    fence     and thinking he       had     got     a     pitch
invasion Mr Murray said "deploy".



At page 88 the witness sees Superintendent Greenwood signalling

for the match to be stopped.                      This witness did not get in touch

with     any of the emergency services.                     At page 8 9 PC Bichard got

in touch with Snigg Hill or Hamerton Road.



At     page        89     the witness received a request for                  bolt        cutters

which             might have          been at     3.10.     The     witness          requested

Claywheels               Lane        for   bolt    cutters,       there     was       nothing.

Claywheels              Lane    is their traffic division.                The Fire        Brigade

was     then           called at page 89.          This office made the call.                   The

call     was made to Force Control for the                        Fire Brigade.           At page

96(C)        in cross examination by Mr Muller this witness says that

there        is        a blind spot from the window of the Police Box                          down

3-t    the        front of the terrace.             But at page 9 6 (G)        the        witness

appears           to     say that the people at the front of pens 3 and                          4

could have been seen by zooming in on one of the cameras.
At page 105 cross               examined by Mr Glasgow the witness says that

he,     the        witness,       checked     the figures   for    spectators        with

P C Guest           on three or four occasions as the figures built                   up.

The witness did not have any difficulty in contacting Mr Guest.

He     contacted           Mr Guest by telephone.       Nobody told the        witness

that they were having difficulty in getting through to the Club

either        on     the      radio or through the telephone.          The     witness

thinks        the last time he spoke to P C Guest to get the                   figures

for     the        ground      attendance would be well after         two     O'clock.

The     witness          passed       the   figures round the     Control     Room     by

saying        there are so many in now.            On one or other occasion            Mr

Duckenfield             has said to the witness would you find out what is

in     here.        At page 106 the witness repeats that Mr Murray                    was

the     officer         who     was    actually taking the      decisions      in     the

Control        Box and that only one of the decisions that was                      taken

that     afternoon was actually taken by Mr Duckenfield.                      In     this

respect        it was put to the witness at page 106(F) that the                      one

decision           (which      Mr Duckenfield did take took so long for               him

to     announce         that     a number of people were either            asking     him

what     that decision was or as in the witness's case                     physically

turning        round        in order to see what his response was going                to

be.     The        witness replied "I am not saying it took him a                   long

time    to make the decision. No, he was asked a question and                         he

responded          to    it.      Mr Glasgow then at page         106(G)    took     the

witness        through         the request for the opening of the Gates              and

the    time it took for Mr Duckenfield to respond.                    This at       page
106 and over on page 107.
At    page     107(D) the      witness agreed that there    was      a     delay

between       14.47       and 14.52 before a positive order was given           in

response      to      a    request which had originally been    made       by     a

Superintendent            in difficulties at 14.47. At page 107 (G)         and

(H)   Mr Glasgow          asks the witness about the view of the front of

the   terraces         from the Control Room and the     possibilities          of

directing      a      television    camera onto the   section   or       sending

somebody      out     onto the step of the Control Room to        physically

look straight down as another alternative.            Nobody went outside

to    look.        Thewitness Goddard finishes at page 108           and     the

Inquiry adjourned until 10.30 a.m. on Monday at page 109

Witness:   Police Sergeant Michael Goddard recalled and                  cross-
examined by Mr.Woodward at page 1.




Mr.Woodwood       questioned    this witness further about radios             and

then    went    on   to question him further about the        h i .....        at

control in the control box.



Page 2D.

The    witness said       that using a   handset resulted in the       control

room being in the same position as any individual in the ground

and at page 3B the witness agreed that the use of the system of

last    resort,      the handset, gave a better option than the              full

system.        (It   is demonstrated that this is not the case               since

with    the     full capacity radio communications available in               the

ordinary way when there is no failure control can cut away from

speak     through and switch to officer and another which does not

have    the     problem     of others    butting in).   At page    3     D    the

high           within      the control   room is discussed and     set       out.

The order is Duckenfield, Murray, then the two P.C's.



Page 5 C & D.

Was     said to be M r .Duckenfield's decision, by that the time                he

responded      to the request for the kick-off to be postponed this

officer       said things had gone so far.      (Too far for the game to
                                -2-


be delayed).

There   is further discussion with regard to the radio and a non

talk through situation.



The witness Goddard's evidence is completed at page 7.

Peter       Wells     is divisional superintendent with                          the       St.John's

Ambulance           Brigade.           He     has     had     overall        control        of       the

organisation          of     St.John's            ambulance at football                  matches      at

Hillsborough          for     about four years.                 He was in control of                 the

ground       for     normal league matches, they normally have                               ten      or

twenty       St.John's ambulance personnel but for semi-finals                                     this

number       is increased (he does not at this stage say the                                     number
present).



Page 9B.

The    witness says that he does not have a direct line to county

ambulance        service, there are two ambulance officers there from

the    club      site with radios who can radio to vehicles.                                 He    can

get    through to vehicles through the club.                             Regarding         liaision

with     Sheffield         Wednesday club this witness said                         that      Graham

Mackrell       the     secretary is always available for discussion                                  if

anything       arises.        The club makes a donation to St.John's                              each

year.       As a voluntary organisation they decide for                                  themselves

who    to    send to a match and what they should do when they                                     get

there.       St.John's have six radios altogether.                             They have their

own wavelength.            The police cannot contact them by radio.
                                           -4 -


Page IOC.

The witness said we contact the police verbally.                       We do keep in

contact with the police.            Not on the radio.



Page 10.

It     becomes clear that they took 25 adults, 5 senior cadets and

3     junior      cadets   and   two     ambulances      to     this   match.     One

ambulance was outside the first aid room under the north stand,

the     other was in the car park at the junction of the south end

of     spion      Kop   entrance.      The first-aid room under          the    north

stand       was a room provided by the club.             This at page 10F.        The

contents of the room is provided by St.John's ambulance.                        There

were        two    examination      couches       in   there,     blankets,       and
stretchers.



Page 11C.

The witness says that oxygen is carried on both ambulances.


At 11G.

This    witness says that the oxygen sets can be used either with

a face mask or if the tube is placed in the mouth of the victim

it will blow oxygen straight into the lungs.



Apparently there has been some criticism about oxygen cylinders

and    at page 12D this witness gives evidence that the                    cylinder

he    was    operating was operating perfectly and is still                    locked

away now in case anybody wants it.
                                      -5-


At     page 16 this witness give evidence of assisting injured          by

passing       the tube of an oxygen .... in the cylinder through the
fence.



Page 17F.

The     witness gives evidence of a piece of concrete being thrown

at the fence and it shattering just by him.         Thrown by a fan.


Page 20.

Cross    examined by Mr.Muller this witness gives evidence of him

asking     for   bolt     cutters or something to get the     fence   down

within     minutes      of him being aware that there   was   casualties

behind     the fence.     The witness thinks he made his request      for

bolt cutters at between 10 and 12 minutes after 3 o'clock.



Cross    examined by Mr.Maxwell at page 22B there is reference to

the emergency kit which the witness Wells asked Graham Mackrell

(for    the    club) to provide which he did.    This   emergency     kit

contained      triangular bandages, emergency dressings and       things
of that nature.



Page 24.

The witness is cross examined by Mr.Glasgow.        The witness Wells

had dealt with Mr.Mackrell and Mr.Lock of the club.



Page 24G.

The    witness says that for the last two years he has been asked

to    go down to the pre season steward's meeting along with          the
                                          -6-


police        and     fire brigade just to have a chat to          the        stewards

about     what we (St.John's Ambulance) would expect them to do in

the case of an accident so we can liaise).



Page 25C.

In     response       to a question by the Judge the witness              said     the

sort     of        instruction or request that they give to stewards                is

"if they see a casualty or if someone suffers a heart attack or

something,          they inform the police who inform us and then                 they

guide     us straight through with a minimum of loss of time so we

know     exactly          where we are going to and what we - - -             further

advice        is    given     as to what stewards should not do           which     in

principal is, they should simply remain with the person and not

attempt        to do anything that they are not qualified to do until

a qualified first-aid arrives.             This at page 25F.



Page 26F.

Reference is made to the Sheffield Wednesday bundle at page 134

which     is       apparently    a letter from        the   St.John's     Ambulance

Brigade        assuring      the club secretary of first-aid cover              being
provided.



Page 27E.

There     is       reference    to 1982 when local authority            and    safety

committee          were    concerned   about    the    adequacy   of      first-aid

facilities at the ground and the witness said he was aware that

a    visit     was made to the first-aid room in the north stand                   in

order    to satisfy themselves that what was available there                      was
                                               -7-


satisfactory.



Page 28C.

There     is evidence from this witness that two years                     previously

this     witness        had requested Mr.Mackrell for the emergency                  bag

and Mr.Mackrell had said "well, let me know what you want and I

will     get it for you" and that was from the emergency point                        of
view, dressings etc.



Page 28G.

Mr.Glasgow           asked     the   witness     whether looking      back     on    the

tragedy        was     there      other equipment which from         the     St.John's

point     of     view       the   witness      would have    liked   to      have    had

provided.        The witness said "not really necessary, because I do

not think any amount of equipment or any amount of knowledge on

that     field       would have helped, I mean there has been a lot                   of

talk     about       defibrillators and resusitation equipment                but     it

would     not have helped those casualities in the ground".                         This

at     28G.      The witness then said at 28H that if the club                     would

like     to     provide defibrillators and things like this                  then    we

will     certainly          train our personnel to use them.             Page 29     the

witness        gives    further evidence concerning the danger                that     a

defibrillator          would      be in unskilled hands - you cannot use               a

defibrillator          on     someone   until        there heart   has     gone     into

defibrilation.          If you do, you are going to electricute them.


Page 29E.

There     is    an     apparent defirmative that            defibrillators        would
                                                -8-


have     helped        on    the      pitch as well as it could            well     be     the

witness     intention           to say that defibrillators would                  not     have

helped.          It      was       put    to   the    witness     that     the     use      of

defibrillators on that pitch in the circumstances which we have

seen     would        have     been completely out of            the     question.        The

witness     agreed and then said defibrillators would have helped.

This is the reason why there could be a ......                         omitted.



Page 3OB.

Again     in respect of equipment this witness says "on the                             point

about     equipment,           that      even with resusitation you              cannot    do

better     than mouth-to-mouth, which was being done".                        At 30C the

witness     gives        an opinion that a team of surgeons there                       would

not have saved any more lives than were saved.



Page 37H.

There     is reference to the safety certificate and the ratio                             of

first-aiders          and      numbers of the crowd.            The witness       was     not

aware     of the particular number or the ratio and since this was

during     re-examination             by Mr.Collins, Mr.Collins referred                  for

the record to paragraph 8(3) of the Safety Certificate.



Page 38D.

The     witness was asked by the Judge of anything else he thought

might     be provided in the first-aid room, the witness said                             "on

reflection       I think with liaison with the club we could provide

a far better service, by either equipment or communication".
Page   30 throughout, there is discussion of what might possibly

be provided for the future.

Witness:   Police Constable Trevor Bichard called and              examined
by Mr.Collins at page 39.




Police Constable Trevor Bichard was on duty in the control room

on     the day in question.       The witness has worked in the control

room     at football matches since September 1987.         On the day his

specific       duty    was in relation to the videos, and that is       his
normal job.



The     witness admitted that in his statement he had been out           on
his timings on several occasions.



Page 41 and 42.

There     is   discussion concerning the placement of the          cameras.

There     is   further     discussion as to the    capabilities    of   the
cameras and what can be seen.



Page 49f.

The    possible       reason   for gate c being   opened   first   becomes

apparent.       The    witness Bichard was looking at gate c       on   the

monitor     and drew M r .Duckenfield's attention to gate c when the

request came through for the gates to be opened.


Page 51.

The    witness being asked about the effect of gate c opening           on
                                              -li­


the centre tunnel.                 He witness said that the simple fact of the

matter     is     that the tunnel is not in view from the camera                and
therefore is out of mind.



Page 52H.

Concerning        the attitude of the police control room the witness

thought        that it was a pitch invasion and he said that this was

not realised quickly but it was otherwise and said "I would not

say     fairly        quickly.       For a period of time we were looking        at

that     situation           and    I would speak for other officers      in    the

control        room     as     a pitch invasion.     This    attitude   continued

certainly for three or four minutes".



Page 54.

It    was this witness who made the request for the ambulance and
also for the fire brigade.



Page 56C.

The     witness says that he has never been briefed in relation to
monitoring the crowding.



Page 57D.

There     is    reference           to liaison   between    Sheffield   Wednesday

controlling       police control and at E the witness says the                 club

system     is    not connected to ours, we cannot see what they                are

seeing.     However, they have access to ours.



Page 60E.
                                   -12-


This     witness   considered a pitch invasion to be when the   fans

get     onto the perimeter track whether they go on to the playing
area or not.



Page 61C and D.

This     witness confirmed that in cross examination by Mr.Heitner

that     the   whole of the briefing and the whole of his   training

turned     his mind solely to the problem of public order and this

officer's      mind and the mind of other officers of his rank, had

never    been a ..... by training or briefing to the   possibility

that there might be overcrowding and crushing on the terraces.

         during the course of the examination by this witness the
enquiry adjourned for lunch.

 Witness:          P.C.Bichard        cross    examined      by      Mr.Gibson-Watt

During      the    course       of this witness being        cross    examined       by

M r .Callipetis       at       69D the witness speaks of one tape            expiring

just after 3.00.              Immediately thereafter there is discussed the

possibility of this witness having caught his knee on the video
controls.



Page 70.

There     is    further        evidence concerning the        operation       of    the
tapes.



Page 80G.

During     cross      examination      by Mr.Glasgow the          witness     Bichard

confirmed       that he had no reason to doubt that Sergeant Goddard

is     accurate     when       he says that he had contact with             the    club

during the course of the afternoon.                   The witness however had no

recollection        of any conversation.             The evidence of the witness
Bichard is completed at page 85.



(It    should      be appreciated that the evidence of               this    witness

goes    into      a lot of detail about what occurred in               the    police
control   room   in   respect   of many   matters   which   have   been

    previously        covered by other witnesses.      The main force of this

    witnesses        evidence is his unbiased attitude as to what was             in

    his     mind     whether it helped the police case or not as          opposed

    possibly to the evidence of more senior officers.              For its full

    value     I can only suggest that the evidence of this witness                be
    read in full).



    Page 86F.

    The     witness       give   evidences of attending to a     fan    from     the

)   terraces        at about 2.40 who had a piece of grit in his eye             and

    had      been brought downfrom the west stand by a steward.                 This

    witness       at page 87 E walked across to gate 4 of the           perimeter

    track     and     saw and lot of people pressed up against the             fence

    basically        shouting    to get them out.    When this    happened       the

    teams were on the pitch kicking about.           A police officer opened

    the    gate     and     several people came out from the pen        and     this

    witness       started giving first-aid straightaway.         Quite a few of

    them      were     breathless and one he thought, had a broken         ankle.

    Thewitness       thinks that they       were guided towards    the        corner

    flag      by     police.     The witness thinks that the gate was         closed

    fairly quickly afterwards but did not see it close.                There were

    about two dozen people on the perimeter track.             The evidence of

Witness:         Frank        Godley called and examined by Mr.Phillips                  at
page 90.




Frank        Godley has been a member of St.John's Ambulance                        Brigade

for      about        five        years    and   normally     drives    one    of    their

ambulances.           On the day in question he had his ambulance parked

by underneath the north stand and his position on the pitch was

the corner of the spion kop and north stand.



Page 91.

This witness gives evidence of being concerned with two injured

people        whose injuries appeared to have nothing to do with                       the

later        tragedy when at page 91H the witness gives evidence of a

police        officer asking him to get his ambulance onto the pitch.

He     does     not     know what rank the police officer               was    but     the

officer        walked        in    front    of   him all the      way   and    led     his

ambulance        onto the pitch at the junction of the spion kop                       and

north stand and went down the track.                      All the way round, to the

back     of     the goal.          Having arrived at that point          the    witness

says     that at page 92F that there were police at the bottom                          of

the     ramp    and     just stood there.               They did not know     what     was

happening.       They looked as though they were waiting for orders.



Page 93A.

This     witness then gives evidence that when he got to the pitch

he     was    asked for oxygen.             Somebody said a doctor required             it
                                              -16-


but     while he was getting the oxygen bottle somebody else                     came

to him who could not breath so he used the oxygen bottle on him
first.



Page 93.

This     officer       then      becomes     involved with   the    treatment      of

injured        persons     and     subsequently      made three    trips    to    the

hospital        that     afternoon.        There were no radios    on      St.John's
ambulances.        This at page 94.



Page 95A.

Cross     examined by Mr.Glasgow, the witness is asked whether                     he

was     held up momentarily by something that was going on on                     the

pitch but the witness said that he was able to come straight on

to     the pitch.      The only hold up was at the bottom of the                 ramp

with     the    police congregating at the bottom and as soon as                   he

got     through     that he went straight up.           He just    followed      the

officer straight up to the back of the building.                   This witness'

evidence is completed at page 95.

his     radio     which said there was some discussion                         taking       place

regarding       delaying the start of the match.                     This witness            then

turned     round       to the Liverpool supporters and told                          them    they

were going to have to wait a bit longer to see the match.

there     had been a big         push and all the people were screaming at

the     front    of     the     fence     so we were likely               to     get    a    few

and     making their way up to the corner where this witness                was.

A police officer asked this bunch of fans to go into pen               1.     At

this     time      the witness became aware that something     was      wrong

behind       at the back of the goal area, this was shortly after              3

o'clock.        In pen 3 he saw people being crushed.

Police       Constable Harold Guest was working in the club                     control

room on the day of the match.                    There was video monitors in this

room.       There were also computer screens.



The     witness         said      there are twenty monitors which         work        from

cameras        situated strategically placed around the ground                       which

cover      all 95 turnstiles.                There is a monitor in the centre           of

the control room in there which is coupled to the cameras which

is     situated         in the main police control.           On the side of          this

monitor        is     a switch.           Bearing in mind that this     witness        has

only     got one screen and the police have four cameras.                       He     can

then     put then either from 1 to 4 and switch to any of the four

cameras       that are being used in the police control room.                        It is

this officers choice which camera he receives the signal from.



There      are      employers            of the club in the   club    control     room.

Roger Holdsworth is in there and he is the person who installed

the system on behalf of the club, another person is Mr.Lock who

is    the main security officer on behalf of the club.                    The three
                                      -2-


of      them Holdsworth, Lock and Guest spent the afternoon in         the
control room.



The     computer screens in there give information that is         .....

up     as regards starting right from the beginning of the        match.

Once the turnstile operators are briefed and leave to go to the

turnstiles,        the first person to arrive at the ground will show

up on the computer screen.         It does not matter which department

or     which turnstile he has entered, as soon as that happens all

the other 20 monitors are recorded.           By this he meant there are

20 videos which monitor those 20 cameras.           He can see the first

person     to     come into the ground.     The officer is only able    to

see     people     coming through the turnstiles and has a choice       of

looking     at the video relayed from the police control room from
his choice.



Page 104.

This     officer     says   that on the table in front of him    in    the

video     room there is a list of each section of the ground as to

what     capacities are and for each area with the grand total         at

the     bottom.     This witness is subject to Superintendent     Murrey
who is in charge of control.



Page 105B.

The     witness     says that there are two systems for    his   contact

with     the main police control box one is by the police personal

radio     and     second one being by the internal telephone     system.

This witness' radio is set to channel 25.           He has got a direct
                                               -3 -


telephone        link with the control box.              This officer is expected

to     inform     the police control box if any problems emerge                    from

his     sight     of the cameras.            There were three or four        requests

made from police control to him asking for specific numbers for

specific        areas     of        the   ground.     These   requests     came    from

Sergeant       Goddard         or     PC Ryon, mainly from      Sergeant    Goddard.

More often than not, it was by telephone.


Page 106.

This    witness         said at about 2.15 commented to Mr.Lock that                 we

were    only     approximately half full somewhere in the region                     of

£25,000     to       £30,000 had actually attended the ground               at     that

time.     That was for the whole ground.                The witness says that at

1.06    G that looking at the computer the numbers appeared to be
evenly split throughout the ground.


Page 107.

This    officer       gives         further evidence concerning      the     numbers

arriving       and    the video screens that he looked at and                at     the

same    page     he     gave evidence concerning the            activity     of     the

computer     when       the ground gets within 15% full it flicks                  from
blue on white to white on blue.



Page 107H.

The    officer       gives      evidence      that if anyone     jumps     over     the

turnstile       there     is another radar infa red over the top                  being

which records the red cursor on the computer screen to register

and a buzzer to sound for just two or three seconds.

Page 110.

This     officer did mention to control (club control) that                 there

was     the odd jumper in Leppings Lane but did not report this to

police     control.       He said at page 110 that this was because             it

was a matter for the club to sort out not the police.



The     officer      at page 11IF says that at 2.40 the        computer        was

pulsating      in     respect of Leppings Lane West stand showing              the
capacity.



Page 112D.

The     witness      says that the computers were not flashing at              all

for     Leppings     Lane terraces.      At 2.45.    The witness says         that

page     112H that he did not tell police control box because they

can     only   see    the same monitor as this witness can            see     from
their control box.



Page 113A.

The     witness says that he telephoned police control as we                  were

not     up to capacity at that stage.           This in the region of 2.40.

We    were approximately 3,000 short of capacity in Leppings Lane

terraces along not including the West stand.              At page 113G this

witness     was     aware    of   a build up in     the   entrances     but     he

contacted      police control because he said at that stage when he

first     heard       a     commentary   on     a   personal    radio         from

Superintendent        Marshall and he could see obviously things were

getting    out      of hand at Leppings Lane.       He did try at 113H         to
                                          -5 -


contact       main control room by radio and telephone but the                     line
was blocked - engaged.



Page 114B.

The     witness        says that as things appear to be getting              out     of

hand     Mr.Lock        also left the control room            to go to see         tohis

stewards.               This   at about 2.40 to 2.45. The witness was               not

able     to     keep     in touch with Mr.Lock.         Had    this    witness     got

through       to    police     control   he      was   going    to    reinforce     or

duplicate        what Mr.Marshall had already said by saying that                   he

required           further     assistance at Leppings Lane and for                 themto

organise         some    further police officers to go to Leppings                 Lane

area.     He will also have told them about the numbers he had got

on    his computer screen.          After 2 3 nobody asked for any numbers

and     he was unable to get through.              This officers       instructions

at    page 116C are that he must stay in the club control room at

aH      times      and must not leave i t .       He said there was a lot           of

valuable        equipment in the room.        The equipment belongs to             the
club.



At page 116D.

The witness says that Mr.Holdsworth saw the situation as it was

developing at Leppings Lane and he also went out of the control

room.      The witness did not know where he went.                    This   witness
was then along in the room.



Page 120 E and F.

The     witness cross examined by Mr.Heitner when speaking of                      the
                                             -6 -


Kop end, said that he only knew that the capacity                 for that area

of     the        ground is 21,000.       How many tickets were   sold    by    the

club,     whether          it was less than 21,000 or more, he         could    not

say.         He     is not told.       He said that he could only assume that

the     club         know the ground regulations and in respect           of each

area     andhow many people are allowed in any specific area                    and

they only           sell that amount of tickets for that particulararea.


Page 135.

Being cross examined by Mr.Maxwell, the witness Guest says that

at     1.35       H it looks as though a 1,000 went through that          should

not have          gone.     I believe this refers to the West        stand.


Page 136G.

Cross     examined          by    Mr.Glasgow the witness   referring     to     the

turnstile          infra red eyes, the witness says he did not know              as

Mr.Glasgow          suggested that some of the infra counters had              been
spoilt.



Page 137A.

Mr.Glasgow          suggests that at least one of them had had the wire

to it cut but the witness was not aware of this.



Page 135E.

The     witness          said he did not know that two of      the    turnstiles

which     are listed under West stand were in fact being used                  for

the     North       stand.       He did now that some of the   turnstiles       at

Leppings          Lane    end    had been closed, but he did not       know    how
                                          -7 -


many.



Page 138G.

The     witness explained that it was only in the previous                couple

of     days     prior       to his giving evidence that   he    had     actually

written        the     maximum    capacities down and only     then     that    he

realised        that       the West stand was showing more in     the     ground
that it is capable of accepting.



Page 139C.

Question that as to whether when Mr.Lock left the control room,

it     could       be said that he was leaving his post.        The     witness

said     "that is not his role".          If there was a problem involving

any    of the stewards out on the ground at the turnstiles or                   in

respect       of     car     parking area or things of this    nature,       then

sometimes       Mr.Lock       will go out of the control room to        go     and
sort the situation out.



Page 140.

There is discussion as to when Mr.Lock was actually in the club

control       room     and    whether he was there when the     gate     C     was

opened or not, but the witness has really no recollection.                     The

enquiry       adjourned during the course of this witness'             evidence
to the following morning.

Witness:   Police Constable Harold Guest recalled                    and     cross-
examined by Mr.Glasgow at page 1.




Mr.Glasgow           put one further question to the witness          concerning

whether        Mr.Holdsworth was in the room right up until 3 o'clock

and     the     witness said that that could be correct.             At     page    2

cross     examined by Mr.Woodwood Counsel delves into the position

of Mr.Lock and suggests that Mr.Lock is the person who could be

expected        to     have     everything   at his    fingertips    as     it    was

developing.            The witness said not all the time, but             obviously

when he is in the control room, yes.



Page 3.

There     is        reference    to   another club    member              who    was

apparently          going round the ground looking at the situation                in

respect        of     some of the turnstiles.        The witness    agreed       that

possibly        a    Mr.Darling might have come into the           control       room
from time to time.



Page 3G.

With    reference        to     the witness' view that      the    position      was

getting       out     of hand as he had previously expressed, there                is

reference       to     Mr.Lock's position and his responsibility             being

one    that     the witness would have expected him to endeavour                   to

deal    with        the situation getting out of hand and           the    witness
                                        -9 -


    agreed      and   Mr.Lock in fact went from the room saying that   he

    could see what he could do, and the witness agreed.



    Page 4G.

    The witness agreed under cross examination that when he was not

    able   to    use a communication to get through the control   room,

    his line of communication was to and through Mr.Lock.



    The witness Guest's evidence is completed at page 8.

Witness:        Ian Turner called and examined by Mr.Goldsack at page
8.




Inspector        Ian Turner was in charge of serials out in            Leppings

Lane     protecting the side roads of Leppings Lane barrier.                   The

witness said he had not the previous year had portable barriers
across Leppings Lane at any stage.



Page 8.

In     cross    examination      by   Mr.Glasgow the     witness     was     asked

whether        he knew Mr.Kenneth Evans assistant chief constable               of

West     Midlands     who is now the liaison officer to the            Football

Association        and the witness said he did not.         Later at page 9D

the     witness     said it was correct that if Mr.Evans .....                that

there     was     a system of filtering people and         checking    tickets

before     they     got   to     the turnstiles and that     there         was six

mounted     officers      forming specific queues, and that he saw and

was     impressed    upon by that organisation in 1988, the            witness

could     neither agree nor disagree.            The witness said that.        It

appears    rather vaguely at page 9 F that this witness               Turner's

evidence        ceases    and     then   there    is   discussionbetween

Mr.Goldsack       and the Judge confirming two witnesses who are not

able    to be present to give their evidence, Inspector Grace who

deals    with     last    year     and was position at     the   junction      of

Leppings       Lane and Penistone Road North and merely says that so
                                   -11-


far     as   he was concerned he had not caused any barriers to   be

put up at that stage with a view to filtering supporters coming

down    Leppings Lane and the second statement a police constable

Lang,    the officer who refers to the tunnel being closed at the

last    years   match and the reading of part of   that   statement.
The Judge agreed to this.

Intended Witness:    Police Constable Lang was not present and
the statement which had been made by him or part of it was read
by Mr.Goldsack.




This witness was positioned generally at the foot of the stairs
up to the West stand.



A.11    his evidence relates to the tunnel leading to the               central

pen     being     closed off, between 2.45 and 2.50 and          the    officer

directed         as     to   the   wing    entrances.   Then,   this   witness

apparently        called      further     officers to his location     and    the

gates     were        opened again after the additional police         took    up

duty in the tunnel and presumably redirected people.


Page 11.

The     enquiry       stops dealing with the evidence of P.C. Lang            and

there     is reference to a statement by P.C.Houson in            connection

with     the opening of gate 4 not being formally accepted and                it

being     disregarded        since it was challenged by other        evidence.

There     is on page 11 an objection to this by Mr.Heitner and                it

was     left    that the position in respect of the missing            witness

Houson would be left for the time being.

Witness:   Chief Inspector             McRobbie called      and     examined       by
Mr.Phillips at page 12.




Chief Inspector McRobbie was at the match in question wearing a

blazer     and    light    coloured         flannel trousers. He         was there

really     to observe how things were conducted.             He had       recently

been     posted    to F Division as Chief Inspector.              This    witness

attended     many parts of the ground and was at some time in                    the

control room itself.        The police control room.


Page 13D.

The     witness said that at a time close to 3 o'clock looking out

of     the window of the control box facing D he saw people coming

out onto the perimeter track           and moving towards thecontrol box

where     there is a pen or area        under the controlbox where there

was     plenty of space.      He saw    a police woman on the           gates
                                                                    .




where     there    was access into the space.          His appreciation          was

that this police lady had not opened the gate or since that she

should    open     the gate to really alleviate the pressure               within

the     central pens and to distribute the fans into an area where

there was space for them to be accommodated.



The     witness     decided     to     go     down   and   assist       just      as

M r .Duckenfield    said    "go and assist that police lady and                 open

that    gate and assist the facts who are on the perimeter                  track
                                              -14-


into     an     area    where there       is space".    And that      is    what    the

witness       did.      This at page13H.        The witness at 14D says            that

he     told the police officer when he arrived 'open that gate and

let    the      fans in, I am a police officer' but accepted that                    in

view    of his dress, the effect of it might have been losted                        on

her.      But        in any event, she did in fact open the             gate.      The

witness         is     questions         in   depth   about   the      actions      of

M r .Duckenfield        and     the   decision to open the          gates   and    the

witness       defends     the     time    that Duckenfield took to          make his

Witness:      Kenneth Rooke called and examined by Mr.Goldsack       at
page 32.




Mr.Rooke     was   stationed in the f.... operations room at      head­

quarters     (he is apparently a police officer although his      rank

is     not referred to) where just after 3 o'clock he was told      to

make     contact   with   the ambulance service control   room.    The

request was made by Chief Inspector Edmondson.        The pushing and

shoving     that this witness apparently recorded in a     transcript

of     conversation that he had made with the ambulance service he

gleaned     from general public conversation within the operations
room.



Page 34C.

The witness says that he heard within the room that there was a

possibility    that   a   gate had collapsed.   The   witness   Rooks'
evidence finishes at page 38.

Witness:    Susan   Elizabeth            Davies    called   -    examined         by
Mr.Phillips at page 38.




Susan Elizabeth Davies is a fire control operative at the South

Yorkshire       fire    service,       her duty is in the control        room     in

Wellington       Street,     the      headquarters in the centre        of    town.

This witness' duty is to listen to communications from both the

police and other services             and from thepublic and torespond to

those     communications       by      sending outinstructions          for     fire

engines     to attend.       Just after 3 o'clock she was talking              with

the    police    force control at Snigg Hill about          another          matter

entirely      when     the   message was interrupted at         15.13    and      45

seconds     with a request "can we have cutting equipment, please,

to    Hillsborough       straightaway".        At that stage there       was     no

indication of what part of Hillsborough it was meant.                   When she

requested     the address the request came "cutting equipment                   for

Hillsborough      Football     Ground straightaway" and         this     witness

asked what road Hillsborough road ground was on because she did

not   know specifically.           And she needs an accurate address            for

the   purpose     of access to the computer to get the            information

she needed.      To access the computer it is not sufficient to put

Hillsborough      Football     Ground, the computer needs the name               of

the   road.      Actually, what the computer wanted was            Pennistone
Road, Owlerton.

 The      witness          continues    to    give     her   evidence       as     to        the

 difficulties          she     is    under    in meeting     the     demands          of     her

 computer       notwithstanding that the message she receives in                             the

previous        period was "there has been a major accident, all                             the

ambulances           are     up there".      She still has to pursue             an     exact
address.



Page 42.

This     witness had no knowledge that there was a football                             match

at     all     on     that     day    and she asked whether         it   was       a        road

accident.            When she asked the caller what exactly it was,                         and

was     told that they wanted gutting gear, but this witness still

needed        the     exact     nature of the incident and at            page          43     in

response        to all the questions this witness was asking                       whomso­

ever     it was, that was trying to get cutting gear, she received

a     reply     "there        has    been a major      accident     at   Hillsborough

Football Ground where the semi-final is, the crowds have forced

their     way in, they have broken fences and gates down, I do not

know exactly what it is but there are people trapped".                             At this

she     says,        leave it to us.         A message took a minute and                three

quarters        to    receive.         And she instructed to         immobilise             six

water ladders, an emergency tender and a control unit which she
did.



Page 44.

The    first        unit at the ground was logged in at               15.22.            Seven

minutes       from the termination of the conversation that she                             had

with    the     police.         Once the information is            logged        into       the
                                  -1 8 -


computer,    all the witness had to do was to press a button       and

the   appropriate   stations   were   notified   on   their   computer

terminals.    The witness Davies' evidence is completed on       page

Witness:   Chief Fire Officer J.Swain called and                 examined      by
Mr.Goldsack at page 46.




Mr.Swain           is   station   officer at Rivelin Valley in      charge     of

Rivelin        1 appliance.       He was called to attend at     Hillsborough

at     16.03       at the Leppings Lane end of the ground because            they

had     been       watchin television at 3.05 and the driver         suggested

the     Leppings         Lane end.   He was able to get to    the    perimeter

gates.         The equipment they had was portable and they could not

get     further         because of an ambulance parked inside the         gates.

Cutting equipment was organised on the way to the job.



The     firemen         applied   a resusitator to a police    inspector      or

police        officer     and this witness said to a    police      inspector,

 where        do    you want me to go and what do you want me        to    do '?

The     police inspector said he did not know and tried getting on

the radio.          There was no response at all.    Getting nothing from

the police inspector he sent a fireman, Fireman                      down the

path     by the side of the river with instructions to find a more

senior        police officer and only finding a sergeant and          getting

no     help     from     the police inspector, the witness then       sent     a

leading        fireman down onto the pitch to see what was          happening

expecting the leading fireman to come back to report to him but

he    never came back and then the police inspector said to                this

witness 'to be honest, kid, I do not really think we need you'.

Witness:         J.Swain continued examination by Mr.Goldsack.




This witness was then approached by a Police Office who said we

need      all    the     resusitation equipment we can   get,   there     are

hundreds of dead and dying people on the pitch and this witness

went      back    to the machine and requested further appliances          to

attend with resusitation equipment.           At which stage Mr.Robjohns

of     senior     rank    to   this witness who   effectively   took     over

control     of     the incident.    Ten pumps were requested to        attend

and Robjohns said 'you stay here and I'll go to the pitch'.


Page 53E.

It   is    established that neither this witness nor his men            ever
used any of their cutting equipment.

 Station       Officer   Fletcher arrived at the scene at   22   minutes

past     and    went to Penistone Road end.    The witness stopped      at

the     double gate and asked the police officer what the incident

was.     It was a constable.      The constable did not know anything.

He     said perhaps enquire, so I asked at the gates.       The witness

asked     the constable at the gates who opened the gate and          they

drove     in.    Neither constable knew about the incident.      This is

at     15.22    approximately.    Inside another police constable     did

not     know    why they were there but said perhaps it was      at   the

other end of the ground.         The witness rang down.


Page 58.

A martial told the witness how to get in across the back of the

south     stand.    His crews had equipment with them but at no time

did     this fireman discover who was in charge of the incident on
the pitch, mainly firemen gave first aid.


Page 65.

In    answer to a question by the Judge the witness said that          if

he had been asked to get cutting equipment there, he could have

cut    through the kind of wire mesh that he saw about one minute

per    panel.     The witness said that if he had cut the .....        he

would have been in danger of having the whole lot coming on top
of the operator.
P a g e 66E.

The    Judge      establishes that bolt cutters do not    require    very

skilled        operation   and if bolt cutters were available   on   the

ground      it ought to be possible to get them to the scene and at

any   rate clear a gap in the fencing within a couple of minutes

and   the      witness agreed.   The witness Fletcher's   evidence     is
completed at page 66.

 Witness:               A.D.Hornsby     called and examined by   Mr.Goldsack         at
 page 66.




 It     is        not     clearly established by the     transcripts         just   who

Mr.Hornsby               is,    but from the jest of the evidence       it    appears

that         he     is probably the senior fire officer of some rank                who

was     off         duty but got a call at home.        He made his way to          the

ground immediately to the Penistone Road.                  This witness       ensured

that     all        rescues had been carried out and established              liaison

between           the police and ambulance and at an early stage went to

the gymnasium and got a briefing from Lockwood.                   The officer in

charge        from        the    Fire Service at the gymnasium.     In       fact    he

contacted           Mr.Robjohns there.         This witness went to the        police

control            box     and    saw   and   superintendent   there.        Probably

Mr.Murrey.               This occurred at about 4.15.      His intention was to

enquire           as to what further assistance they might give.               In the

police control room this witness was told at page 69A that they

were a little unsure as to what happened.                  They said that three

barriers had collapsed, that was all they knew.                   That was about
4.05.



Page 70.

There was discussion at page 70 on .... oxygen masks.


Page 71.
Cross examined by Mr.Woodwood this witness says that his belief

is     that    it would be of value to have a fire            brigade    liaison

°fficer       present at an event such as this.         If there had been a

fire     service liaison officer in the control box, this                officer

would      have        insisted   on   the   fire   service    being      called

immediately       and     they thought that people were trapped and              he

could     have    given    the details of the equipment         and     probably

exactly       where     he wanted the fire service to respond           to.      It

would     have    avoided the computer problem and would              avoid     the

frustration       of    people who were not fire service people               being
involved.



The evidence of the witness Hornsby was completed at page 77.

            Leadin9 Fireman                Housley        called    and    examined       by
 Mr.Phillips at page 77.




Leading      Fireman Housley is attached to central fire station in

Sheffield       and     responded     to    the call at the           same time          the

station     officer       Fletcher.         He was the officer in              charge     of

emergency tender.           It is a larger vehicle than an ordinary fire

engine.        it arrived at 22 minutes past three.                   Penistone         Road

entrance,       the     river     side.      In response       to     this officer's

question, a police constable told him that all he knew was that

it was crowd trouble at the Leppings Lane end of the crowd.                               He

was    under      the impression that there had been a collapse of                         a

fan due to the message he had received and that there was crowd

trouble.       It was not possible to get the vehicle down the south

side   where      the     road is e f f e c t i v e l y        over       to    form    the

entrance     to     the    club house itself.             This officer         radiod    to

station    officer        Fletcher        informing       him that    he       could    not

proceed    along that avenue and managed to get his vehicle                            back

onto Penistone Road.            Searching around, this driver went around

Leppings     Lane       roundabout and then along             Leppings         Lane     and

eventually saw Mr.Robjohn's car directly outsidethe gates.                               He

eventually      made his way onto the pitch at about 3.30                       and gave

assistance      with      their    equipment on the pitch.                The    witness

Housley's evidence is completed at page 81.

 Witness George Lloyd called and examined by Mr.Goldsack at page




 Mr .Goldsack         came   from   Liverpool    is a   long   time    Liverpool

 supporter       and    together    with   his brother    Raymond      had    been

 stewards at Anfield for possibly ten years.              This witness gives

 evidence about the 1988 semi-final and his stewarding there.


 Page 87E.

A little light comes into this witness' evidence and it appears

that     he     with his brother, was a Liverpool steward as was              his

brother,        and at 6 minutes past three, as he saw Liverpool fans

going     over the fence, he thought 'Hooligans again' and               wanted

to     get onto the pitch as soon as possible as they might listen
to a couple of scouse voices.



Page 88G.

In     cross     examination by Mr.Jackson, it is put to the            witness

that     he     was    at no time asked by Liverpool Football          Club    to

assist        Sheffield      Wednesday in stewarding of their ground          for

the    semi-final         and   the witness said that his      chief    steward

_______________ asked him to go in that capacity.              There is also

doubts about the tickets and the private arrangements that this
witness made to get into the ground.
Page 90.

Cross     examined        by Mr.Glasgow, Mr.Glasgow took the     view     that

whether     he     was official or unofficial he thanked him for           the

efforts     he had made and the fact that this witness represented

a responsible supporter and Mr.Glasgow accepted this witnesses'

advice     that it was a good thing for away teams to bring             their

own    stewards         with them, because it helped.    (The evidence     of

this    witness is totally unintelligable but it appears that              he

attends     away        matches as a steward and is accommodated by       the

club      that     he     is   visiting).   This   witnesses   evidence    is

Raymond        Lloyd is a stewart at Liverpool and the brother of the

 last      witness and attended this year and the previous year                    and

at      page    102D it appears that this witness saw               chief     steward

_____________          and       appears that he might have been invited to
stewart        at     the    match but it is not clear.        (I    do     not   know

whether the evidence of this witness will ever be important but

in    my    view      only, if it is ever considered to             be    important,

should it be analysed to find out what it is all about).

Never      having been clear whether this witness was a steward, an

invited steward, self entitled steward or whatever.

Cross      examination        by   Mr.Glasgow,    the   witness      agreed       that

 whatever the books may show, the true position is that when he

was     offered       payment,     he and his brother both said           that     any

payment        that    to    which they would have      been    entitled,         they
wanted to go into the disaster fund.

 Brian     Sales    acts   as a turnstile operator both     at    Sheffield

he     received     a briefing but it is not clear who gave him         that

This     witness    was    told by a ranking police     officer   who      let

end.     This instruction applied up until about 2 o'clock.

     people        to    a police constable who turfed them out.              There       was

     then     the enormous crush outside the turnstiles and people were

     just     cocking their leg over the turnstiles and getting in                        and

     there    was        nothing that could be done about it.               The    witness

    through        without       tickets.      Later on just before         the        match,

    the     fans did not care whether they got their ..... back or not

    and it was just a matter of collecting tickets really.                         When he
