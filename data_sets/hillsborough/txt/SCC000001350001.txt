HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
In accordance with Minute 53, the Chief Constable reported on two
developments since the l a s t meeting of the Authority. F i r s t l y , the
response of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to a fu ll Criminal
Inquiry to' e sta b lish whether criminal l i a b i l i t y existed had been
announced. The investigation would be carried out by the Chief Constable
of the West Midlands Police and, in the meantime, any fu rth e r comment on
such aspects would be sub-judice. Secondly, in accordance with
Recommendation 26 of the Interim Report of Lord J u s tic e Taylor, he had
appointed the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr P Hayes, as the Designated
O fficer to l i a i s e with the Football Clubs in South Yorkshire. He also
headed the Implementation Teams which had been formed to ensure th a t
everything necessary which had to be done was done.
The Deputy Chief Constable pointed t h a t many of the recommendations of the
Interim Report had been a n tic ip a ted . On the publication of the Interim
Report, the Implementation Teams had concentrated on those recommendations
which required action prior to the commencement of the 1989/90 Football
Season.

Action which had been taken in consultation with Clubs, the County F ire
Service, the Ambulance Service and the Local A uthorities on the sp e cific
subjects of admission of sp ectato rs, the monitoring of crowds in standing
areas, train in g of bath police personnel and club stewards, the provision
of c u tting equipment, lia iso n arrangements, patterns of crowd a rriv a l and
departure, and upgrading of communications systems were outlined. The
w ritten Agreements with the Football Clubs recommended by the Interim
Report had been signed or were due for signature p rio r to the f i r s t league
matches of the season, in consequence of which there would be one system
Force-wide. Inevitably, the increased policing commitments would almost
c e r ta in ly increase the costs re-charged to the Football Clubs.
The Authority queried and discussed c e rta in aspects of the arrangements
reported by the Deputy Chief Constable.

RESOLVED -
1 That the Deputy Chief Constable be thanked fo r the comprehensive
  report now given to the Authority on the implementation of the police-
  rela te d recommendations of the Interim Report of Lord J u s tic e Taylor,
  with p a rtic u la r emphasis on those requiring a tte n tio n p rio r to the
  commencement of the 1989/90 Season.

2 That the Chief Constable be requested to consider holding on a twice
  annual basis the meeting^which have previously been held with the
  South Yorkshire Football Clubs j o i n t l y on j u s t a pre-season b a sis.
