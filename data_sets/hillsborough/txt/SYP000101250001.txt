             I am       a Constable              in    th e    South       Yorkshire          Police,        cur r e n t l y    stationed

             at    Hamrrie r t o n R o a d          Police       Station, Sheffield.

             At    10.00am           (1 0 00 )      on S a t u r d a y ,     15 A p r i l , 1 9 8 9     (150489)        I reported                   for

             duty       in    th e    North         stand      at     the    Sheffield               Wednesday         Football            ground

             for    a    briefing           in      relation          to    the F A   Cup Semi-Final              match        between

            Liverpool           and      Nottingham             Forest.

            When        the    briefing            was      concluded         I went        together        with     Serial          2    to     the

            South        stand.          After         checking        the     seating          area     I then      went       to       the

             turnstile          area        situated           within       the     South       stand      near    to    the     Leppings

            Lane        area    of      the      ground.         At    this       time       I was      with    approximately                  four

            other        constables              on m y       serial,       together          with Police          Se rgeant

            Hemroingway.

             I remained              near     to      the     turnstiles          which       were      open    to N o t t i n g h a m

            Forest           fans     unt i 1 a p p r o x i m a t e l y      2 . 3 0 pm     (1 43 0 )    when     I had        cause        to

            enter        the    uncovered              seating        area     of     the     stand.        From my          position            I

            could        see    the      entire          ground       and     I immediately              noticed        that     whilst              th»

            Spion        Kop and         South         stand     were       almost         fu l l   of N o t t i n g h a m     Forest          fans

            th e    North       stand         and     West      stand       appeared          only      half    full     of    Liverpool

            supporters.                When        I returned          to    the      turnstiles           I commented           on       this        to

            my     colleagues.

I remained       at    the    turnstiles          and a short         time later Sergeant Hemmingway

approached me and informed me that the kick-off could possibly be delayed

as there was a large amount of fans still trying to get into the ground.

Sergeant Hemmingway was the only officer in that area who had a radio in

his    possession.           The    radio was        fitted with an ear piece so I could not

hear any transmissions.

At 3 .05pm (1505) Superintendent Murray came to the turnstile area, he was

running and asked me and my colleagues to follow him if we were free to do

so.     I followed Mr Murray through the uncovered seating area of the South

Stand    and    over    a     small      wall      on   to    the     perimeter      track     of   the     pitch.

Together       with    other        colleagues,         I     followed       him    to   the   Leppings       Lane

terrace area.          It was not until I came within feet of the metal fencing of

the    standing       area       that    I   realised         there    was    a    problem     in   the     centre

section of the terraces.                     I saw immediately that people at the front of

the    terraces were crushed against the metal mesh fencing and were unable

to move.        At    this       time,     most    of   the    fans    although obviously distressed

appeared in order, but I was aware that a teenaged female who was pressed

tightly against the fencing looked very pale and appeared to be unable to

breathe.       She was holding the fence with her hand but she had been pushed

so far forward that her face was pressing through the gaps in the fence.

Together       with    Inspector         Darling        who    had    also    joined     us    I    stood    on   a

concrete ledge on which the fencing is mounted.                                   In this position we were

both    facing the      fans        in   the      terraces     and we were          indicating      to    them to

move back as far as they could.                      We were doing this by using our hands and

also    by   shouting       to     them.       The   fans were shouting back to us                    that    they

were unable to go back.

                                                                                                                                     R457

At    this    time        there       was    only       small          number           of    police           officers        at    the

fence.

I got     down       from       the    ledge       and wa lked               along           the     length       of    t he    centre

section       of    the     terraces.              I could             see    that           by    now a        larger      number         of

fans    appeared           to    be    distressed             and       in     pa in.             The     girl    I had        seen a

short    time       earlier           appeared          to    have          lost        consciousness.                  I again

stood    on     the       ledge       and    looked          into       the       centre           section.            T h e re w a s      no

sign    of    the     crush       easing.           All       the       fans        in       this       section were            packed

tightly       together.

A    number    of     fans       in    the    section             to    the       left        of     the       centre     section

were    becoming           very       angry       and    abusive             to     us       by    this        time.      There       was

no    problem       in t h i s        section.

A    short    time     later          there       appeared             to    be     a    larger           police       presence           in

that    area       and more           police       officers             stood           on    th e      concrete        ledge.            As

fans    started        reaching             out    for       assistance                 police          officers        were        able       to

reach    over       the     fence,          take    hold          of    them        and       drag        them    up a n d      over       the

fence.        At    this        time       I assisted             a    number           of    fans        to    get    safely        over

the    top    of    th e    fencing          and    down          onto       the        perimeter              track.      The       f an s     I

assisted       were        able       to    walk    away          from       t he       area       by     themselves,           although

they    were       obviously           very       frightened                and     shaken           none       appeared        badly

injured.

A    short    time     later          there       were       so       many    police              officers        near     to       the

fencing       that     I was          unable       to    get          back    onto           the     ledge,       so    I went        onto

the    pitch       near     to    the       goal    area.              It w a s         at    this        time    that     I noticed

the    football       game        had       stopped       as          there       were        a    large        number     of       fans

and    police       officers           on    the    pitch.

As    I looked       back        toward       the       terraces             I saw           that       the     blue    gate        which

had    previously           been       closed       was       now       open        and       police           officers        were

carrying       people        from          inside       onto          the    pitch.

I saw    that       two    officers           were       having             difficulty               in    carrying        a youth             so
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                                          R457

 I took       hold        of    his     leg     and       assisted                in   carrying           him    onto        th e     pi tc h.

The     youth       was        very     pale        and       appeared             unconscious.                 We    laid       him      on his

 back.        The        policemen          then         left        to    return        to    the        terraces.              A

 p o l i c e w o m a n who       I do        no t    know           then a p p r o a c h e d         me    and       together            we

attempted           to     revive        th e       youth       -      1 gave          mouth     to m o u t h         resuscitation

whilst        the        other       policewoman               gave        heart        masage.            We    worked          on      the

youth        for    several           minutes            until        a member           of    the        St.    Johns          Ambulance

approached            us.        He    also         tried       to        resuscitate            the       youth         but     after         a

couple        of m i n u t e s        told      us       there        was     no       use    continuing              as    he w a s          dead.

I do     not       know        the    identity            of    t he       youth        but    would        describe             h i m as

follows-           male,       white,         slim        build,           late        teens/early              twenties,             p al e

complexion,              short        ginger/brown                   ha i r w e a r i n g      light        coloured             shirt

(possibly           checked).

After        placing        an       anorak         or    similar           over        the    youths           face       we    left         him

on    t he    football           pitch.             I then           returned           to    th e    Leppings             Lane       terrace

area     and       gave     what       assistance               I could            to    fans        who    were         still        in the

vicinity.

During        this       time        I was     «aware                that     there          were     a    number          of   bodies

laid     on    the       pitch,        however,               when        I later        returned           to       the    football

pitch        the    youth        I had       assisted                had    been        removed.            After          t h e 'dead a n d

injured        had       been        attended            to    I then         together          with        other          members            of m y

serial        asked       fans        who    were         on    th e       pitch        to    gather        together            in on e

area     off       the    grass        and     generally                gave       advice       and        assistance               to   people

who    were        unable        to    find     their           friends            and       relatives.
