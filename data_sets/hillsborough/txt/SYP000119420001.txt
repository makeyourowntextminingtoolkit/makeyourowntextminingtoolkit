                   DHG       where       I shortly           boarded             a    bus    with       other          officers         bound         for    th e

                   F orest.

                   About       1000          hrs     the    same    day          I was       briefed             at    the      ground       together         with

                   all       the    other          officers        on    duty          for       the    football             match.

                   About.      1030          hrs     1 took    my       meal          and    about          1100       hrs      in   company          with

                   Police          Sergeant           2305    Lomas          I attended                at    Middlewood              Road.        Our

                   serial          (No.       2,3)    duty    was       to       patrol          that       road       from      its    junction            with

                   W a d s 1e y L a n e        to     its    junction                with    Minto          Road.          To    prevent         any    clash

                   of    fans       and       prevent        any    disorder                in    the       small          shops     along       that

                   section          of       Middlewood        Road.

                   About       1130          hours     that    day       together                with       PS    Lomas         I paid       particular

                   attention             to    Wadsley        Lane       at          its    junction             with      Mi d d l e w o o d    Road,       as

                   that       corner          appeared        to    be       a       congregating                point       for     the     Liverpool

                   fans       as    many       were        coming       to       the       ground       from          Wadsley        Lane,       after

                   visiting           licensed             premises          and       an    off-licence                   further      up      that    road.

                   About       90%       of    the     fans    that          passed          by    me       were       drinking         intoxicants

                   from       cans       and       bottles     and       also          bottles          of       wine.          Many    were      drinking
t
                   from       open       vessels           obviously             taken       from       the       public         house,         these       I took

                                                                                                                                                      R 303

from     the          fans,           many       I warned             re    their       conditions                 as    in m y            opinion

they     were          drunk           and. w o u l d        be       turned          away     from          the    gates.

Between           about           2    pm    and       3    pm       (1400-1300)              most       of       the    fans          came       down

Wadsley           Lane        in       large          gangs,          chanting          football              slogans,                most       were

worse        for       wear           for    drink.              None       of    the    PCs        on m y         serial             had    a

personal              radio,           only       PS       2303       Lomas       possessed              one.           As       he    was       standing

with     me       I heard              some       of       the       radio       traffic.

About        3    pm     <1500)             that       day       I could          see    what        were          still          hundreds             of

Liverpool              supporters                 in L e p p i n g s         Lane       waiting              to    get       into          the    ground.

Shortly           I heard              a    radio          message          that       led     me    to       believe             that       the       kick

off    had        been        delayed             until          3.15       pm    (1515)        to       allow          the       fans       into       the

game,        before           it       started.              Shortly             after        that       1 heard             a    number          of

messages              <a t    least          three)          from          Supt.       Marshall              to    the       match          control           room

which        sounded              urgent,             to    the       effect          that     he    wanted             the       gates          opening        at

t h e ,L e p p i n g s        Lane          entrance             to    the       West    Stand           because             of       the    large

number           of    Liverpool                 supporters                trying       to     get       in a n d        that          he    feared

that     people              would          be    injured             or    killed        due       to       being       crushed             at       the

entrance.I               now          know       that       eventually                those     gates             were       opened.

Shortly           after           that       I heard             a    radio       message           that          all    available

officers              attend           inside          the       ground          at    t he    perimeter                fencing.                 It    was

obvious           to    me        that       at       this       stage       something              was       drastically                   wrong.

1' w e n t       down        to       the    ground          at       the    Leppings           Lane          entrance                to    the       West

Stand        where           with          other       officers             I was       instructed                 by    an       Inspector

(I    don't           know        who)       to       form       a    cordon          across        the       entrance                to    prevent

any    further               supporters                entering             the       ground.            A    cordon             was       formed        but

there        were        only          a    handful          of       fans       wanting        to       get       in,       which          did       no t

necessitate                  the       large          number          of    officers           there.              I then             heard       a

number           of    messages              to       the    Liverpool                fans,     over          the       ground             tannoy

system           to    move           back       as    people          were       being        crushed             at    the          front       of     the

stand.            During              this       time       the       fans       outside        the          ground          were          becoming

                                                                                                                                                             R3Q3

        aggressive              and       shouting              at    us       because             they       were          not    allowed          into          the

        ground.           Sometime                 later        I went             into       the       ground          into       enclosure             No.          3

        of    the    West           Stand          there        were          about       50       fans       in    the       enclosure             shouting

        and    jumping              up    and       down.            There          were       a    large          number          of    people

        obviously              injured             lying        on    the          pitch       being          attended             to    by    police

        officers          and        St,       John       Ambulance                 personnel.                 X went             onto       the    pitch             and

        assisted               with       first         aid      to       a    number          of       people          with       minor       injuries.

        A    number       of        people          I checked                 showed          no    signs          of       life       and    to    me       as    a

        Both    the       injured              and       dead        were          being       carried             to       the    first       aid       room             by

        then    went           to    the       North          Stand           where       the       situation                was       chaotic„              I
