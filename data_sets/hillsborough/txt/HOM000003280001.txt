 PRESS RELEASE AA17193/2431

                               Hillsborough Inquiry



    The Press Council issued the following finding today:



    Britain s       worst football crowd disaster happened on Saturday,

15 April     1989 when 95 people were killed or fatally injured, many

of them     crushed to death, at Hillsborough Stadium,            Sheffield,     at

the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



    There     was   massive     press and broadcasting       coverage      of   the

tragedy     that    evening    and for the next two days,         and    extensive

coverage for the rest of that week of the aftermath of the tragedy

and public     concern    about    the   explanation of      it    and   possible

responsibility for it.
 Press Release No. AA17193/2431 -- Page 2




        On       Monday 17 April the government announced that there                      would

 be a        public inquiry into the disaster by Lord Justice Taylor                        and

 two assessors.             The        same day the Press Council announced that             it

 would       hold        a general inquiry into photographic coverage                of     the

 tragedy by the press. The decision followed widespread and serious

 public          criticism        of     the publication of pictures    of        spectators

 trapped,          injured        and    dead, and of the alleged conduct           of     some

 photographers             and     other journalists. This criticism          and        direct

 complaint          to     the Press Council continued to grow. By 19 May                   the

Council           had received 349 written complaints from a total of                     3651

signatories.              Among them they named 35 newspapers and included                   56

general           complaints       about the behaviour or contents of the                media

which did not name specific newspapers.



       The        complaints went beyond criticism of photographic coverage

of the           tragedy, and the Press Council broadened the scope of                     its

inquiry to embrace all press coverage.



       As        well as complaints from individual members of the                  public,

some        of     them    relatives or friends of the dead        or    injured           but

others           unconnected       with the tragedy, the Press Council             received

complaints           from many Members of Parliament on their own behalf or

on behalf of constituents. Among organisations which complained to

the Council          were The Football Association,          Liverpool City Council

Hillsborough             Working        Party, Sheffield Methodist District          Synod,

and the          Clergy     Disaster Team of the Oldham Division             of     Greater
Manchester Police.

        On     28    June     the Home Office passed to the      Press    Council         a

 petition           from the Merseyside Area Student Organisation with             some

 7000        signatories       protesting at one aspect of press coverage,           an

 article        in    THE SUN. The petition had been forwarded to the              Home

 Office       by Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. Lord Justice Taylor also

ordered        the     West Midlands Police to make available to the              Press

Council        all     evidence     given to his inquiry which     concerned        the

conduct or coverage of the press. The Council is grateful.

Council were:

       In    each       case the editor was told of the complaint to                      enable

 him or      her to reply directly to the complainant, but all national

newspaper          editors         and editors of some regional newspapers                   which

were      not referred to specifically in complaints were asked by the

Press       Council          for    views   on their       own     and    other     newspapers'

approach          to    picture       coverage of the tragedy and             their      general

views       on     press      coverage      of        disasters.    The    great        majority

responded, often in considerable and helpful detail,                              for which the
Council is grateful.



    Although            the    Council studied and considered               separately        the

picture      coverage          of    all national newspapers and             many       regional

newspapers,            including      all   listed above, it decided               as   it    was

conducting a general inquiry not to make separate findings on each

or to identify the photographic                       coverage of individual newspapers

except           as examples to indicate types of photographs on which                         it
intends to comment.



General principles



    It           is the job of newspapers to report news including                      tragedy

and horror             and     sometimes         to     awaken   public     conscience         or

determination           that tragedy shall not be repeated. There cannot be

a comfortable or pleasing way of doing that when those near to the

events will be under deep grief or emotional stress.
Press Release No. AA17193/2431 -- Page 5




       The        Council        accepts the assurance of many editors that             they

considered              carefully how far it was right to publish          photographs

which        might        serve     a   public interest by    arousing    concern        and

focussing              determination to avoid a similar tragedy but would also

distress              survivors and the families and friends of those who were

killed        and        were     likely to be offensive to      other   readers.        The

decision was hard in very many cases:                  in most of them the Council

believes              editors     were justified in publishing the pictures             they
did.



       The        Council        considered   carefully, as it    has    done    before,

whether           colour reproduction made such a difference to the                impact

of pictures that it might have been justifiable to publish some of

them in black and white but was tasteless or offensive to do so in

colour.           It     decided     that in the case of these pictures         and     the

circumstances                 of this tragedy there was no ethical distinction to

be drawn between colour and monochrome reproduction.



       Similarly,              it concluded that no distinction was warranted            by

whether           a     particular      picture was published on Page 1 or         on    an

inside page.



       The        Council       decided    that no distinction could      properly       be

drawn        in        this    instance between newspapers     which     used   certain

pictures          on      the day of the disaster, the next day in the             Sunday

newspapers,              or    on any of the following days, though        these      were

distinctions cogently argued by some editors.

Specific complaints



       More    than     thirty national and regional newspapers                     published

broad     pictures, taken from a distance, showing a large section of

the crowd       through        the     high steel fence, the front            row     crushed

against       it,     many     of     them    recognisable     and    in   attitudes       of

distress,       pain     and        fear.    Inevitably such       pictures     will     have

distressed          many who saw them:         there was no means of telling             how

many     of those shown died or were seriously injured.                       Nevertheless

the Press       Council believes that publication of these pictures was

justifiable. They were horrific; they portrayed an horrific event.

They     reported      the event accurately and brought home vividly                     the

danger    of a dense crowd under pressure packed behind an immovable

fence.    These photographs showed the horror of the tragedy without

isolating in close-up individuals who were facing death or serious

injury.       The     serious        public    interest      was     served    by      their

publication,         which     was within the discretion of editors                  despite

the added distress it would cause.
 Press Release No. AA17193/2431 -- Page 7




           In    the       Press      Council's view the same cannot be       said    of        a

 smaller number of photographs which it has seen published in a few

newspapers.                In these the focus was on a single individual or very

 small          group          crushed against the fence, sometimes      with    features

cruelly              distorted by its steel mesh. They showed graphically                  the

terror           and in some cases the torture of the persons concerned                     in

images           of       which the mind cannot rid itself. Although it          can       be

argued           the       public interest would be served by their emphasis               on

the danger                of    crowd    and fence, in the Press Council's      view       in

these pictures the intrusion into personal agony and grief was too

gross           to     be justifiable. The Press Council concludes that              these

were        pictures which editors ought to have chosen not to                  publish,

particularly as most newspapers had available the general pictures

which           the Press Council believes they were justified in using. In

those           circumstances           to use intrusive pictures of individuals           as

well        as       or    instead of the general pictures        was    to   accentuate

unacceptably intrusion into grief.



       A        third      category of picture widely published showed           single,

often clearly identifiable,                    individuals lying on the ground, being

treated,             or being carried away. In some cases they appeared to be

dead,           in some the caption implied that they were dead. Newspapers

are free             to    show the injured being treated and it is right             that

they        should,            but   editors   should approach   the    possibility        of

picturing the dead with great care.
 Press Release No. AA17193/2431 —                              Page 8




        There           are     rare      occasions        when       a      newspaper       may    justify

 publishing              an     identifiable            picture of a fatal           casualty           of     an

 accident               or     incident         but     this    has       to    be   judged        on         the

 circumstances                of     each       case. Despite the public nature                    of        this

 disaster,              there       was     no such justification here                 for    publishing

 individual              pictures of men or women who were known or thought                                    to

 be dead           or     dying. Their use was insensitive and the decision                                   of

 some editors to publish them was an error of judgement.



        It     was        thoughtless           of a few newspapers,            some     of    them          the

 subject           of     separate        complaint, to identify                stories       about          the

disaster by the use of a stylised logo echoing a published picture

of a         fatal casualty. These victims may have been identifiable                                         to

family        or friends:              in any event to use such a picture for such a

purpose was to trivialise death.



Conduct of photographers



       Decisions about which pictures to publish lie with editors and

have     been           the     subject of much criticism in public                         comment          and

complaint           to        the    Press Council, but there has                    been     widespread

criticism,              too, about the alleged conduct of photographers on the
scene.



    These           allegations cause the Press Council concern and                                 should

cause        newspapers             concern,          but they have been in            general          terms

only.        The        Council       has received no evidence that enables                         it       to

identify            any       particular         photographer           or     journalist      or         the

representatives                 of        any    particular           newspaper         as     behaving
improperly.
 Press Release No. AA17193/2431 -- Page 9




        There        is, however, clear evidence that to people involved                            in

 the disaster             the        behaviour    of some photographers at             the     scene

 appeared           unhelpful         or    insensitive.     There     was   serious         public

 concern        and       anger       at    the impression     that     photographers             were

 concentrating             on     obtaining close-up pictures of those in                    danger

 and distress             even       at    the risk of hampering rescue work.                it     is

 understandable                that this should have been the perception but                       the

 role     of a press photographer at any incident however tragic is to

 take     pictures of it, not to take part in it - just as the role of

 a reporter is to write about what he sees, not to become caught up
in the event.



        This     could         not relieve a journalist from the humane duty                       of

rendering aid to someone in serious peril if he were able to do so

and no         one    else       could. Nor would any journalist argue                  that       it

should relieve him of that obligation, but that is not usually the

position at major disasters of this type.



    There           the     duty of the journalists on the scene is to                       record

the event           without          impeding    rescue efforts, but they          and        their

editors        also have another responsibility. They should be aware of

the danger           that       photographers going about their proper                  work       of

taking     pictures             of     the injured,    dead or distressed         may        appear

callous        or     insensitive to those involved and by doing so add                            to
their distress.



    The        duty       of     editors in the instructions they               give     and       of

photographers             in the way they behave generally in covering                       major

disasters            is    to    exercise        the   maximum       possible      care           and

understanding for the feelings of all those involved.

 On TRUTH



       An article which gave particular offence to readers,                            including

 the 7,000        who        signed the Merseyside Area Student                Organisation's

 petition, occupied the front page of THE SUN on 19 April four days

 after     the        tragedy, headlined THE TRUTH.              Its subsidiary         headline

 alleged       "Some         fans    picked     the pockets of       victims.        Some     fans

urinated         on    the brave cops. Some fans beat up PC giving kiss                         of

 life.        The article and its headline provoked many protests to the

Press     Council,           some     with     multiple        signatures,      that     it    was

offensive, distressing and insensitive. Appearing as a news story,

it reported           serious allegations about the behaviour of                       Liverpool

fans     by    a named Member of Parliament; by policemen, one of                             them

named and three anonymous; a named nearby resident,                            and an unnamed
neighbour.



    Although           it     said        the named policeman stressed that             only     a

small     minority of Liverpool fans behaved "so badly", the                            article

was generally               one-sided,       offering     no     other    counter       to     the

allegations           it included. Whether or not any of these                   allegations

can be     sustained,           the       article was unbalanced         and    its     general

effect     misleading.              The    headline      THE    TRUTH    was    insensitive,

provocative and unwarranted. THE SUN's own ombudsman declared that

the article should not have been published in the form in which it

appeared. The Press Council condemns its publication.



    Although           THE     SUN's       article attracted       particular        criticism

similar       allegations           were     reported,    sometimes with         a     lack    of

sensitivity,          in other newspapers.

 Comment articles



       Three       examples         of     another type of article       which     were       the

 subject       of specific criticism to the Council were those by Edward

Pearce       and      Auberon        Waugh     in THE SUNDAY TIMES       and     THE       SUNDAY

TELEGRAPH          respectively,           and by Richard Littlejohn of the            EVENING

STANDARD.        All        three        were clearly comment    articles       giving       the

writer's        own     view        of     the events to which    they     referred.         The

Council        has     said      as a point of principle         that     columnists         and

observers        are        free to comment on affairs and newspapers free                       to

publish their comments, making clear that this is what they are.



       The     freedom       to comment embraces publication of                deliberately

challenging           and    provocative        views,   but    editors     should         weigh

carefully            how far to exercise that freedom in the face                 of        deep

tragedy        when     it    may        appear distasteful.     National      tragedy        or

disaster        is     not an occasion for writers to             exercise       gratuitous

provocation,           but    it was within the discretion of the editors                     of

the three newspapers to publish the columnists' articles they did.



Cartoons



       Three     cartoons which gave offence to some readers were                          drawn

to the Council's attention. They were drawings by Gaskill in TODAY

comparing            the price      of stadium     safety with the cost of             a    star

player;        Mahood in THE DAILY MAIL            showing the FA Cup running               over

with    woe;and a black             picture by Garland in THE INDEPENDENT of                 a

goal net torn in skull-like holes.

    Cartoons           are     not    always intended to amuse or to         poke     fun.

Artists        have often used them to make a sharp or bitter point                    and

the Press           Council     accepts that they were free to do so            on    this

occasion.

    In the course of the Council's inquiry it was greatly assisted

by many        of     the letters from members of the public.           It     was    also

helped     by        the     ready    response    of   editors   in   explaining      the

decisions           they     made. The Press Council will consider whether              it

would     be        useful     to    publish some of these in a       record     of   the

inquiry.
