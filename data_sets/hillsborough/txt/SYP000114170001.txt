    shouting          football           chants.            Constant              complaints             were      received             from       the

    was     obvious             that    many       were       drunk.

    had     tickets         caused           pandemonium             with         people          running       about            seeking        this

  solid with           Liverpool             supporters,                these       supporters                were       venting        their

  anger       on a n y P o l i c e       officer           they         saw,       including             this       Special?          who

  instead        of    keeping          his       mouth        s hu t    and       getting          out       of    the    way Walk ed

  in a m o n g      the     supporters             and     was        replying           to w h a t        wa s     being       said     to

  him.        I felt        that       there       was     every         danger          t hat      due       to    this       S p e c i a l ’s

  action       a serious           violent          incident             could       have          developed             and would

  have,       were     it    not       for    the     presence              of     the    dog       vans.           Whilst        this

  crowd was           passing          I got       th e    impression               from       their          actions          that     there

  was    a strong           1 i k e 1 ihood        t hat       trouble           would        develop and                that     myself

  and    other        officers,          being        greatly            outnumbered,                   would       have       been

  seriously           assaulted          but       luckily            for     us    they       passed wi tho ut                  incident.

  After       the     fans       had    passed        by we           located        a sergeant                and       after

  attending           at    the    Leppings          Lane         gate,          finding           no    one       the re,      we

  ventured          to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane     to a w a i t          instructions.                     We    were

  eventually           transported                back     to D o n c a s t e r          at    about          7pm.

  In    conclusion           I would          like        to    say      that       I h av e        in m y         service        performed

  d u t y at     numerous          events          involving             large       crowds             but    on       this    occasion

  there       seemed        to    be    a greater              volume         of    alcohol             in e v i d e n c e      on this

  occasion          than     in    the       past.
