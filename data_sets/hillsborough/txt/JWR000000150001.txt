            Dear

            Please find enclosed a photocopy of my efforts to edit the various
            contributions which you have so kindly provided for the review article
            on the medical response of Sheffield to the Hillsborough Tragedy.

            This is very much a draft.   The document is now on a word processor,
            so that changes can be easily made, so please feel free to tear this
            first draft apart.

            I would particularly value you your thoughts on your own contribution
            but also on the final part of the document on the lessons to be learned.
            I realise that   there are many lessons which I have not put down, but
            I feel we have   to be slightly careful in what we say, bearing in mind
            that the Public Enquiry is in progress.

            I am thinking of having a meeting of all the contributors to the article
            in the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General Hospital
            at 12.30p.m. on Friday the 26th May to try and finalise the document.
            I would be very grateful if you could let me know if you can attend on
            that day and I will try and arrange some coffee and sandwiches.
            However, if you cannot attend, please do not hesitate to give me a ring
            in the department, or better still, do come up to the department and
            then we can discuss the draft in more detail.

            I look forwardto seeing you all on the 26th,    if not before.


            Yours sincerely,
                                                                             1

                                  1
        Saturday the 15th of April was a fine sunny day. The
perfect day to take the kids to the park,    mow the lawn or
go to a football match.     At 15.00 play commenced in   the
F.A.  Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest.   At  15.06 the match was stopped by the referee due
to what appeared to be some crowd trouble. For some minutes
the exact nature of the trouble was not clear even to those
in the ground and certainly no-one realised that they were
witnessing the worst disaster at a sporting event in this
country in recent times.




                            2
At the Ground.

         The first medical aid to the casualties came from
t doctors and nurses attending the match as spectators. There
  were two main areas with large numbers of casualties.   The
  most obvious problem was on the terraces but there was
  also a major incident in the access tunnel to the terraces.
  Five or six doctors and some nurses began resuscitation on
  the pitch while two doctors and a nurse struggled to help
  the large number of casualties from the tunnel. During this
  period there was no resuscitation equipment available.
  Makeshift stretchers were made from advertising hoardings.
        Within 25 to 30 minutes most of the casualties were
  removed from the terraces and the tunnel. Thus there was an
  overwhelming   number of casualties presenting to       the
  emergency services within a very short space of time.  Many
  victims were carried accross the pitch to a large sports
  hall behind the stand.

          Local radio broadcast an appeal for doctors to go to
   the ground and between 15 .30 and 15.45 about 20 doctors
   arrived in the sports hall.      They began treating the
   injured,some requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and
   others with chest     or limb injuries.    Their emergency
   equipment   soon ran out due to     the large numbers of
   casualties.   At about 15.45 the major accident equipment
   arrived in the sports hall and the medical staff were able
   to use the airway care apparatus and to set up intravenous
   infusions. By 16.15 most of the casualties had been removed
   to hospital.




                               3
The Accident and Emergency Departments

          The A/E departments of the Northern General Hospital
   (NGH)  and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital       (RHH) both
   implemented their major disaster plans      shortly before
   15.30. The first casualties were evacuated to the NGH since
   this hospital was the closest.

   The NGH.
         The A/E consultant arrived at the NGH just after
  15.30   to find three patients already    in the resuscitation
  room having come in as cardiac arrests.        These patients
  were being treated by the two A/E senior house officers
  (SHO), an anaesthetic SHO and the paediatric SHO.        There
  were three other less seriously injured patients in the
  department.
           Almost   immediately a second wave of ambulances
  arrived with a large number of     serious casualties.     Some
  were      receiving     cardiopulmonary     resuscitation,some
  unconscious and others were fitting.     Fortunately the A/E
  department was well designed to cope with these           large
  numbers of patients requiring resuscitation.      At one time
  there   were    at least 18 patients       requiring    urgent
  resuscitation, airway care or control of convulsions.
         Many other patients were arriving complaining of
  difficulty breathing or pelvic and back pain with injuries
  sustained in the crush. Most of these patients were triaged
  to direct to the receiving ward adjacent to the A/E
  department.
         About 15.40 there was a request for a mobile team
  to go the the ground.      Two doctors were along with the
  major accident equipment and the department's flying squad
  equipment.
         Seriously ill casualties were still arriving and
  there     were    many   more   patients    requiring    urgent
  resuscitation. At this point those patients with no cardiac
  output were triaged as dead,    a difficult decision in young
  people whose only injury was asphyxial hypoxia.
         During the first hour the department received 87
   casualties    . 14 patients were intubated ,ventilated and
  admitted to the intensive care units . Resuscitation was
  attempted in at least six patients presenting in cardio­
  respiratory arrest. Two of these patients were admitted to
  intensive care . In total 11 victims were either brought in
  dead or resuscitation in the department failed.
             During this period the department also dealt with
  five other emergencies including anofther cardiac arrest
  not related to the Hillsborough Disaster/'Chafc^also required
  intensive care.

The Intensive care units.

           The NGH has two intensive care units the General
Intensive care (GICU) and the cardiothoracic intensive care
(C I C U ) . As the incident occurred at a weekend there was
only      one   patient who could not be moved         out    of
intensive care. Thus the units were cleared to make way for
the influx of casualties.
           The first patient    was received at 16.30   and by
17.30 ten patients had         been admitted to GICU.   These
patients were already intubated and required ventilation.
The GICU was then full and a further five patients were
admitted to the CICU,the last one arriving about 18.30. One
further patient was admitted to CICU with a pneumothorax
and severe chest pain but he did not require ventilation.
           The major problem was the treatment of hypoxic
cerebral damage caused by traumatic asphyxia. The treatment
 of the hypoxic cerebral damage which had been started        in
the A/E department was continued.            This consisted of
ventilation to maintain good oxygenation and an arterial
pCO, of between 3.5 and 4 kPa.             Fluids were closely
restricted       and mannitol and frusemide were used         if
necessary. Fits were controlled with anticonvulsants.
       Four    of the m o s t s e r i o u s l y i n j u r e d w e r e transfered
to the R H H for CT scans to rul e out i n t r a c r a n i a l bleeding.
       The   majority of the patients        showed signs of
inhalation   of    stomach   contents    and    were  treated
aggressively with antibiotics. One patient developed a mild
chest  infection but no patient developed adult respiratory
distress syndrome.
       Five patients developed pneumothoraces and         one
patients had a corneal abrasion.      One patient developed
hypotension and a rigid abdomen and had a laparotomy but
this proved to be negative.
       Two of the fifteen ventilated patients had been
resuscitated from cardiac arrest.     One died shortly after
admission and the other was declared brain dead some days
after admission.
      This incident was a severe test of the ability of the
ICU's to cope with large numbers of patients arriving with
a very short timespan.   There was a rapid response form all
ITU staff.   28 anaesthetists attended along with large
numbers of intensive care nursing staff and operating
department assistants (ODA) . Most of these staff came into
hospital on hearing of the incident through the media.    The
large numbers of staff allowed each patient to be attended
to by one doctor and any patient requiring transfer were
accompanied by an anaesthetist and an ODA.

         rhh and results
Secondary Triage.

        At the NGH those patients with significant injuries
on initial triage were taken to the designated major
accident receiving ward which is adjacent to the A/E
department.    For the first 30 minutes of the incident all
experienced staff were required in the resuscitaion rooms.
A senior registrar briefly checked that each patient was
conscious with no major respiratory or cardiovascular
compromise.
        As the situation in the A/E department     stabilised
the emphasis changed to the accurate assessment of the
patients on the ward.       The mechanism of injury was not
clear in the     initial   stages of the assessment.       The
patients histories suggested crush injury and for that
reason repeated examinations were made to rule out visceral
and limb injuries.
        A senior member of staff was given charge of each
bay of 6 patients and directed the efforts of other staff.
The most urgent of the early problems was the sudden
neurological deterioration in some patients.    Four patients
required rapid sequence induction and ventilation.      These
patients were then transferred to the intensive care
units or to the RHH for CT scans.
        Many patients had chest pain and pain on breathing.
Most of the chest Xrays were normal.     One patients had an
arch aortogram since a widened mediastinum was seen on the
chest x-ray.
    There was anxiety that some patients might develop
delayed respiratory complications but the anaesthetic staff
performed ward rounds using the combination of clinical
examination and pulse oximetry to monitor patient progress.
      Many patients had abdominal pain but a combination of
clinical examination,    ultrasound and peritoneal     lavage
enabled the conservative management of these patients.
        The General Surgical,   Orthopaedic , and Anaesthetic
staff made repeated ward rounds over the next 24 hours to
ensure that no significant injuries were overlooked.     Many
had severe bruising often involving the genitalia.       This
appeared to be a result of being cruched against barriers.
Similar    bruising involving the back musculature        was
encountered.    One patient had severe pain from traction on
the brachial plexus.     He had been trampled while     lying
against a barrier.
        The majority of the ward admissions were discharged
home within 48 hours.     Four    patients required furhter
convalescence    and they were transferred to        hopitals
nearer to their homes.
X-RAY

       The x-ray department of the NGH faced very heavy
demands during the early stages of the incident.   Well over
200 films were taken in the first six hours.     Five rooms
were   used as well as mobile apparatus       in the     A/E
department,  on the wards and in the ICUs.    As the films
emerged from the processor they were inspected by two
radiologists and hand written reports attached to each
film.
            Ultrasound      was   used   in   the   evaluation   of   some
a b d o m i n a l injuries.
       There were few abnormal findings. Only four patients
had visible rib fractures.     7 patients   showed changes
compatible with aspiration into the lungs.   There was one
skull fracture. There were no long bone fractures.




                                     7
Traumatic asphyxia

        Traumatic   asphyxia is an uncommon and usually
sporadic medical emergency but 19 patients suffering from
severe asphyxia were admitted through the A/E department of
the NGH.    The mean age was 19.6 years.
      Many    patients   on    arrival    exhibited    extreme
restlessness,confused agitation,     whole body shivering and
screaming in the so called " encephalitic manner".      Unlike
other hypoxic cerebral insults some patients developed a
progressive worsening of signs long after the initial
trauma.   This late onset was very misleading. One young man
initially appeared to be slightly dazed but otherwise
conscious    suddenly started to scream an hour          after
admission.    The screaming lasted for several         minutes
followed by status epilepticus and coma . This pattern was
observed in another patient 1 hour 30 minutes after
admission.   One other patient became confused and lost his
vision 2 hours 30 minutes after admission.          Subsequent
examination confirmed the diagnosis as cortical blindness.
        14 of the patients had fits.   These took the form of
status epilepticus and although they were partly controlled
by intravenous diazepam . The definitive treatment was
intubation and ventilation.     The patients also received
dexamethasone soon after arrival.
      Two patients     did not have fits but the degree of
agitation prompted early treatment and ventilation.
      Three patients were transferred from the receiving
wards to the RHH .      The sudden deterioration described
above raised the possibility of an intra-cranial bleed and
urgent CT scans were requested.    All of the CT scans were
negative. Pour patients were transferred from the intensive
care units to the RHH for the same reason.

recoveries              and two p a t i e n t s g o o d r ecoveries.              A t this time

function.

The Relatives

       The nature of the tragedy and the proximity of the
football   stadium to the hospital meant that very quickly
large numbers of people arrived seeking information about
their    friends and relatives.  The hospital staff canteen
was used to accommodate these people and soon a crowd of
250   to 300 people had gathered       ,all desperate    for
information.    In the early stages there were real problems
in identification of the victims.   The dead and unconscious
were on three     sites,  most of the injured arrived     in
hospital wearing only t- shirts,jeans and gym shoes. A
senior manager took charge of this        situation and as
information became available he had the onerous task of
trying to distribute this to the crowd.    Large numbers of
nursing staff,   chaplains and social workers also helped in
this task. Many of the relatives had to be transported back
to the stadium to identify the dead.

The press

       The event attracted large numbers of the press and
by and   large they acted with great responsibility.   They
were   given facilities and    information as it     became
available and once the clinical     situations were under
control the some patients consented to be interviewed and
the appropriate arrangements were made.

      The major injury was traumatic asphyxia leading a
hypoxic cerebral insult.
       Six   patients at time of writting still        have
significant neurological disability.
      There were 5 patients with pneumothoraces.
      One patient had a profound brachial plexus injury.
      There were a large number of soft tissue crush
injuries of varying severity.     There were no long bone
fractures.
      Formal injury scoring was not carried out since there
is as yet no Abbreviated Injury Score for traumatic
asphyxia.

The lessons
       This incident is the subject of a Public Enquiry and
many of the major lessons of this disaster will be examined
in great detail by this Enquiry.  We would not like to pre­
empt this process but there are a number of other important
points need discussion.

         As     in   almost   every   other   major   incident
communications were a major problem.
         Communications at the ground were difficult.   Unlike
many other recent major incidents there was no definite
beginning to the incident such as a plane or train crash
where it is fairly obvious from the outset that there is a
high likelihood of large numbers of injuries.       The first
real    indication that something was wrong was of people
spilling onto the pitch. Even at this point the seriousness
of the event was not clear.     Some doctors in other parts of
the ground left at this point since it appeared that the
game had been abandoned due to crowd trouble.
         It was not apparent      that there were two major
incidents the more obvious on the terraces but also the
equally serious but concealed event in the tunnel beneath
the stand.      Lack of adequate communication lead to some
delay in treatment of the casualties in this area.
         The first doctors on the scene had no equipment to
help with the resuscitation of the injured.       This led to
great frustration since all that could be done for the
critically ill was basic first aid.
          The large numbers of casualties that were evacuated
 in a short time span lead to confusion and difficulties
with triage at the scene of the incident.
          There were also communications problems       in the
 hospitals.There was no clear notification that there as a
 major incident.      The cascade call out system depended on
 junior medical staff informing their superiors. However the
 lack of clear information and the sudden influx of large
 numbers of patients requiring resuscitation meant that the
 junior doctors were involved in urgent clinical work and
 did not have time to make the relevant calls.      Fortunately
 because of the media nature of the event large numbers of
 staff arrived with great speed by-passing the cascade
 system.
    The     incident was very different from many        recent
 disasters     in the nature of the injuries.       Most major
 disasters     involve surgical problems.   Most major accident
 plans give the consultant physicians some role but most of
 the     detailed instructions are for the surgical         and
 anaesthetic staff.      The main onus of the treatment of the
 most seriously injured in this *incident fell to the
  intensive     care department and the physicians.       Major
  accident plans should include definite roles for consultant
  physicians .
           The unusual nature of the injury was also a problem


                              11
in the early management of the incident since many of the
staff had a "mental set" that the injured patients all had
"head  injuries".   It took some time for senior staff to
explain the nature of the problem.          Fortunately the
principles    of treatment were appropriate      for     both
problems.
       As mentioned large numbers of staff arrived to deal
with the acute dramatic incident.   One important management
point is that definite plans should be made to give support
over the next few days to those departments worst affected.
The anaesthetic department was highly organised      in this
issue and     once the clinical situation was under control
rotas were drawn up to utilise the large numbers of staff
volunteering.   This process   should be included in major
incident plans.                                         ^ «
       Recent major incidents have highlighted the need for
counselling after such events.Hospital staff were quickly
and efficiently     given such help . However some groups,
especially those involved in the care at the ground may         .
have had the opportunity for counselling .

            Dear Colleague,

            Please find enclosed a further draft of the proposed paper on the Hillsborough
            Tragedy.

            The draft has been amended to include the Accident and Emergency response
            from the Hallamshire but also to remove the contribution from the Doctors
            on the ground, since the contributors felt that they did not wish it to
            appear that they were part of a co-ordinated response.

            I hope to see you all in the Accident and finergency Department, Northern
            General Hospital at 12.30p.m. Friday 26th May.    Specifically, could I ask
            you to try and think of an appropriate ending to the article and also
            consider the draft letter of consent for publication, which I also enclose.

            Yours sincerely,

            Dear Sir,

            We would be grateful if you could consider the paper HThe Hillsborough

            British Medical Journal.   Although the authors listed below all had
            important parts to play in the management of this tragedy, the article is
            really a distillation of the experience of over a hundred medical students,
            junior Medical Doctors, Consultants and General Practitioners, who were
            involved with the treatment of the victims of this Major Incident.
                                                                                             ''I
            We would therefore ask if you would consider publishing the article with
            the authors listed as**1he Staff of the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield
            and The Staff of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield** with the
            address for correspondence being MThe Chairman of the Hospital Medical

since         it a p p e a r e d that the g a m e had been a b a n d o n e d du e                 to

   physicians .
                 The       unusual n a t u r e of the injury w a s als o a p r o b l e m
   in      the e a r l y m a n a g e m e n t of the i n c i d e n t s i n c e m a n y of          the
   staff had a "mental set" that the injured p a t i e n t s all                                  had
   "head         injuries'*.              It      took s o m e time for s e n i o r      s taff    to
   expl a i n        the       nature           of      the   problem.        Fortunately         the
   principles                of       treatment            were  appropriate           for       both
   problems.
                 As      m e n t i o n e d large n u m b e r s of staff arrived to deal
   with the a c u t e drama t i c incident.                       One i m p o r t a n t fi^-'-agement
   point is that d e f i n i t e plans should be m a d e to give s u p p o r t
   over the n e x t few day s to those d e p a r t m e n t s worst affected.
   The       anaesthetic                d e p a r t m e n t was highly or g a n i s e d    in    this
    issue         and         onc e the clinical s i t u a t i o n was u n d e r            control
   rotas          were drawn up to u t i l i s e the large n u m b e r s of                    staff
   volunteering.                  This        process        should be included          in    m ajor
    incident plans.
                  In this i n c i d e n t one of the most d i f f i c u l t tasks was
    the       i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of p a t ients and the          d e a d . One       recent
    innovation was the u s e of polaroid p h o t o g r a p h y . T h i s did not
    take place in the hospital but some thou g h t should be given
    of using this method in o ther mass c a s u a l t y situations.

   received           a m e s s a g e at 15.20      " to stand by to ex p e c t
   casualties". This form of w o r d s m e a n s n o t h i n g in either

   The NGH.
           The Accident and Emergency Department   implemented
  the Major Incident proceedure on the arrival of the first
  casualties at 15.27.
           The A/E consultant arrived at the NGH at 15.33 to
  find three patients already   in the resuscitation room having
  come in as cardiac arrests. These patients were being treated
  by the two A/E senior house officers (SHO), an anaesthetic SHO
  and the paediatric SHO. There were three other less seriously
  injured patients in the department.
          Almost  immediately a second wave of ambulances
  arrived with a large number of serious casualties.      Some
  were     receiving    cardiopulmonary     resuscitation,some
  unconscious and others were fitting.    Fortunately the A/E
  department was well designed to cope with these large
  numbers of patients requiring resuscitation.    At one time
  there   were   at least 16 patients       requiring   urgent
  resuscitation, airway care or control of convulsions.
         Many other patients were arriving complaining of
  difficulty breathing or pelvic and back pain with injuries
  sustained in the crush. Most of these patients were triaged
  to direct to the receiving ward adjacent to the A/E
  department.
         About 15.40 there was a request for a mobile team
  to go the the ground.     Two doctors were dispatched along
  with the major accident equipment and the       department's
  flying squad equipment.
         Seriously ill casualties were still arriving and
  there    were   many    more   patients   requiring   urgent
  resuscitation. At this point those patients with no cardiac
  output were triaged as dead,   a difficult decision in young
  people whose only injury was asphyxial hypoxia.
         During the first hour the department received 87
   casualties . Many patients were intubated ,ventilated and
  admitted to the intensive care units . Resuscitation was
  attempted in at least six patients presenting in cardio­
  respiratory arrest. Two of these patients were admitted to
  intensive care . In total 11 victims were either brought in
  dead or resuscitation in the department failed.   No patient
  admitted with cardiac output has subsequently died.

Th e RHH.
       The A/E consultant and senior registrar both arrived at
15.37. The nursing staff had already began to prepare the
department to receive large numbers of casualties. At this
time two police officers arrived and confirmed that at major
incident was taking place and the hospital then formally
implemented the major disaster plan.
        The first two patients arrived at 15.40. One was
intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. The
other victim was dead. There was then a period when the
departmental plans could be fully organised.
       At about 16.00 there was a large influx of patients,
many of them on stretchers complaining of crush injuries to
the chest or pelvis and many walking wounded.  A further 24
patients were admitted.   45 patients were discharged after
treatment.  The majority of these patients were suffering
from emotional disturbance and minor soft tissue injuries.
       The last patient was received at approximately 17.00
and the department was clear and ready to receive routine
referrals by 18.15.

on initial triage were taken to the designated major
accident receiving ward which is adjacent to the A/E
department.   For the first 30 minutes of the incident all
experienced staff were required in the resuscitation rooms.
A senior registrar briefly checked that each patient was
conscious with no major respiratory or cardiovascular
compromise.
       As the situation in the A/E department stabilised
the emphasis   changed to the accurate assessment of the
patients on the ward.     The mechanism of injury was not
clear  in the initial    stages of the assessment.      The
patients histories   suggested crush injury and for that
reason repeated examinations were made to rule out visceral
and limb injuries.
              A     senior        m e m b e r of staff w a s g i v e n c h a r g e of    each
bay       of 6 p a t i e n t s and d i r e c t e d the e f f o r t s of o t h e r staff.
The       most       urgent         of      the e a r l y p r o b l e m s was  the     sudden
neurological              d e t e r i o r a t i o n in some patients.         A number     of
p a t i e n t s r e q u i r e d r a p i d s e q uence i n d u c t i o n and v e n t i lation.
These         p a t ients w e r e then t r a n s f e r r e d to the i n t e n s i v e care
u n i t s or to the RHH for CT scans.
       Many patients had chest pain and pain on breathing.
Most of the chest Xrays were normal.   One patients had an
arch aortogram since a widened mediastinum was seen on the
chest x-ray.
    There was anxiety that some patients might develop
delayed respiratory complications but the anaesthetic staff
performed ward rounds using the combination of clinical
examination and pulse oximetry to monitor patient progress.
            Ma n y p a t i e n t s had a b d o m i n a l p a i n but a c o m b i n a t i o n of
clinical          examination,           ultrasound           and  peritoneal          lavage
e n a b l e d the c o n s e r v a t i v e m a n a g e m e n t of these patients.
        The General Surgical,  Orthopaedic , and Anaesthetic
staff made repeated ward rounds over the next 24 hours to
ensure that no significant injuries were overlooked.    Many
had severe bruising often involving the genitalia.      This
appeared to be a result of being crushed against barriers.
Similar    bruising involving the back musculature       was
encountered.    One patient had severe pain from traction on
the brachial plexus.     He had been trampled while    lying
against a barrier.

       In the RHH the designated receiving ward was cleared
by a senior surgeon and physician who were in the hospital
at the time of the incident.   11 patients were complaining
of abdominal pain after having been .crushed against the
barriers.  Six patients had minor neurological symptoms and
the others had significant soft tissue injuries with only
one patient requiring operative treatment,   reduction of a
fracture of the radius and ulna.

     The majority of the patients not requiring intensive
care discharged home within 48 hours from.  Four patients
from the NGH required   further convalescence in hospital
and they were transferred to hospitals nearer to their
homes.




X-RAY

        The   x-ray   department of the NGH faced very heavy
                       arly stages of the incident. Well over

            T his i n c i d e n t is the subj e c t of a P u b l i c E n q u i r y and

empt this proc e s s but t here ar e a n u m b e r of o t h e r i m p o r t a n t
p o i n t s need d iscussion.

              As          in        almost           every         other         major        incident
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s w e r e a m a j o r problem.
              C o m m u n i c a t i o n s at the g r o u n d w e r e d ifficult.                 Unlike
many        other         re c e n t m a j o r in c i d e n t s there wa s             no     definite
beginning             to      the i n c i d e n t such as a p lane or train                        c rash
or      even        the c o l l a p s e of a w a l l as in the H i s s e l                    radjedy.
In such inc i d e n t s it is fairly o b v i o u s from the o u t s e t that
there         is      a h i g h l i k e l i h o o d of large n u m b e r s of                injuries.
Th e      first real i n d i c a t i o n that s o m e t h i n g was w r o n g w a s                    of
people          spilling            o nto the pitch.               E v e n at this         point      the
seriousness               of the e v e n t wa s not clear.                     S ome     doctors       in
other         p arts        of      the g r o u n d left at this                 point       since     it
appeared            that        the      g a m e had b e e n a b a n d o n e d d u e         to    crowd
trouble.
              It      was       not      apparent          that there            were      two     major
inc i d e n t s       the       m o r e o b v i o u s on the t e r r a c e s bu t            also     the
equally           serious but c o n c e a l e d e vent in the tunnel                            beneath
the       stand.          Lack        of a d e q u a t e c o m m u n i c a t i o n lead       to     some
d e l a y in t r e a t m e n t of the c a s u a l t i e s in this area.
              Th e      first d o c t o r s o n the scene had no e q u i p m e n t                     to
help        w i t h the r e s u s c i t a t i o n of the injured.                      Thi s led       to
great         frustration               since        all that could be d o n e                for     the
c r i t i c a l l y ill was b a s i c first aid.
              Th e      large n u m b e r s of c a s u a l t i e s that w e r e e v a c u a t e d
in      a     short time span lead to c o n f u s i o n                        an d    difficulties
with triage               at the scene of the incident.
              There         were        also       communications              problems         in    the
hospitals.There                   was no c lear n o t i f i c a t i o n that there as                    a
major         incident.             Th e     c a s c a d e call out system d e p e n d e d             on
j u n i o r m e d i c a l staff i n f o r m i n g their superiors. H o w e v e r the
lack        of      c l e a r i n f o r m a t i o n and the sudden influx of                       large
n u m b e r s of p a t i e n t s r e q u i r i n g r e s u s c i t a t i o n m e a n t that           the
junior          doctors           w e r e i n v o l v e d in u r g e n t c l i n i c a l w o r k      and
d i d not hav e time to m a k e the r e l e v a n t                        calls.        Fortunately
b e c a u s e of        the m e d i a n a t u r e of the event                   large n u m b e r s of
staff         arrived           with       g r e a t speed         by-passing          the      casc a d e
system.
              L a r e n u m b e r s of v o l u n t e e r m e d i c a l staff a lso a r r i v e d
in      both        hospitals.             T h e y p r e s e n t e d to the p a t i e n t        triage

early         m e d i a c o v e r a g e and w i l l b r i n g m a n y v o l u n t e e r m e d i c a l
