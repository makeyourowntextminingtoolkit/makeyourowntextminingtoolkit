 I am currently working as a Senior House Officer in Anaesthetics. I qualified in Medicine in 1986,

 and since August of 1988, I have been on the Trent Regional Health Authority anaesthetics

 rotation.



 At the time of the incident in question I was employed as an Anaesthetist at Rotherham District

 General Hospital.



 On the afternoon of Saturday April 15th, I was off duty. I returned home from walking the dog at

 around 3.00 pm. I turned on the television to see crowd disturbance at the Hillsborough Football

 Ground. The match appeared to have been abandoned, and the television coverage ceased. I

 listened briefly to a local radio station, who were also reporting a disturbance at the ground.



 As I am familiar with the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, I decided to make my way there

 in case I could be of assistance in the event of casualties being received.



 Due to the location of my house, I almost immediately encountered an ambulance, which I

 assume was on its way to the ground.                   It had its lights & siren on, and I followed immediately

 behind it, with my headlights on.

 As it passed the Herries Rd. entrance, I turned off into the Northern General Hospital.



 I entered the Accident & Emergency Department to be told that a Paediatric "cardiac arrest" was

 expected (via Ambulance Control), and that there was an incident of some kind at the

 Hillsborough stadium. No-one in the department was aware that these two pieces of information

 were related.



 The first casualty arrived within two or three minutes. I believe this patient to be a boy I know

 only as "Lee", who I believe was declared "Brain dead" on the Intensive Care Unit (ITU) the

 following Monday.



 He was in Cardiopulmonary arrest, with fixed, dilated pupils. I intubated him, established venous

 access, and instigated routine resuscitative measures.    His heart had stopped beating, but we

 managed to re-establish him in normal rhythm.



 Whilst I and another doctor were treating Lee, the second victim arrived. He was of similar age

 (around 1 2 - 1 4 years), with blond hair. He was also in Cardiopulmonary arrest. I intubated him,

 and noticed evidence of gross inhalation of stomach contents.       He also had marked gaseous

 abdominal distension, possibly indicating that he had had "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation at some

 time.



 I also established venous access, and gave appropriate drugs. This boy was also established in

 a normal sinus heart rhythm, but his pupils were fixed and dilated throughout, and I believe he

 has since died.



 These two boys had taken up the space immediately available in the resuscitation area, and the

 next patient I dealt with was in the A & E Department Theatre.

 This patient was aged around twenty, with fair hair, of slim build. He was cerebrally irritable, but

 not actually fitting.   I was able to intubate him without any drugs, and left him in the care of

 another doctor.



 I next saw another unconscious, cerebrally irritable patient, with shoulder-length brown hdir, and

 aged around twenty.       I judged his airway to be adequate, and left him in the care of a non­

 medical member of staff.



 The next patient I dealt with was in Cardio-Pulmonary arrest.      He was aged around twenty, of

 stocky build, with ginger hair. I intubated him, and gave appropriate drugs down the endotracheal

 tube, as he did not have any venous access. I was assisted by a doctor of around my own age

 from the football ground. I never discovered his name.



 I resorted to a central venous line via the Right subclavian route in this patient. W e got his heart

 beating in a normal rhythm, and he was ventilated adequately.



 However, he re-arrested on two distinct occaisions, and developed bizzare E.C.G. complexes,

 with a very poor output. At this stage I took the decision to abandon resuscitative measures on

 this patient.



 I next saw a patient of around forty, with thinning hair and of heavy build.         He was having

 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation from another doctor. I intubated the patient to help with this.



  I then was asked to see a boy of around fifteen with black hair, who had already had resuscitative

 treatment.      He was however fitting, and had a poor airway.        I gave this boy appropriate

  anaesthetic drugs to sedate and paralyse him, intubated him, and transferred him to the I.T.U. I

  believe he has since made a good recovery.

 I then performed a virtually identical procedure on a boy of similar age with light brown hair.

 I transferred him to the I.T.U. also. I do not know what has happened to this boy.



 I was then briefly involved with a male of around thirty in the resuscitation room. He had already

 had considerable effort put into his resuscitation, but was still asystolic (ie his heart was not

 beating). I placed a central venous line on this patient. I believe resuscitative measures on this

 patient were abandoned.



 I then went to Ward 60, and performed rapid sequence inductions and intubations on two

 patients who had deteriorated neurologically. I transferred these patients to the Cardiac Intensive

 Therapy Unit.



 I later dealt with a female patient who came into the A & E department having "arrested". She

 was not from the Hillsborough ground. She was transferred to the I.T.U.



 This, I believe, covers the bulk of the work I did on the day of the disaster.



 I left the Northern General hospital at around 9.00 p.m.
