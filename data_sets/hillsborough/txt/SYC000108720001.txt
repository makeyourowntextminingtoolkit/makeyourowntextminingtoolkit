                                                       J;   GRANT


Q. What time did you leave? - A. We were in there I would
   say three-quarters of an hour to an hour, something like
   that.

Q. So you left at about one? - A. Yes.

Q. You then drove towards the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. It was only about a ten minute drive? - A. Yes, we were
   directed by the police.

Q. Then you parked. - A. Yes.

Q. You were directed by the police.    Were you directed as to
   where to park? - A. Yes.

Q. Having parked at about one o'clock you then went to the
   ground? - A. We walked towards the ground, familiarised
   where it was, and then we went to have a drink.

Q. Where did you go? - A. There is a big pub at the back of
   Leppings Lane, that was closed.   There were buses going
   into the town so we got on the bus and got off at the
   first stop and found a pub there.

Q. You don't know the name of that pub? - A. I don't, no.

Q. I think you then had another four or five pints in there?
   - A. About that, yes.

Q. There were a lot of fans in that pub? - A. Mainly
   Nottingham Forest supporters, but there were a few
   Liverpool supporters.

Q. I wasn't asking the colours, but there were a lot of
   people in? - A. It was full.

Q. Was it across a little bridge, this pub? - A. No, it was
   on the main road.   The bus never turned off anywhere, so
   we just got off.

Q.   But you don't remember its name? - A. I don't,   no.

Q.   How longwas the bus ride? - A. Five or ten minutes, not
     very far.   There was a lot of traffic as well on the
     road because it was Saturday afternoon.

Q. Also there was a football match as well? - A. Yes.

Q. You stayed there until about what time? - A. I would say
   between, say, two and quarter past.

Q.   Then you went back to the ground by bus again? - A.Yes.

                                                      J .. GRANT


Q. What time did you get to the ground? - A. I would say it
   was before half past two.    I don't really know.   At a
   guess I would say about half past two.

Q. About half past two at a guess? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got there what was it like? - A. When we got to
   by where the turnstile was it was just a mass of bodies.

Q. Had you ever been to the ground before? - A. I had been
   but it was when we played Arsenal in 1977.

Q. A long time ago? - A. A long time ago.

Q. Can you remember that before you get to the turnstiles
   there are some big blue perimeter gates?   Can you
   remember that? - A. In front of the turnstiles, yes.

Q. You can remember those? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell me first of all when you got there were
   those gates open or shut? - A. I could not really say.
   I think they were shut because when we actually got
   there, as I say there was a mass of bodies and then it
   went down a bit and the gates must have shut again.
   Then all the congestion built up again waiting for those
   gates to open.

Q. So the congestion which you first experienced was outside
   the perimeter gates? - A. Outside the gates.

Q. There were a lot of people.   Did you have room to move
   in that area outside the perimeter gates? - A. When we
   got there, you were standing round, but once you started
   moving towards the turnstiles people started standing
   round, it got congested then.

Q. Did you see any police officers? - A. On horses.

Q. How many did you see, can you remember? - A. I can only
   picture one police horse that was in front.   He was near
   enough by the gates.

Q. He was in front of the gates? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember if he was broadways on or longways on? -
   A. He was longways on, facing us.

Q. Do you recollect whether he was communicating with you? -
   A. He was.

Q. What was he trying to tell you? - A. He was trying to
   "back off” , to try and get a bit of order.
                                                              4

                                                      J   t   GRANT


Q. How close to him were you when you first noticed him
   doing that? - A. I can t really say.   After a while I
   was only a matter of feet away from him.

Q. Were you able to back off at that time? - A. No.

Q. Why not? - A. Because of the congestion, the people
   behind and what have you.

Q. When you first caught a glimpse of him, would you at that
   point have been able to back off? - A. I suppose I could
   have, yes.
Q. The people behind you, did you perceive it as a push
   or... - A. No, it was just the congestion of people
   trying to go in.




                    Q. Apart from shouting
                                                          5


                                       J. GRANT



Q. Apart from shouting "Get back" what else did you see the
   mounted Officer do? - A. There was not very much he could
   do with the people around but he was trying to tell people
   to back off.

Q. You then presumably got through these perimeter gates did
   you? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you aim for a turnstile or not? How did you get into
     the ground? - A.Well once we got inside the gates the
     gates were closed behind us and so we just stood at the
     back to wait for it to go down. We were over to the left
     along there is a wall where there is a big concertina gate.
     There was a number of turnstiles in front of us. We just
     made our way to the left to get in there.

Q. To the turnstiles or to the gate? - A. To the turnstiles
   but as I say once we got to these concertina gates the
   gates just opened.

Q.   Can you put the  picture, 274 I think. We will show it to
     you in there to help you. Can you see that? - A. Yes,
     where it say Gate B there is gates there.  That is the
     actual gate that opened that we walked through.

Q. I see, so you were actually aiming towards the turnstiles,
   you were in the crowd that was going towards the turnstiles?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And then the concertina gates on your side opened? - A. Just
   opened, yes.

Q. And you were able to get through? - A. We just walked through,
   yes.

Q. Now this is interesting, when you were standing before that
   gate opened, how crowded was it as far as your perception
   was concerned? - A. There was still a lot of people actually
   in between the gate and the turnstiles, but as I say we were
   just in the queue, there was a lot of people around us and
   the next thing this gate just opened.  I was not aware of
   how many people were behind me.

Q. What I am trying to find out is how did it feel. Were you
   distressed, in discomfort or anything? - A. No, no.

Q. You were reasonably comfortable where you were? - A. At
   that time.

Q. Did you see anybody else distressed? - A. Not outside.

Q. I am talking about outside? - A. You know there was people
   shouting:  "There is children" and all that, you know.
   That was actually outside the perimeter gates.
                                                           6

                                       J. GRANT



Q. Yes, that is what I mean? - A. But actually inside I
   did not see anyone distressed because I think the pressure,
   once those gates were shut the pressure must have eased
   a bit.

Q. So in other words what you are saying from your point
   of view it was worse outside the perimeter gates than it
   was on the inside of the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Q.   From your point of view? - A. Yes.

Q.   Anyway Gate B opened and you stepped inside, so   to speak.
     - A. Yes.

Q. Having got through that gate where did you then go? - A.
   Well when we walked through we saw the tunnel because there
   is a wall that goes from the actual Stands back towards
   the turnstiles and there was a gap there and we saw the
   tunnel so we headed that way. Actually through this other
   wall there must be a gate as well.

Q.   You can see the plan or go and look at the model because
     you will probably find it easier if you look at the model
     in this particular instance.  Show the young man Gate B
     first of all.  So you came through Gate B, walked along
     that wall, saw that gap and you could see the tunnel? - A.
     Ye s.

Q. And you came through? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you intending to go behind the goal, was that where
   you were aiming to be? - A. Well that was the first time
   I had been there and I had just seen it says the entrance
   and that is where we headed for.

Q. When you say "Entrance" where did you see that? - A. No,,
   we actually saw the tunnel going through so we thought
   that was it.

Q. You did not see any other signs in the corner of the building
   pointing towards the left? - A. No, not really.

Q. Were you in any way hindered by either Police or Stewards
   in coming through that gap? - A. No, not at all.

Q. And did you see people going the other way? - A. There was
   people walking both ways yes actually inside the ground.

Q. And nobody was being stopped from passing backward and
   forward through that gap? - A. No, I never saw anybody.

Q. Not as far as you could see, that is all I am asking you.
   I don't want you to tell me what you did not see, just
   what you saw with your own eyes or heard or felt or thought,
   I suppose, to a certain extent. Right, so you went towards
   the tunnel.  Okay? - A. Yes.

                                       J. GRANT



Q. When you were going towards the tunnel did you by any
   chance notice whether there was another big gate open?
   - A. No, not that I noticed because we were in a hurry
   we were going in and a couple of the lads had to go to
   the toilet because there was a toilet next to the actual
   tunnel so we stood there. We stood there how long they
   were in the toilets and then we just made our own way
   down the tunnel then.

Q. Did you go to the toilet.  Forgive me for asking? - A. No,
   I had already been beforehand.

Q. How long did the lads take? - A. You know, a minute, I
   don't really know.

Q. Did you notice whether the toilets were very crowded? -
   A. Well we just stood outside.  There was people walking
   in and out. We did not actually go inside.

Q. Fair enough.  Did you see the pitch from the tunnel entrance?
   - A. Yes, we did actually look in and we could see the
   players. All you could see was the bottom of their legs.

Q. But you could see the players, that is what I am trying
   to find out? - A. Oh yes, we could yes.

Q. Were the players on the pitch? - A. Yes, they were.

Q. And do you know what they were doing, could you see what
   they were already up to at that point? - A. No not really
   We just had a quick look and we could see the back of
   Bruce Grobbelaar in his goal. We could see his legs.
   Whether the game had started I don't know.

Q. You don't know? - A. No.

Q. So you then went down the tunnel, right? - A. Yes.

Q. I think there were four of you, weren't there? - A. Four
   of us, yes.

Q.   Three friends plus yourself? - A. Yes.

Q.   What sort of passage did you     have downthe tunnel? - A.
     There was people in there but it was not like congested
     because once we got to the end of the tunnel we had a
     look which way we wanted to go so we bore left.

Q. Say that again, I missed that. Could you repeat that?
   - A. When we got to the end of the tunnel we come out
   and we made our way left because we had a look and what
   we could see over the top of the people's heads like the
   left-hand side was pretty empty. We did not know there
   was a fence there till afterwards but I was to go down,
   go left and head over towards like the corner flag.

                                       J. GRANT



Q. When you say the left-side was pretty empty you mean the
   distant part? - A. In the distance because there is a bank
   in the corner as well.

Q. That is the bit that looked pretty empty to you not the
   immediate area? - A. No.

Q. How full did the immediate area look to you? - A. It was
   packed.

Q. Have you been on packed terraces before? - A. Yes, I have even
   been to Wembley where I have been outside the ground,
   actually outside the turnstile an hour before the game and
   not got in till like 20 minutes after kick-off.  I have
   been to a number of matches.

Q. So you have been to some pretty big matches? - A. Yes.

Q. Compared with those how packed would you say the left-hand
   pen, the one that you actually got into was when you first
   looked at it? - A. Well first off it is a usual sight when
   you go to football when you are shepherded into the pens
   but once we tried to make our way through I mean you just
   come to a standstill, you know, it was packed.

Q. Can you remember whether the play, whether they were already
   playing? - A. Yes, the game had started.

Q. It had started when you actually got on to the pen? - A.
   When we were there yes.

Q. When you came out of the tunnel, sorry? - A. Yes.




                      Q. You told me
                                                J.   GRANT




You told me you were trying to move over to the left? -
A. To the left, yes.

We will get you to show us in a minute where you
finished up, but were you actually able to make your
way at all? - A. We did actually go a bit but we just
came to a stop.

You couldn't go any further? - A. No.

At that point were you frightened by the situation? -
A. Not really. We just thought it would ease itself
out, with people coming in it is usual, and it just
settles itself out once the game starts.

What happened then? - A. When we came to a standstill I
noticed in front of me there was a man doubled over, so
we picked him up and when I looked at him you could
tell he wasn't there, he was pale, and looking at his
eyes, so we picked him up and then as I picked him up
he was sick all over me. Then the crush came, like
there was a bit of a push and we were jostled around,
then I lost this man and then the big push came and
luckily enough for us, for me personally, because we
were heading left we were going down at   an angle, and I
went down and away to the left.

How did you get out, just tell me that? I am jumping
ahead a little bit? - A. After the game?

Yes - did you climb over, did you come out of the
tunnel? - A. No, where I was I just stood my ground and
then it was 20 minutes, half an hour afterwards that I
left.

The chap whom you have mentioned who appeared to you to
be doubled up and who looked obviously very sick, was
he an older or a younger man, can you remember? - A. He
was older than me, about 35, something like that - I
wouldn't know.

You apart from that glimpse of him you lost sight of
him and you don't know what happened to this chap? - A.
No.

You have mentioned that you were coining  to a stop, you
could see this chap ahead of you, and then 1 think you
said that there was a push and then there was a real
big push. Try and describe that to me in a little bit
more detail. - A. We picked this man off the floor, he
was doubled over, and we were talking to him, asking
him if he was okay and we were getting no response from
him, and then there was a little bit of a surge, like
jostle, maybe it was people that were just around me, I
                                                J.   GRANT




don't know, and I lost him because he fell. Then the
big surge came and I was just carried off my feet.
There wasn't nothing I could do.

That surge actually carried you to where you finished
up at the end? - A. It was just in the lap of the gods
where I landed.

You could not do anything about it? - A. No, I couldn't
do nothing.

And that surge came from behind you, did it? - A. Yes.

Can you recollect, was anything happening on the pitch
that you can relate to this surge? - A. Afterwards or
before?

When this big surge came what time was it? What I am
trying to find out is what time it was when the big
surge came? - A. The game was in progress, and after it
there was a lot of shouting and screaming and there was
people trying to climb over the fence and getting told
to go back.

No, we will come to that in a minute. We have not got
to that point yet. I am still on the surge. - A. At
that surge I didn't know what was going on.

Did you see Beardsley hit the crossbar? - A. No.

In your statement you said it was at 4-minutes-past-3?
- A. Around that time.

But you don't know really? - A. I don't know.

That was a guess? - A. Yes.

It doesn't matter, I am just trying to see on what
basis you said that. You didn't look at your watch? -
A. No.

You didn't see what was happening on the field? - A.
When the surge came I could have been thrown round, I
don't really remember.

Now we come to the fencing. When you hit the crowd and
were stationary, before this surge, before this big
surge which moved you down, could you see people
climbing the fences? - A. Before the surge?
Yes. - A. No.

After the surge? - A. Yes, there was people trying to
get out.

Q. Tell me what you saw then? - A. I seen people climbing
   over, because the fence comes back onto you, they were
   trying to get over and they were told to get back and
   were getting pushed back in.

Q. Could you hear that? - A. I could hear people. Because
   there was a lot of screaming I couldn't actually hear
   people saying, "No, you can t get out” , because there
   was a lot of screaming going on and people shouting.
   There was people climbing the walls back into the
   stands, but I did see people getting pushed back in by
   the Police.

Q. How many did you see? - A. How many Police or people?

Q. People being pushed back. - A. There was a lot.        People
   were trying to get out, it was panic.

Q. Did you see the little gate at the front? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see it open or shut? - A. I couldn't say.

Q. It didn't impinge on your consciousness? - A. No.

Q. I think you also saw the crowd and Police trying to
   pull the fencing down eventually, didn't you? - A. That
   was when they realised the extent of what had gone on,
   yes. The Police and the actual supporters were pulling
   the fence away from where it is welded to get people
   out.

Q. One of the things you were not happy about was the
   allocation, wasn't it? You wanted the other end,
   didn't you? - A. It speaks for itself, the support
   Liverpool has.

Q. One final point on this business of people being pushed
   back. You are quite satisfied in your mind that this
   happened after the big surge? - A. What was that?

Q. When people were trying to climb over the fence, you
   saw that after the surge? - A. After the surge, yes.

Q. We will get you to show us two positions.  If you go to
   the overhead projector there, put a circle in the
   position where you came to rest when you hit the crowd,
   before the big surge, where you saw this chap doubled
   up, then show me with a cross when the surge came and
   you were carried forward, where did you finish up? - A.
   I would say roughly either just at the side or I am not
   really sure, inside this barrier. I could not really
   tell. I should imagine it would be this side.
   (The witness marked and signed Exhibit 342)
                                               J.   GRANT




So you were not carried that far but you were carried
towards the left, that is right, isn't it? - A. As I
say, the amount of people that were in there ....

I am not blaming you. One final question from me, I
think, when you came to the position which you marked
with the cross - can you see that? - A. Yes.

Were you frightened at that position, for your life? -
A. Afterwards, yes.

When you say afterwards, what do you mean? - A. After
the surge, yes.

Up to the surge you were not frightened. You were
crushed and crowded, but you were not frightened, is
that right? - A. Yes, I was a bit upset at what had
happened, trying to get my bearings after what had
happened, yes.

But after the surge you were a bit frightened for your
own life? - A. Yes.

And fortunately, of course, you are here - I am pleased
for you.

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Just go back to your arrival outside the ground, when
you had passed through the perimeter gates and you were
on the approach to the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

You have explained that the way you saw it, the crush
outside the perimeter gates was worse than the crush
between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles. - A. I
think the gates were actually closed just behind me so
the pressure had eased off, but there was still a bit
of jostling going on, people were picking which
turnstile to go to, and we were on the left hand side
along the wall.

                                                J. GRANT


Q. Can I ask you this; from what you have just said,
   from the way you saw it, closing the perimeter gates
   was helpful to the people who were immediately
   outside the turnstiles because it eased the pressure
   on them? - A. I would say that, yes.

Q. When you first got into the ground and first got into
   the pen, you said that it was packed? - A. Yes.

Q. When you were being first asked about that you
   referred to your experience at Wembley? - A. And
   other football games, yes.

Q. Is that because you want to draw a comparison or it
   is fair to draw a comparison between what you saw
   then on arrival in the stand? - A. Yes.

Q. And what you had seen on other occasions? - A. What I
   have seen on other occasions, some are the same,
   similar sort of circumstances what have happened
   like.

Q. That is how it looked to you when you first went into
   the pen? - A. On the actual terraces.  I have been to
   many games where they are packed.  There are a lot of
   people congest behind the goals.

Q. You mean packed in a similar way to what you saw
   when you first went in? - A. I would say beforehand
   but not once it actually...

Q. It got worse? - A. It got worse, the extent of it.

Q. Quite but I am only interested at the moment when you
   first went in. The players were on the field? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The match had not started? - A. Once we got through
   the tunnel the game started, yes.

Q. At just about kick-off time is when you are speaking
   about? - A. Yes.

Q. Tell the Jury about these other matches you have been
   to and these other occasions you are drawing this
   experience from? You have told us about Wembley? -
   A. Yes, I have been to Wembley a number of times,
   nearly every season virtually, and other Semi Finals.

Q. Where? - A. White Hart Lane I have been to. There
   was congestion there and other League games as well.

Q. I know it is difficult to think. - A. Yes.

Q. Keep going though because you are an experienced
   chap? - A. I would say the Wimbledon game which I
                                                                  14

           thought was ridiculous because I have still got the
           actual full ticket for that game.  That was the
           final.

        Q. What is the point about having the full ticket? - A.
    B      They let us through the turnstiles on that occasion.

        Q. Why? - A. Because of the congestion outside the
           ground.  If you go to Wembley, to get to the
           turnstiles there is a mass of steps and I was at the
           bottom of those steps an hour before kick-off and it
           was like quarter past, twenty past, three something
           like that before I had actually got on the terraces.

        Q. If it had not been for this disaster which happened
           at Hillsborough when the extra push came, do you
           understand that, the big push which you have told us
           about? - A. Yes.

        Q. If it had not been for that big push, otherwise does
           what happened measure up to what happened at other
           matches you have been to? - A. As I say, it was bad
           because everyone, it seems to me, was headed towards
           those two pens and like other grounds you go to are a
           lot bigger - I don't know - it was one of the worst I
           have been to.

        Q. Finally, about your drink, can you just bring it
           altogether? By the time you arrived at the ground
           how much had you had to drink? - A. I would say about
           six pints.

        Q. You were with three others, were you? - A. Yes.

        Q. Were the three others the same age? - A. Roughly,
           yes.

        Q. Had they had about the same? - A. Yes.

        Q. Is that a normal amount to drink before going to a
           big match? - A. We go to football anyway and I will
           have about four or five pints.  That is for the home
           game, you know.

                       Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

        Q. Mr. Grant, so that we can see this in perspective,
           that five or six pints, about six pints, was drunk in
           a period from some time just after twelve to some
           time just after two? - A. Yes.

        Q. When you went through the tunnel and you got to the
           end of the tunnel you could see that there was space
           on the left hand side? - A. On the left hand side of
           the terraces, yes.

Q. That was where you intended to go? - A. Yes.

Q. So when you went through the tunnel you had not got a
   clear intention to stay behind the goal? - A. No, no.

Q. Did you make your way left? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have any difficulty making your way left
   through the crowd in order to get to where you wanted
   to go? - A. For the first couple, six or seven feet,
   it was okay. We were going along the back wall and
   then we started to head down, there was a bit of a
   clearing, and then we just came to a standstill.

Q. Because you came to a large number of people? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The first so many feet you could go? - A. There were
   people there but you could move your way through,
   yes.

Q. Had you known that if you had gone to the back and
   there was a gate there, would you have done that? -
   A. Yes.

Q. But you did not know? - A. I didn't know.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. K I N G :

Q. You were asked, Mr. Grant, about what it was like
   before the big surge came and I want to ask about
   that. How long was it in terms of time between your
   entering through the tunnel trying to make your way
   left and your coming to this standstill? How long
   was that about in time? - A. About a couple of
   minutes.

Q. When you got there the big surge still had not
   occurred, had it? - A. No.

Q. You noticed the man in front of you at that stage? -
   A. Yes.

Q. At that stage before the big surge he was already
   doubled over, not there, and clearly not responding
   to you? - A. Yes, he was.

Q. So whatever had happened to him had happened to him
   before the big surge had come along? - A. Yes.

              Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Grant, you said at Wembley that you had to wait
   outside for twenty minutes is that right? - A. At
   Wembley?

Q. Yes, at the Wembley match?   - A. No, it was an hour
   and twenty minutes before,   from actually standing at
   the bottom of the steps to   actually entering the
   terraces it was roughly an   hour and twenty minutes.

Q. I thought you were delayed just getting into the
   match? - A. We were talking about crowds and that is
   just what sticks out in my mind.

Q. So you were not delayed outside at all? - A. At
   Hillsborough?

Q. No, at the Wembley match? - A. Yes, I was at the
   Wembley match.  This was the year before.

Q. Did you get in in time for kick-off at that match? -
   A. No, it was about twenty past three.

Q. That is what I have written down.  Did you enter the
   stadium at Wembley via a turnstile that day? - A.
   Yes.

Q. At that match you did not see any large concertina
   gates opening to speed things up at Wembley? - A. No,
   because at Wembley you go through normal turnstiles
   and then you are either at the bottom or you go
   upstairs and there is another gate there.

Q. So you would say the fans were admitted directly at
   Wembley? - A. I have still got my ticket.   They just
   let the turnstiles click round that day because when
   you get to these turnstiles, between the turnstiles
   there is like big crash bars and a lot of people were
   getting crushed on them.   I went through and a lot of
   other people went through.

Q. The only thing that happened to you that day was that
   you were delayed? - A. Yes.

Q. You were in no danger? - A. Not really, no.

Q. You came in 1989 to see the Semi Final I think? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. You came by car with a number of friends? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. What time did you leave, can you remember? - A. 9.30.

Q. What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. We took a
   wrong turning and ended up coming in at the
   Nottingham Forest end because we were stuck in a
   traffic jam the other side of Sheffield.  So we were
   pretty late.  I didn't park the car until about
   12.45.

Q. That was partly your fault for taking the wrong
   turning? - A. Yes.

Q. Annoying? - A. That is why I left early because I
   hadn't been there before.

Q. I think you actually know which road you parked in? -
   A. Yes, Dixon Road.

Q. Did you go straight to the ground from there? - A. We
   stopped and had a bit of lunch by the car first and
   then we walked slowly down to the ground.

Q. What time did you get to the ground? - A. About five
   to one, something like that.

Q. Quite early? - A. Quite early.

Q. Having got to the ground you approached the turnstile
   area, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you were met by some Police Officers outside
   the turnstile area and they had a go at you and
   searched you, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Then you went through the turnstiles? - A. And got
   searched again.

Q. Apart from the two searches you had no problems? - A.
   No.

Q. There was no difficulty about getting in? - A. No,
   not that early.

Q. You then went through the tunnel, did you? - A. I
   went to the toilet first and then I went straight
   through the tunnel.

Q. Were you intending to go behind the goal?   Was that
   where you were hoping to be? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember whether you went left or right? - A.
   I went left.

Q. So you went into Pen 4? - A. Yes.

Q. So this was just after one o'clock? - A. Yes, about
   ten past one.

Q. The pen was empty or full? - A. It was pretty empty,
   yes.

Q. No difficulty? - A. There was lots of room.    We had a
   choice where we wanted to stand.

Q. Where did you decide to decide? - A. I thought it was
   two barriers from the front but apparently it was
   only one because there was a barrier to the right, a
   single barrier on its own.

Q. We will get you to show us in a minute on the screen?
   - A. Yes, we were right in line with the six yards
   line.

Q. Having taken up your position that is where you
   remained throughout, is that right, more or less? -
   A. Until I got pushed somewhere else.

Q. Describe the build up, if you like, in the pen? - A.
   We were talking.   There was lots of room, as I say,
   and we were joking.   I was saying about the ground.
   I had never been here before and I said to my friend,
   "I thought you said it was a good ground.   I don't
   like this view" and just jokingly about this, that
   and the other.   It must have been about half past
   two, twenty past two, when it started to get a bit
   packed.  I suffer a little bit with claustrophobia
   anyway, not too much, but I don't like to be packed
   in.  It was about twenty to two when it really
   started getting - twenty to three, sorry.

Q. Twenty to three? - A. Yes, when it really started to
   get a bit distressing.   I was against the barrier at
   first.   I had the barrier in front of me and I was
   being crushed against the barrier and I just couldn't
   move at all.   I was pressed tight against the
   barrier.   So I had to sort of try and limbo myself
   down so that I could get underneath the barrier with
   the aid of my friends.   They pulled me under and as I
   went under I went face down on the floor and kicked
   in the side of the head.   I don't know who it was but
   a load of people just grabbed me and held me up and
   said, "Stay up, son.   If you go down you won't get
   back up again". When they lifted me up I was facing
   the opposite way to the pitch. My back was to the
   pitch.

Q. What I am interested in, so far as one is able to get
   timings for this, and it is difficult, did you look
   at your watch? - A. No, the only time I noticed the
   time was from the clock by the television gantry.

Q. Tell me what time it was when this happened to you? -
   A. It was round about twenty to three.

Q. That was when you were against the barrier you were
   saying? - A. Yes.

Q. Then I think you said you went underneath it, you
   fell, you were pulled down and you were facing the
   wrong way, how long did all that take? - A. It was a
   matter of minutes but when I faced the wrong way
   somebody had obviously taken my place at the bar from
   where I was standing.




                                        /Q. Yes.

Q. Yes. - A. He hit the bar with such force.   I mean, I
   didn't see that, but you could tell.   When I got up and
   was facing him, as soon as they lifted me up I was right
   facing him.   He was bent doubled over the bar.   We
   actually butted each other, he was that close to me.

Q. You, of course, weren't facing the pitch at that point? -
   A. No.

Q. Therefore you probably don't know what was happening on
   the pitch, would that be right? - A. No.

Q. Can you recollect whether the players had yet been
   announced?   Did you hear the players being announced? -
   A. I never saw a player.

Q. I am not asking whether you saw the players.   Whether
   you heard them being announced.   You know they usually
   announce players over the loudspeakers and people cheer.
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did you hear that at all? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you say whether the players had been announced after
   you were facing uphill, if I can put it like that, or
   before? - A. I think it was after.    I was facing the
   opposite way.

Q. After you were facing the opposite way? - A. Yes.

Q. You are saying you had been pushed, turned round, facing
   the wrong way and then you heard the players announced? -
   A. A few minutes later it was...

Q. I think things eased off a little bit then, did they? -
   A. Yes, they started to ease a little bit.    Not much,
   but they eased enough for me to try and get control of
   myself, but the man at the bar was still in distress and
   they were trying to push the man off the bar.    His
   ribs...   I don t know whether it was his ribs - it
   sounded like his ribs were cracking.    It could have been
   something in his coat pocket, but to me his ribs were
   breaking.

Q. But he didn't know, of course?   You heard some cracking
   sound? - A. Yes.

Q. Describe this chap.   What did he look like? - A. I would
   say he was about forty-ish.   To me, I would say he was a
   business man.   I don t know why I say that but he didn't
   seem the type to stand on the terraces.   He seemed the
   type to sit in the stands.   Not that you are type-cast.

                                               A.   W. LANGLEY


Q. Did he have a suit on? - A. No, he had like a casual
   jacket on, a sports jacket, beige or light brown.

Q. Did you call for people to ease back? - A. Yes.   Well,
   you were panic stricken.   You were just shouting
   anything to try and ease the situation.

Q. You were, of course, facing people? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you have the impression that anybody was paying any
   attention to you? - A. Well, I don't think...

Q. Apart from all the people who were helping this man? - A.
   To me it was self-survival.   You were there to help
   yourself.   There was nobody able to give you assistance
   even if they could get.   It was too tight.

Q. Could you see what was happening higher up in the
   terrace? - A. Yes, there were people being pulled up into
   the stands.   I mean, the man got to the point where he
   just slumped over the bar and then you had to start
   thinking you had to think of yourself.

Q. That is quite useful.   When did you see people being
   pulled up into the stands? - A. That was round about the
   time the man was being pushed.   You know, you have like
   a wide vision, you can see several things.   While you
   are doing something you can see several things going on.

Q. Can you remember the time interval?   Was it at the same
   time the man was being crushed up against this bar and
   people were being pulled up, or were people being pulled
   up after he had been crushed up against the bar? - A. It
   is a guess.   It would be after, you know, immediately
   after he was being crushed.

Q. Immediately after, do you mean immediately or five
   minutes after or one minute after? - A. No, I would say
   whilst he was being crushed against the bar people were
   being pulled up into the stands.

Q. You, of course, had been crushed against the bar before
   this? - A. Yes.

Q. You had managed to get underneath and turned round, so to
   speak? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you stay facing the wrong way the whole time? - A.
   No.   I had managed to turn myself round, but when I
   turned myself round there was a young lad in front of me
   with long hair.   With the perspiration his hair was
   stuck to my face.

                                                 A.   W. LANGLEY


Q. To your face? - A. To ray face when I turned round.   I
   touched the back of his head and his hair was all stuck
   to me because of the perspiration.    Once I had got my
   position, my scarf was so tight against the man it was
   pulling his arm.   My first objective was trying to get
   my hands up to loosen my scarf, to get my scarf off.

Q. What was happening on the pitch at that point? - A. I
   haven't got a clue.

Q. You are sure about that? - A. Positive.

Q. The players weren't on thepitch as far as...     I am not
   trying to put words into your mouth.   Iwant to make
   quite sure that you didn't    know what the playerswere
   doing? - A. They could have had four teams on and I
   wouldn't have had a clue.

Q. Now you were facing the right way, so to speak, but you
   could not see what was going on because you were... - A.
   The gentleman in front of me was taller than me, like.

Q. Did you see or hear anything e l s e ? - A. Well, as you can
   imagine, there was a lot of commotion going on and people
   were shouting and the next thing I saw was people trying
   to get over the perimeter fence.       There was a policeman
   in front.    Now the policeman resembled a neighbour.
   That is how I remember him.    He had a bald head and wore
   glasses.   I don't remember his number, but he resembled
   a neighbour.    Earlier on when we were in the ground I
   remember pointing him out to a friend and I said, "Look,
   there's my neighbour."    He resembled him very closely.
   The same officer at that time was pushing people back.
   He was using foul language, "Get back you animals" and so
   on.   He was really using foul language and he was
   hitting people's hands to get them off the fences.

Q. How close were you to him? - A. About as close as I am to
   that chair.

Q. I see, pretty close? - A. Yes.

Q. You said he was using foul language and he may well have
   been.   Could you actually hear it with your own ears? -
   A. Yes.

Q. It isn't that you lip read? - A. No, he was directly in
   front of me.

Q. So you could hear him? - A. Yes.

Q. You are saying he was pushing people back in? - A. Yes.
   He was shouting, "Get back. Get back you animals." and
                                                               23


                                                   A.   W.   LANGLEY


     pushing them back into the pen, but it was a lot stronger
     than that, of course.

Q.    Were you near the gate? -   A.    Thegate   was just over to my
     right.

Q.   Did you see it open or shut?- A.     Not at that point, no.

Q.    Did you notice it at that point? - A. I noticed where the
     gate was because once we had got where we were and we
     were trying to get out and we were shouting to the
     police, "Look, they are dead here. Get them out.     Help
     us get them out.*1  We were hysterical, totally
     hysterical.   Once we tried to do that my mate said,
     "Look, there is the gate, try to make your way over
     there."   I said, "I can t move.   There's nowhere for me
     to go."

Q. Does that mean the gate was open at that point? - A. No,
   the gate was shut.

Q. When did you see the gate open? - A. It was after three.
   It must have been about quarter past/twenty past three.
   I am not sure of the times on that.

Q. Be very careful with times because we know what time the
   gate was opened.    I don't want you to guess.   I am
   trying to relate the events that you are recounting to
   these things.    What I am trying to find out is, from
   you, when you saw people being pushed back in and the
   policeman swearing - 1 don't know what he was saying but
   whatever it was you didn't like it? - A. No.

Q. At that point was the gate open or shut? - A. To my
   recollection it was shut.

Q. OK.   This was happening after people were already being
   pulled up into the stands? - A. Yes.

Q. Just to clarify one point.   Was it just ones or were
   there lots of people being pulled up? - A. No, they were
   sort of spread out right along the back of the terraces
   and every so often...

Q. There were quite a lot? - A. Yes.

Q. This was in fact when you were still facing uphill, so to
   speak? - A. Yes.

Q. You said you then turned round, saw the policeman pushing
   people back, the gate was shut as far as you remember? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Did you actually see the gate open? - A. No.
                                            A.    W. LANGLEY


It was shut at one point and then it was open? - A. I saw
it open for a bit.   I saw it open and then probably the
next time I looked it was shut.   I didn't take much
notice.

Are you saying it was shut, it was open, it was shut
again? - A. No. What I am saying is I would look once
and it would be open.   Something would happen, you would
be pushed one way, you would be pushed another way.   You
would look again and the gate would be shut.

Then you are saying that you saw it opening and shutting?
You may not have seen the movement, but you saw... - A.
At one point the gate was open. At another point the
gate was shut.
Did you see it open after the second shutting? - A. No.

It stayed shut the whole time do you mean? - A. I don't
know.   I didn't take that much attention to the gate
because I was too busy fighting for my life at the time.
It was just something catches your eye, like.   My friend
said, "Make your way to the gate."   I would look at the
gate, the gate would be open, so you would try to squeeze
- it was impossible, you couldn't do it — but you would
try to squeeze your way towards the gate.   Then somebody
would push you that way and you would look again and the
gate was shut.   You know, that sort of...

In what relationship was this...   Can you relate the
time when you saw the gate open, before it was shut
again, in relation to the policeman swearing at you? - A.
No.

You can't relate it at all? - A. No.    As I say,
everything was happening so fast.    You were that busy
fighting to survive.   I just remember there were points
where I saw the gate open and I saw the gate shut.    I
don't remember any specific times or anything like that.

When you say you thought it was open at 3.15 - what made
you say that? - A. I don't know.   It seemed a bit later
on.   After the policeman was throwing people back, it
must have been later on.   Times are so confusing.

You don't know? - A. Because I did pass out for a short
time and there are bits I still don t remember.

Did you see an ambulance come on to the pitch? - A. Yes,
that was later on.

That was later on? - A. That was much later on.
                                                             25


                                                 A.   W.   LANGLEY


Q. In relation to the opening of the gate, how would you
   relate the opening of the gate to the ambulance? -A. As I
   say, times are difficult but I would imagine...

Q. If you can't do it, don't guess. - A. No, I couldn't
   guess.

Q. I don't want you to say things you can't say.      I just
   want you to say what you can.     Did you feel any surges?
   - A. Well, there were surges all the time.     You were
   being pushed one way and another. At one point we were
   pushed back.   This must have been after three o'clock.
   You were pushed forward.     You were pushed back.    People
   were making their way and trying to get out.     You were
   pushed in all   directions. As I was pushed back I
   stumbled.    I  stumbled onsomething and wondered what it
   was.   When I   looked down I had got one foot on a man's
   chin and another foot on a man's chest and people were
   shouting, "Get off him."     "Where can I go?^ There is
   nowhere for me to go."     I wasn't that polite either!
   There was nowhere for me to go but eventually the crowd,
   and the way it was going, you were pushed off him anyway.

Q. You describe in your statement one surge as if it had
   been a goal surge? - A. That is what it felt like.    When
   you stand on the Kop and they score you go forward and
   you come back, but this went forward and you didn't go
   back.




              Q. Did you hear any cheering
                                  A.W. LANGLEY



Did you hear any cheering behind you? - A. Oh yes, there
was plenty of cheering going on.

I am not talking about the people immediately around you
because you were shouting out for help. You have already
told me that.  I am trying to find out about the people
further back? - A. Yes, it sounded as if the people further
back had a lot more room than we had at the front because,
well as I say I don't remember the players ever being on
the pitch but obviously there was players on the pitch
because you could tell what was going on around you. They
were singing the players' names and obviously the people
at the back had a better view than what we had. Later on
I learnt I think it was Beardsley hit the bar and a big
cheer went up.

But you did not know that at the time?   - A.   No.

But you did hear a big cheer.    This is what   I am trying
to find out? - A. Yes.

Did it appear to you to be coming from the people further
back behind you? - A. Yes.

And then of course fortunately   you did get rescued yourself,
didn't you? - A. Sorry?

You got rescued yourself fortunately because otherwise
you would not be here? - A. Well what happened was I waited
till everybody had gone and it was about 5-past-4 when I
walked back through the tunnel.

Yes, you weren't pulled out but you managed to get out?
- a . Yes.

And you went out the back way did you? - A. Back through
the tunnel, yes.

Can we mark the plan. We will get you to show us where
you were with a cross please? - A. It was roughly about
there. That is where I ended up anyway.

Is that where you were when you heard the Policeman swearing?
- A. No, I think it was a bit further forward than that
because there was pushing going on.

I see, so you had moved a bit? - A. You were going forward
and then you would come back a little bit and then go
forward a bit more.

You could not identify where you were?   If you can't I
don't want you to guess. - A. I was a little closer than
that but that is roughly round about it.

                                       A.W. LANGLEY



          MR. BEECHEY:   343 sir.

Q.         THE CORONER: And the barrier against which you
     were pushed was the one immediately behind you, I take it,
     that is the one you ducked underneath? - A. Well the one
     to the left of the cross was why I thought there was two
     barriers.  I got pushed and that barrier was to my right.
     That is how I know where I was.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. I wonder if I might just try to follow up the sequence of
   events.  I appreciate it is not easy. What you have told
   the jury is that the time that you have given when it was
   distressing for you, the first time, was 20-minutes-to-3?
   - A. That is the time when it became really distressing,
   yes.  I was concerned a little earlier before that but not
   to the extent as I was by that time.

Q. At that time you were to start with behind the barrier?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Is it at that time that you went under the barrier? - A.
   Yes, well I was being crushed against the barrier so my
   immediate thought was:  "Get the other side of the barrier
   and put your back to the barrier and that way you can't
   be crushed against it".

Q. So is this the time when the incident happened that you
   were helped up? - A. Yes.

Q. And found yourself facing the chap who had taken your
   place? - A. Yes.

Q. The timing that you are putting on that is 20-to-3, is it?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Is that because that is when you looked at the clock? -
   A. Yes. You see when you go to the match every so often
   you look and you think:  "There is three-quarters-of-an-
   hour to go".  I always get in the game early anyway even
   at home matches, and you look at the clock and you think:
   "There is an hour to go before the game, there is half-an-
   hour to go" and I remember looking at the clock saying:
   "There is 30 minutes to go before kick-off" and that is why
   I was so sure, so it is roughly about ten minutes after
   that.

Q. So you are pretty sure, we have been over it again, sorry
   to repeat the same exercise, and you are still sticking
   on about 20-to-3? - A. About 20-to-3.

Q. For the incident of the ....     A. The fellow taking my
   place, yes.
                                                                 28


                                             A.W. LANGLEY



Q. Now what I want to just have a look at is you have described
   what happened to you at that time.  I want to have a look
   at the way in which the situation appeared from the outside,
   somebody looking into the pen at about the same time. Do
   you see? - A. Yes.

Q. The Coroner's Officer has very helpfully made an acetate
   of a particular photograph which I hope we can relate to
   your evidence so I wonder if that could be put up please?

              THE CORONER:     What is the reference?

           MR. PAYNE:        Sir, the reference is, it is one of these
     bundles.

              THE CORONER': The photograph should have a reference
     on it.     It is at the bottom there.

              MR. GRIFFITHS:     DB16/31.

           THE CORONER:        What number are we giving this,
     our reference.

              MR. BEECHEY:     344.

Q.         MR. PAYNE:  If you look at the bottom right-hand
     corner of this photograph, I am sorry it is difficult for
     you to turn round like that, but there is a timing which
     is printed on the photograph when it is taken, 15, and
     then if you follow it across you can see the time.  It is
     very difficult to make out but there is a '41 there, which
     is the minute, and it is 40-something.  It has been looked
     at and in the album we have here this is read as 46. Oh
     that is right, the time shown in fact is 45. If one looks
     at it very carefully. We have subsequently been told that
     the timing on this camera was one minute wrong so it ought
     to be 46, but however what we can actually see is it is
     40 something or other. Do you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. If you look in the top left-hand corner of this photograph
   you can see there is a sort of blue bar across the opening?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Now there is a character standing there in the middle bent
   doubled up underneath the Stand. Now he is standing, it
   appears to us on the fence which goes down between the
   two pens and then if you go a bit over to the right towards
   Mr. Griffiths, there is that chap standing there and he is
   obviously standing on one of those little walls that projects
   into the terrace, so what we are looking at there in the top
   corner is the entrance of the tunnel coming down into the
   terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. And the crowd of people in the foreground there are all in
   your pen which is Pen 4? - A. Yes.

                                       A.W. LANGLEY



Q. And this is just about - I appreciate that we can't be
   exact - but it is at about the time when you are having
   your incident of being lifted up from the ground at about
   20-to-3. Actually this is probably about five minutes
   later. Do you understand that? - A. Yes.

Q. Now from the point of view of anybody looking into the
   pen from the outside at that time that is more or less
   what they would have seen. Do you see that? -   A. Yes.

Q.    And we can more or less make out what your place would
     be as well lining it up from where the man is standing
     on the dividing fence we can see where that would go
     down off the left-hand side of the photograph and so
     the position you have marked, if Mr. Griffiths moves
     his pointer over a bit, it is sort of round about there
     is more or less the place you have marked your chart?
     - A. Yes, there or thereabouts. As I say it was a
     difficult situation.  You just did not know where you
     were and timings are difficult as well.

Q. Absolutely, I am only concerned really at the moment
   as to how the situation must have looked to somebody
   from outside the pen so we can fit your evidence on to
   that. Do you see? - A. Yes.

Q.   Now just following this up, if you look at the people
     down at the front there you can see that people are
     standing quite comfortably down near the perimeter fence.
     You can see the whole of their fronts some of them, do
     you see what I mean? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree it is fair to say it appears they are
   standing quite comfortably? - A. Yes.

Q. Now just about actually where you were in that area there
   are one or two people who in fact are facing backwards?
   - A. Yes.

Q. One of them might even be you possibly.  So that the crowd
   is obviously at that time more dense in one or two places
   than it is at others? - A. Yes.

Q. Okay, thank you very much for that exercise, I am grateful.
   One other point about how it seemed to other people.  You
   have given the description of how it affected you. We
   can get a little bit more from your evidence though about
   how it seemed to other people. At the time when it got
   really bad, after the time I have been asking you about
   and you were afraid for your life when you were being
   really crushed at the front, you could hear people at the
   back who were obviously cheering on the game? - A. Yes.

                                      A.W. LANGLEY



Q. So if we look at the picture there just to give ourselves
   an idea, I know this is not quite the right time, but those
   people who were cheering on the game would be somewhere
   towards the top of the crowd as we are looking at it there?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And they would be able to look out on to the field obviously
   but if they looked down the hill, down the slope, they would
   be able to see the part of the crowd in front. Of course
   there would be a lot of heads in the way but they would be
   able to see down across the top? - A. Yes.

Q. So despite the fact that you were in grave distress at the
   front it obviously can't have been apparent to the people
   at the back that you were in such grave distress otherwise
   presumably they would not have been cheering on the match?
   - A. I don't think they take personalities into effect when
   something is happening at the front. They are not going to
   take any notice from me at the back if they are watching
   the game. What I am trying to say is that me being in
   distress would not affect their attitude towards looking
   at the game.

Q. Even if they had known you were in distress you mean? - A.
   I should not think so.  I was that far forward they could
   not have done anything anyway.  I see the point that you
   are making, obviously it is difficult with the times.

Q. I am not criticising you, it is quite helpful? - A. I see
   the points Mr. Popper was making about being certain about
   times.

Q. Quite, I understand that. Do you want to change anything
   in your evidence then? I am not asking you to but if you
   want to? - A. The only thing I would change is the times.
   It was difficult.  It was really difficult. You are in a
   situation where you are literally fighting for your life
   and you try to remember times and it just does not happen
   that way.  It is difficult.

         MR. PAYNE:   Thank you very much.

         THE CORONER: Nobody is criticising you for that.
   Don't worry about that, Mr. Langley.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Langley, it is only because Mr. Payne has put this
   photograph up and while we have been looking at it I ask
   you any question at all. Can we actually see you.   It
   may be it isn't you .... A. I thought it was.

Q. Is that you?   Sergeant Griffiths, could you just put the
                                                            31

  pointer up. Between the two. Move to your right now.
  Stop there. Was that you? - A. No sir. Can I point out
  which one I thought was me?

Q. Yes, of course. It is just that looks very similar to
   you. You thought that might be you? - A. Yes.

         MR. ISAACS:    Very well.    Yes, thank you very much
   indeed.

        THE CORONER: That is a very good demonstration
  how difficult it is to do identifications, isn't it?

         MR. ISAACS:    It is indeed sir.

        MR. MANNING:     We have not actually got one right
  up to now.

         THE CORONER: We had one. We got a mounted Officer
   I think right.   Mr. Manning, were you going to ask anything?

        MR. MANNING:  It is just if the witness is right he
  is miles away from where he thought he was on the plan as
  well.  If you want to put that acetate up again if that
  is where he thinks he was, that is him.

          THE WITNESS: As I say a few feet in a small space
   like that can seem more yards than feet.  I have been back
   to the ground five times and tried to stand where I actually
   stood.   It is very difficult. It is in such a small space.

         THE CORONER:    I think we have to just accept it.

         MR. MANNING:   Absolutely.

        THE CORONER: Of course in the transcript you won't
  know which head he has picked out. Is it necessary? Do
  we need that? Can you put a little cross above his identi­
  fication on the acetate? I am not holding you to this
  identification don't worry.

        THE WITNESS:  I have been to the Hillsborough Centre
  in Liverpool with Social Services and tried to identify

          THE CORONER:   Can you put it in the notes,
     possible identification on C344, marked with a cross,
     but very doubtful. Mr. King, thank you for being
     patient.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Mr. Langley, don't concern yourself with times for a
   moment, because there is an obvious danger that
   photograph may have been before you had your
   experience, it may have been after, because you
   weren't, as you say, having a stop-watch, were you? -
   A. No.

Q. I want to deal with your factual experience and to put
   it in some context. Whatever time it was when you were
   first in considerable distress, crushed over that
   barrier, it was before 3 o'clock, would that be fair? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Clearly the game had not started at that stage? - A.
   No.

Q.   Whatever time it was?   - A. Whatever time.

Q.    When you were on the floor being picked up and in
     difficulties, what was it like immediately around you?
     Put it in words how tight it was? - A. It was very
     tight. People were falling, it was really tight. The
     only way I have described it is that we felt like
     candles. All you could move was your head, that is all
     you could move. Your body was like wax, they had all
     melted together. You just could not move your body.

Q. This was at the stage, was it, when you had been pulled
   up off the ground and you were facing the wrong way? -
   A. Well, it wasn't exactly at that stage but it was
   tight.

Q. I want to take it in stages. When you were pulled up
   and you were facing the wrong way, all right? - A. Yes.

Q. How tight was it then? - A. It was tight but it wasn't
   packed as I have just described.

Q. Then you were turned round and you obviously were so
   tight that you could touch the man in front? - A. Yes.
   I wasn't actually turned round. When I was picked up I
   was picked up the opposite way round if you see what I
   mean.

Q. Yes, then you managed to turn yourself round? - A. Then
   I managed to squeeze myself between them and face the
   other way.
                                                             33

                                               A.   W.   LANGLEY




Q. Clearly you were so close to the man in front that you
   were able to touch his hair because you described it
   stuck to you? - A. Well his hair was touching me, yes.

Q. So how tight was it then? - A. It was tight, very
   tight.

Q. When was the stage reached when you have described, I
   think you said it was like candles, did you say? - A.
   Yes.

Q. How long was it after you had first gone on the floor,
   can I put it that way? - A. A good 20 minutes, half an
   hour.

          THE CORONER:  I am sorry, I was not
     concentrating. Just repeat your question - I have
     heard his answer.

          MR. KING:   My question was, sir, how long was it
     after he first went on the floor that it became so
     tight they were like candles.

         THE CORONER:   Thank you.

Q«        MR. KING:   At that stage were people shouting for
     the Police to open the gates .... - A. They were
     shouting for anybody. They were just shouting for
     help, full-stop.

Q. You gave evidence of people trying to climb out and
   being pushed back? - A. Yes.

Q. At that stage had you reached the stage when you were
   like candles in the way you have described? - A. No, it
   wasn't that bad. It was tight.

Q. How bad was it when people were trying to climb out.
   It was bad, it was very tight, but it is difficult.  It
   was tight but you had a bit of movement, you could use
   a bit of movement.

Q. Were the people around you in distress? - A. They were
   clearly in distress, yes.

Q. Why do you say they were clearly in distress? - A.
   Well, what made the matter worse was when people were
   falling, people were moving out of the way so they
   didn't stand on them, and certain sections of the pen
   would end up tighter than other sections of the pen, if
   you understand what I mean, because people would make
   room to let other people try and pick up that person.
                                                               34

                                                 A.   W.   LANGLEY




Q. So we have a picture of people falling on the ground? -
   A. No, people have actually gone down - describing it
   is difficult because you don t exactly fall. People
   have gone down on the floor ....

Q. What has caused them to go down on the floor? - A.
   Well, they have probably fainted or lost consciousness
   or whatever, something like that, or they have died or
   whatever, and they have gone on the floor and people
   have tried to make space to pick them people up, so as
   not to stand on them, therefore the people that have
   moved out of the way are pushing other people to one
   side.

Q. Can you relate when that was happening to your seeing
   Police Officers pushing people back into the pen? - A.
   No, I can't relate to it. It all happened so fast,
   everything was happening - it is difficult.

                Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN

Q.   It is Mr. Langley, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q.   You say you usually like to stand behind the goal when
     you go to matches? - A. No, not right directly behind
     the goal but just to the left of the goal, like the six
     yard line.

Q. How far away from the centre of the goal do you         like to
   be? - A. It would be about three yards.

Q.    Quite close then really, isn't it? - A. Quite close,
     yes. You would describe it as being behind the goal.

Q. So you would prefer to go in at either Pen 3 or 4? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Yet you say that you suffer a bit from claustrophobia?
   - A. Yes, but I don't mean that in the sense that I
   can't go to crowds or anything like that. I mean if it
   gets too packed I need space. I like to feel air. It
   is not medical or anything like that, it is just the
   way I feel with crowds.

Q.    Not comfortable to you. You do know that the most
     crowded part of the terrace is behind the goal, don't
     you? - A. No, not particularly because I had not been
     to that ground before so I did not know the format of
     the ground. I would have imagined it to have been like
     the Kop at Anfield, wide open, not penned off.

Q.    Are you an experienced football supporter? - A. Well I
     go to every Liverpool game at home, yes.
                                                               35

                                                 A.   W.   LANGLEY




Q. I have heard other supporters say that the most popular
   spot on the terrace is immediately behind the goal? -
   A. Well it would be for some supporters, but I mean,
   like the Kop at Anfield, you can’t get 16,000 people
   behind the goal.

Q. I am   just saying it is a more popular spot though? - A.
   Yes,   to some people it is a popular spot, yes.

Q. I hope I have got this right, you said that you found
   it quite crowded at 20-past-2? - A. Not quite crowded.
   It was starting to fill up.

Q. You did mention 20-past-2, didn't you? - A. Yes.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Dr. Popper is looking ....

        THE CORONER:   I don't remember him mentioning 20-
   past-2 but if he says he did, he did. Carry on, Mrs.
   McBrien.                                   7   *

        MR. KING:   Sir, he said at about 20-past-2, 2.30,
   it started to get a bit packed.

          THE CORONER:    I am sorry, I had forgotten that.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Thank you, Mr. King.
Q. You found it crowded at 20-past-2, but    many fans in
   there who were used to standing behind    the goal would
   not find it particularly uncomfortable    then, would
   they? - A. Well I can't speak for what    other fans
   think.

Q. No, that is true, but because you say you get a bit
   claustrophobic it may feel different for you than it
   would for others, I am sure? - A. Yes.

Q. So at that time did you think about moving from the
   centre part to an outer area? - A. At what time.

Q. Say 2.20, 2.30? - A. I would have done but being so
   close to the kick-off it wasn't worth it. I may as
   well have stayed where I was and just made the best of
   a bad thing, you know.

Q. Yes, even though you still had half an hour to move? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You decided to stay there? - A. I decided to stay, yes.

Q. Though it may get more crowded? - A. Well I don't know
   whether it would get crowded or not.
                                            A.   W.   LANGLEY




No, I don't mean to the extent it did but obviously it
would get more crowded than it was at half-past-2 in
any case, I would think? - A. Yes.

You were on the terrace quite a long time, weren't you?
What time did you get on the terrace, please? - A. I
got on the terrace about 5-past, 10-past-l.

And you did not leave it until 5-past-A? - A. Well the
only way I am certain about that time is I was still on
the terrace when the manager, Mr. Dalgleish, came down
from giving his message from the Police Control Box,
and that is why I am so certain about the time. That
was given at about 5-past-A.

Why did it take you so long to get away from the pens?
- A. For a start off I couldn't make my way to any
gate. It was so packed you couldn't move.

In the beginning, yes. - A. At the beginning, and later
on I was just, I don't know - my friend described me
that I was just in a state of shock. I didn't know
what world I was on, what planet I was on or anything.
I didn't have a clue, so I was in his hands and he
decided to wait until most of them had been taken away
or gone and then take me off the terrace. Two
Policemen escorted me off the terrace actually.

So you were just in a daze and you stayed there a very
long time? - A. Well, I don't remember anything about
it, coming off the terrace, I just remember that it was
pretty late.

Thank you very much.

          Cross-Examined by MISS ADDLEMAN

Mr. Langley, you have been helpfully shown a photograph
which was clearly taken from an angle outside the pen
at 2.A6. Am I correct in thinking that you don't
relate that photograph to what you were actually seeing
around you? - A. Obviously after seeing that photograph
I wasn't there, but if that was 2.A5 then I was
somewhere else obviously, because that was not where I
was standing at 2.A5.

But the picture shows a general view of Pen A and
clearly you were in Pen A? - A. Yes, I was clearly in
Pen A.

So you were somewhere in there but we just can't pick
you out? - A. No.
                                                              37

                                               A.   W. LANGLEY




Q. The point is, Mr. Langley, that you can only really
   speak about what was happening in your immediate
   vicinity? - A. Yes.

Q. A couple of people either way all around you? - A. Yes.

Q.   And beyond that you don't really know how it appeared
     to someone looking inside the pen? - A. No. The
     problem I had was, my friend is 6 foot A, and the
     people around me were all tall and I was trying to
     jostle for a good spec, and it is difficult.

Q.   So you are just talking about your experiences as   it
     appeared just around you? - A. Yes.

Q. Again am I correct in thinking that really so far as
   timing is concerned you are really only hazarding
   guesses? - A. Yes.

Q. Other than the time you pinpointed at 2.AO? - A. Yes,
   more or less. I have totally thrown times out of the
   window now.

Q. You mentioned to the Court there came a time when
   Policemen were shouting, "Get back, get back", and
   pretty forcefully I gather? - A. Yes.

Q. Did I gather from, I think it was your last reply to my
   learned friend Mr. King, that you really can't relate
   that to any specific time or incident? - A. The only
   thing I can relate it to was, I don't know about time.
   As I say, I am just totally confused with time now,
   totally confused, but the only thing I can relate it
   with is there was a photographer who came right up to
   the fence and was taking pictures. That made the crowd
   angry, it made the crowd very angry, and everyone was
   shouting abuse at this man. Then it was, sort of,
   people were trying to climb over the fence and this man
   is between supporters climbing over the fence, taking
   pictures, and that is the only thing I can relate it
   with.

Q. And the Policeman said something at round about that
   time? - A. It was round about that time, yes.

Q. You have clearly mentioned that the crowd were incensed
   at this point? - A. Not at the Policeman.

Q. Not, but they were incensed and they were showing their
   displeasure? - A. Yes.

Q. You have mentioned abuse. Clearly was there a lot of
   swearing therefore going on at that point? - A. By
   supporters?

                                              A.   W. LANGLEY




Q. Yes. - A. I don't know if you have been to a football
   match, but it always goes on. Yes, there was. People
   were actually swearing at the Policemen, "Get us out of
   here, there's people dead". We were shouting, "Look,
   we're fighting for our life, we can't breathe, get us
   out", but a lot stronger than that.

Q. A great deal of commotion, a great deal of
   understandable blue language.  Clearly you do not
   know what was going on in the Policeman's mind, that
   is obvious? - A. That is obvious, yes.

Q. Therefore, when he was saying, "Get back, get back"
   very forcefully, again you do not know what was in
   his mind when he was saying that? - A. No.

Q. Tell me this, Hr. Langley, did you see gestures or
   gesticulations from any Policeman on the perimeter
   track in this motion, pushing forward with hands,
   this sort of thing? - A. There are Policemen
   shouting, "Push back, get back.  Tell those at the
   back to move back" and things like that but it was
   impossible to move.  You could not go anywhere.   I
   mean even if somebody actually told you what to do
   you could not do it.  It was impossible.

                  Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. You have done very well actually.  It is exceedingly
   difficult.  I just want to try once more to pick up
   one point if I may.  You have told us that you had
   been pushed against the barrier.  You had come
   underneath.  You had been pulled up. They pulled you
   up and put you the wrong way round so to speak? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You were then facing this jammed man? - A. The
   gentleman.

Q. He was being crushed against the barrier, right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You and your friends were trying to push him off
   it? - A. Yes, by the shoulders.

Q. So that he would not get hurt? - A. Yes.

Q. Forget all about the time. Let us forget all about
   that.  I did ask you, and I just want to check that
   this is correct, whether this was happening at the
   same time as spectators were being pulled up into the
   stands above? - A. Yes.

Q. You were looking that way, you see, and so it is
   possible and what I want to try and ascertain is
   whether you are confident that those two things were
   happening at the same time? - A. Thinking about it
   now, looking at the gentleman in the pictures who was
   standing on the wall, I mean it is going to sound
   silly.  I may have been mistaken that those fellows
   were being pulled up into the stands because it was a
   distressing situation. A situation can look
   different from two angles if you know what I mean.

                                                  A . T.: TAKnr.KY




Q. The point is that we know people were being pulled up
   into the stands? - A. Yes.

Q. We know that and we have plenty of videos to show us
   that. What I am trying to find out is whether you
   actually saw them being pulled up into the stand
   because we can then may be reconstruct it from that.
   Do you understand? - A. Yes.

Q. Forget about the times on the photographs and all
   that stuff because you may be wrong with your
   timings, I do not know.  The Jury will make up their
   minds about that.  If we can relate it to an event
   then that helps, do you understand? - A. Yes.

Q. Let us just try again.  Did you see supporters being
   pulled up into the stand? - A. Yes.

Q. You definitely saw it? - A. Yes, I definitely saw it.

Q. You definitely saw it and there is no question about
   it? - A. No.

Q. Did you see them when you were facing the wrong way,
   away from the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not see it after you had turned round and
   were looking towards the pitch, whatever happened
   after that? - A. No.  I was the opposite way and so I
   couldn't see.

Q. So it must have been when you were looking up? - A.
   Yes.

Q. That is the point in time when the gentleman was
   having difficulties against the crash barrier? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Can I ask another question and this is not a
   criticism of you? You might take it as that but it
   is not intended.   You turned round because you told
   me that? - A. Yes.

Q. So presumably you stopped pushing the chap off the
   barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. Why did you do that? - A. The man had sort of fell
   across.  He just fell down across the barrier and
   people were being passed over our heads and I
   remember one, I don't know whether it was the same
   time or not, there were other things going on about
   and my scarf had been twisted about and so with
   dealing with the man like that I was trying to turn
   round and my scarf got stuck but the reason I stopped
   helping the man was because he had bent double over
                                                              41

     the bar.  So I thought you have got to look after
     yourself.

Q. It is not intended as a criticism.  I was just
   wanting to find out what had happened and you have
   explained it to me.

     MR. KING: A very fair point has been pointed out to
me, sir.  In case the witness relies on the photograph too
much to change his view.

       THE CORONER:   I do not want him to do that.

     MR. KING: Of course not, but it has been pointed out
to me that that only shows Pen 4 and it does not show Pen 3
and we do not know what may or may not have been happening
in terms of the people clambering up or otherwise on that
photograph because we cannot see.

       THE CORONER:   I am not basing m y . ...

     MR. KING:  I know you are not, sir, but I am saying
that to point out the dangers of anybody saying that
"Because that photograph shows X or Y I must be right or
wrong".

Q.        THE CORONER:   You have understood what Mr. King
     has said? - A. Yes.

Q. We want you to tell us as best as you can the truth
   as you know it and that I think you have done. - A.
   Yes.

Q. I think you said you had taken up your position
   exactly in line with the six yards line? - A. That is
   where I always intend to go but with having four
   mates sometimes you are in line and sometimes you are
   either side, you know.

Q. It may enable to line that up if we think it
   necessary? - A. Yes.

Q. Not now because we need to do a bit of research.
   Thank you very much indeed. - A. Thank you very
   much.

     THE CORONER:   We must have a break now.     We will
adjourn now for fifteen minutes.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   There is one matter I would briefly
raise with you in the absence of the Jury.

     THE CORONER:   Why not leave us, ladies and gentlemen,
and we will carry on? I will say quarter of an hour but it
might be a bit longer.
                                                         42



                (The Jury retired from Court!

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   The reason I rise now is that there
was a plea for me to stand before four o'clock in order to
give you, sir, a chance to hear it.  It is not an
application as such but a word from all of us to try and
help you.  I understand my learned friend, Mr. King, wishes
to take instructions and perhaps we could rise for about
five minutes just to express our thoughts to you as to how
we may be able to assist.

     THE CORONER:    Is this to do w i t h ___

    MR. CATCHPOLE:    It is on the point of how we can
assist you.

     THE CORONER:   Shall we have our coffee for ten
minutes or so and then come back.  Do whatever we need to
do and then call the Jury back but we do need a break.

                     (Short Adjournment!

      MR. CATCHPOLE:   I only rise because you may have
divined an anxiety, certainly on this side of the bench, to
give as much assistance to you in trying to make this
Inquest as comprehensive as possible in the shortest
reasonable time.  One of the matters we have been talking
about between ourselves is that it did seem to us that we
may be able to assist you if we could see some of the
statements from supporters and Police Officers of junior
ranks that you may be considering calling and then we could
all sit down together and see whether having reviewed all
the statements we could reach a unanimous approach to it.
If there are, at least in our minds, any witnesses who do
not add anything from our point of view - and we are very
conscious, of course, that we do not represent the whole
spectrum and in particular we do not represent public
interests and we are not representing anyone not
represented by Mr. King.

     THE CORONER:    Yes.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   From our point of view we would wish
to see if we could be of some assistance to you by saying
so far as we are concerned we do not think there is much
that we would want out of these witnesses and it is really
along those lines that we are thinking. We are feeling a
bit neutered, if that is the right way of putting it,
because we cannot assist you and we feel we could be of
more assistance.

     THE CORONER:    It is very kind of you and I appreciate
it.  I woke up this morning and I was rather tired and
perhaps jaundiced as well - not I hasten to add because I
had been drinking - and I was thinking that in the middle
of next week I was going to try and do a cull if that is
the right word.   I was going to do it this weekend to
select out the people who I think I do not need. We have
                                                        43


heard a great deal of evidence, more‘perhaps than one
appreciates when one just thinks about it, but a great deal
has already been said.  I was then going to list for you
the people who I thought would be useful to exclude and it
may well be I can give you more information then.

     It is a big job I can tell you.   I have got ten or
twelve files with copy statements in which we are talking
about and so it is not a five minute exercise.  Certainly
there has to be a limit.  I said it did not matter to me
how long we sat but, of course, it does matter to the Jury
and in the end if we exhaust them then we achieve nothing.
We have to make it comprehensive but comprehensible as
well.

     MR. CATCHPOLEs   I think I speak for everyone, sitting
down over the weekend as far as possible going through as
many statements - if we could just sit down at some stage
and say that we have a list of people we do not ..think we
need to call, between the lawyers themselves....

     THE CORONER:   I am sorry, I am finding it difficult
to hear you.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Perhaps we could see the list and see
the statements over a weekend, sir, that would give us
sufficient time to come back on Monday morning. We could
meet early, have a brief meeting, and it may impinge
slightly into the day but there would be a saving in the
long term which will be much greater.

     THE CORONER:    If things are going to go according to
plan then we will have Superintendent Marshall tomorrow and
perhaps Friday, I do not know.    I have allowed for that.
Next week I want to take a batch of supporters and these
are all supporters I feel I definitely want to take because
they are connected in many cases with individual deceased
and I have selected, if I can put it like that, on the
basis that although it is a generic part we want to get a
good and complete   picture. We want to get people who have
something to say.     I think the chances are that most of
next week there will be witnesses who I could leave out but
I think would be wrong to leave out.    I think it is in the
interests of everybody that that batch of supporters, if
you like, has the opportunity to tell me, and particularly
the Jury, what they want. After that there are loads of
people on my provisional list who I think we will with
profit be able to leave out.    If I let you have that at the
weekend, I know it is a lot of work, but it might save
quite a bit of time in the long run. What do you say to
that, Mr. King?

     MR. KING: Sir, I am also part of the submission which
is being made and   I agree with it as an attempt to try and
bring things together in a reasonably short time.   One
other alternative, of course, is that if one saw a witness
statement of somebody and someone says, "That is important"
and we all agree it in the sense that we do not challenge
it then one could just read it.    That is another way of
approaching it.

     THE   CORONER:   Yes, that is also a possibility.

     MR. HALE:   Ancillary to that, sir, I have had a word
with one or two of m y learned friends but not all on the
question of the extract which may have been mentioned to
you over the interval of the findings of Dr. Forrest and I
have now cleared up with the assistance of your Officer a
small discrepancy.   I now have an accurate extract from it.
I would like to circulate it to m y learned friends and see
whether they would accept that it is an extract in a way
which is purely factual without any comment whatever.   They
are the findings of Dr. Forrest and if possibly one of your
Officers might be just able to say he has looked at it and
just put it in as an agreed document that might save a lot
of twisting and turning amongst the evidence.




                                  /THE CORONER
                                                        45




     THE CORONER:    If your colleagues are willing to
agree it, then when you have agreed it, shall we say, let
me have it.   Until that happens, of course, it mustn't
be put to the jury under any circumstances, which I am
sure you will agree.

     I don't know, I haven't seen the document myself.
I can't say.    I don't want to see it because this is a
matter for you.

     MR. HALE:   All it is is because in Dr. Forrest's
evidence the names come haphazardly with the amount at
the side of them, the computer has the ability to take
all that information and then put it in alphabetical
order and then also put it in order of content.   It is
merely factual but expressed in a way that is more easy
to see and understand.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I have no objection to that.

     Can I just say a couple of other things vhile we are
here, on the topic we were discussing last night, the
PACE statements.   I think we will have them.   I
understood what you said and I think that is the right
way of doing it.

     There are two things about it I want to say.    I did
indicate to you particularly, Mr. Manning, that I thought
in principle one could cut the PACE statements and I have
done it, but I didn't think it was likely it would be
possible to do it in these particular Inquests.    I have
been thinking about that and it may well be that there
are some of the statements which move into areas which
are totally outside the bounds of my Inquests.    If it is
interspersed, if there are a couple of questions inthe
middle of it, then it is impossible to cut thoseout and
I wouldn't want to do it because we would be spending all
our time switching the machine on and off.   However, if
it is a complete section - let us imagine there is a
complete section on something which is totally...    Then
I don't see any reason why, if I think it is quite
outside our scope, for me to cut it.

     I just wanted to say that because I might have given
you the impression that that could not, or would not,
happen.   I think it is highly unlikely with our first
witness, because Superintendent Marshall was, to all
intents and purposes, outside, and I think all of that is
relevant.

     The second thing is that when you hear them, in fact
a number of them may have seen them.   As you know, you
are entitled to receive copies of the tapes and you may
well have heard them. I think in some cases there are
                                                          46




references to recollections.   There are references to
Lord Justice Taylor's transcripts and various things of
that sort.   Now if we listen to the PACE statements, if
we read the statements, if we then read the transcripts
of Lord Justice Taylor s evidence, not only will we have
heard the evidence three times, but we will be here not
for one...   Do you see what I mean? Some of the
witnesses were before Lord Justice Taylor for a day and
half and it would take just as long to read it, audibly,
that is, so that the jury can understand, as for the
witness to say it.

     I think I will exercise my judgment as to how much
of the documentary references we will hear, if I can put
it like that.   In particular I think it is highly
unlikely that I will want to read the Whole of the LJT
transcripts, even if the witness says, "I accept it and
agree that it is entirely true."   The chances are that
if that is so when we ask him questions, if there is
anything which arises out of those transcripts Which has
not been covered in the PACE statement, it can be put to
that witness and it saves us an enormous amount of time
in reading words which don't advance either our
knowledge, or, more particularly, the Inquests.

     Is   that reasonably clear?   It     will vary,I think,
what we   read and What we don't read     on the - Iwas going
to use the word "quality" - that is not meant as a
criticism, but on the quality of the interview.     It may
well be   that the interview will have elicited everything
that we need to know from the point       of view ofthe
Inquests.    There is hardly any point in hearing it again
put in a different format.

     MR. MANNING:   Thinking time is needed,   I think.

     THE CORONER:  Yes, we can talk about it this
afternoon.   I am not expecting a response.

     MR. MANNING:    The initial response to what you say
about the editing is that I think it is a two-way
process, one for dialogue, if I may put it that way.
Obviously the conduct of these Inquests is entirely in
your hands. He all know that and accept that.     Equally,
it would be helpful to me in giving advice generally to
my client, and I refer to my client specifically, if I
were to know at some stage when you had completed what
you thought was the necessary editing of the statement.

     THE CORONER:   Briefly what I am saying is that if
we take our cut-off point at 3.15, roughly.   He have
gone over this already what I mean by that.    If the
witness starts talking about What happened in the
Directors' Lounge at 3.30 or round the corner in the
                                                     47




gymnasium at four o'clock, then I will say we don't need
that.   It is very interesting but we don t need it for
these Inquests.
     If I let it go through - I mean, we could just let
it play, of course, and have done with it, but we have
introduced it and as soon as we introduce it people will
want to ask questions on it.   I am quite satisfied in my
mind that things like that are outside the scope of these
Inquests, interesting though they be.   That is really
what I have in mind.
     It may turn out, because I can't remember exactly
how the statements are constructed, it depends how the
PACE statement was built up.   If it was built up
higgledy-piggledy we will not be able to do it.   If it
is built up in nice sections it won't be too difficult.

     I am merely saying it because I may have given you
the impression yesterday that I would not do it in these
Inquests, but I might.
     MR. KING:   Can I just ask two procedural questions
arising out of what you have indicated?   First of all,
is the procedure to be followed, therefore, that when a
witness comes into the witness box who falls into these
categories, that before he gives any evidence to you,
sir, we will first hear the PACE statement?   Is that the
procedure?

     THE CORONER:   That is what I want to do.

     MR. KING:   The second point is this, sir.   I
assume that the PACE statement, the audio statement, has
been reduced to writing?
     THE CORONER:   I think that is right, it has.

     MR. KING:   I don't know whether it is possible to
circulate in advance a copy of that to the legal
representatives of those parties who are not the
representative of that individual, because it will save
an awful lot of time in terms of making notes and so
forth, as he is giving his evidence, and one can think
far more easily about what your questions are going to
be.
     HIE CORONER:   I don't know whether we can do it
because they run into 150/200 pages.   You are going to
hear it all so it is not as if there is anything secret.
Unfortunately we will probably be transcribing it all
into the transcript, so to speak, and the shorthand
writer will be supplying a copy.
                                                       48




     I don't think it will be possible to do it for all.
Would legal representatives take very strong objection if
we found one extra copy and let Mr. King have it, because
in a sense Mr. King is the one who needs it most
urgently?

     MR. PAYNE:    Sir, my immediate response to that is
that one can certainly see it would be helpful to have
statements in advance, but if this were to be done in
respect of some particular witnesses, then it would
certainly be helpful to us if it were done for others.
For example, some of those who have given evidence over
the last two days.    Your Officers were extremely helpful
in getting out that photograph at very short notice.     If
we had had the statement earlier then perhaps we might
have been able to prepare it a little bit earlier.    I am
not criticising at all.    I am very grateful for the help
we were given, but I am a little bit concerned...

     THE CORONERS   This is the difficulty, you see.   I
have got such problems keeping my head above water, if I
can put it like that.

     MR. KING:   There is a distinction, if I may say so,
between the sort of statements my learned friend is
talking about which, of course, are not statements which
of themselves are the evidence, which are simply for you,
sir, and ourselves to have in front of us while the
witness gives his evidence orally, and the PACE
statements which are in themselves to become part of the
evidence in their entirety.

     THE CORONER:   I think Mr. Payne, if I were to say
to Mr. King that when we switch the video or the audio
tape on I will let Mr. King at that point have the typed
version to save him writing - the chances are that some
of these you may already be aware, I don't know, or if
you are not I don't mind your having a copy as well,
provided we can rake up two copies.   However, I don't
think we can rake up copies for everybody.   It is not
possible.

     MR. PAYNE:     Sir, others may wish to make separate
submissions.    My response is really that if this were to
be done there ought to be parity between all sides, so
that if witnesses* statements are to be provided to one
party, as it were, in the sense...

      THE CORONER:   Mr. King is making the point that
isn't...    It is a witness statement in the sense that
technically the PACE statement is being given by the
Officer who took it, and that is why we had them on the
19th.    We tried to short circuit, if you like, officer
time, West Midland Officer time, so in that sense you are
                                                     49




quite right, the PACE statement is a witness statement.
However, it is not one on which the cross-examination, if
I can put it like this, will not be directed at the
officer who is presenting it but at the deponent who is
being interviewed, the interviewee.

     I want to be helpful.   I just don't want to
duplicate 10,000 sheets of paper, particularly when next
morning we will have them.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, for my part I have not asked you
to do that in relation to witnesses, some of whom play an
important part in what actually happened.   For example,
some of the witnesseswho have given evidence recently
about their behaviour in the pens.  I am thinking
particularly about the one who fell forward on to the
crowd in advance.   I am not asking to be provided with
statements of witnesses like that, sir.

     THE CORONER:   I don't want to do that.

     MR. PAYNE:   That is what I an saying.   If it is to
be done in one category then it ought to be done in all
categories.   That is the only reservation I have got
about it.
     THE CORONER:   Can I think about that?    On the
other hand, Mr. King, it is probably right to say that I
think you are one of the parties who do receive the daily
transcript, your instructing solicitors do.    It seems an
awful waste to re-type it, but I think we want to get it
in all the same format and have it correctly done.    In
that sense you will know it will be there the next
morning, barring accidents.

     MR. KING:   One doesn't know the time gap between
hearing evidence and when one is asking questions.     The
point I make is a very simple one, sir.    It is not the
same sort of evidence we are dealing with.    This is
evidence which we know is going to be given in the way
you describe it, word for work.   All I am seeking is a
little help while it is being given.    It has a different
quality from the statements which my learned friend is
referring to.

     THE CORONER:   I do understand what you are saying,
Mr. King.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, with respect, that does apply
to everyone.   I would not have heard, for example, any
of the senior officers' tapes, so I would be in the same
position as Mr. King if I wanted to cross-examine then.
Equally, with one's own witnesses, if one is going to re-
                                                     50




examine them, one wants to know exactly what they have
said.

     If Mr. King is going to have - I am not complaining
about his application, I think it is very sensible - but
if Mr. King is going to have the exact words in front of
him in the form of a typed sheet, it would be very
helpful to me, sir, in the event I want to ask questions
of witnesses to be able to say, "You did actually say..."
in the context, "...exactly this."    Mr. King is saying,
"Shame!"

     THE CORONER:   In a sense what you aretrying to do
is you are wanting to be able to follow and you don't
want to spend eight hours writing it laboriously down in
writing.   Yes, Mr. Isaacs?

     MR. ISAACS:   This is exactly the point, sir, if I
may say so.   I think I would say this on benalf of us
all.   We all agree with what my learned friend Mr. King
has said. There are two reasons for asking for prior
disclosure of these interviews.   The first is to save
our hands and, indeed, it is very difficult to write down
as it comes what is being said, particularly if it is an
interview between policeman and interviewee.   The second
reason is, as my learned friend has said, to perhaps give
one foreknowledge of what is to be said so one can
consider what questions are to be asked.   Therefore
there is a degree of saving of time perhaps by my learned
friend Mr. King and others, so that they don't have to
say to you, "Now we have heard all this for the first
time, sir, could we have a bit of time to consider it?"

     However, and this is the point, sir, with respect,
if it applies to Mr. King, then it applies to
Mr. Catchpole, it applies to me and it applies to
Mr. Payne.

     I make the plea on behalf of us all, perhaps even if
we undertake to pay the copying charges.   If one copy of
each interview could be released so it could then be
passed around and then copies could be taken perhaps by
our individual instructing solicitors so we don't have to
pay the lOp, or 20p or 25p per sheet.




              THE CORONER:   Yes, I quite understand..
                                                            51




      THE CORONER:      Yes, I quite understand. I entirely
take your point.     I admire you, if I may put it like that,
at the skill with which you take notes.     I wish I was as
good, but to take    notes of four or five hours of interviews
is very difficult    and very tiring. I put it no higher than
that.  So I do quite understand what you are saying and if
I can help either by producing three or four copies so that
people could cluster around and then if you wanted to make
some extra ones I d o n 't think I would mind of the PACE
transcript.

      MR. ISAACS: All that we ask then, sir, that these be
given to us in good time so that the copying can take place.

      THE CORONER:  Yes, it won't be possible to do it in
good time for Superintendent Marshall because hopefully we
are starting tomorrow and it is now lunchtime.

      MR. ISAACS:    Even that would be sufficient time, sir,
with respect.

      THE CORONER:    Yes, Mr. Hale?

      MR. HALE:  Sir, I interest myself in technical matters
and respectfully suggest if copies are to be made at all
then it should be done by a big machine with a collating
ability because otherwise if you merely pass one copy to me
and ask me to copy it it is an enormous job.

      THE CORONER:    We will see what we can do.

      MR. HALE:  While one copy is being made, and there are
commercial offices nearby who could do it, they could collate,
turn out as many copies as you are wanting at the same time
as it takes to do one copy and it would all be collated and
in the proper order, stapled together and so on and then I
am sure we would all share the cost and that would be a much
simpler way.

      THE CORONER:    I will do what I can on that point.

      MR. MANNING:   I am sorry to have to come to my feet
again sir, but there is a view that I must express on behalf
of my client and that is his Police and Criminal Evidence Act
statement is of course a very privileged document.   It is
taken in controlled circumstances and in a particular way of
which you are well aware and at this moment in time there
is a very limited availability of that statement to anybody.

      There is you as the Coroner.  There is the West Midlands
Police who took on the instructions and there is myself and
my client as the people concerned in it and whilst I accept
and fully appreciate, as one who has been writing just as hard
                                                       52




as everybody else, the desirability to have a statement
in front of them, on the other hand I don't think in any
way, shape or form I can concede that there be a statement
photocopied in advance and sent around, even to legal
representatives, in advance of the day in which my client
is actually going to be there for his statement.

      If you say that what you intend by the distribution
is that when the client is in the witness box and the statement
is about to be performed or heard on the tape you will then
or there will be a facility for that to be distributed in
whatever form it is done, then I can see the commonsense of
it because to have something in front of you which you can
then follow through obviously is sensible, but in advance
of that I am very strongly against it.

      THE CORONER:  In fact Mr. King actually asked for
the latter. We have moved on a     tiny bit from there but I
think in principle I agree with you because once I say you
can have these in advance so that you can prepare then
Mr. Payne is quite right, why shouldn't he have all the
other statements to prepare in advance, but what I have in
mind, and in that sense may be Mr. Isaacs perhaps I am a
little tiny bit against you in that because I think it was
you who said ....

      MR. ISAACS: I said there   were two reasons and I
understood certainly from my learned friend Mr. King
that the first reason was also a reason, namely to give
him an opportunity to prepare beforehand.

      THE CORONER: Well I am sure that is a reason but
I think from a fairness point of view it probably is right,
that we will try and get copies either sufficient or some
to share and give them to you on the day and that at least
will save you writing continuously, you can amend as you
wish, if there are any typographical errors or anything
else. What else you do with it is up to you because you
can make your notes by hearing and writing or by reading
and writing.  It does not make much difference. Yes,
Mr. Payne, you have got a point*

      MR. ISAACS: I was only going to say, sir, that I
agree entirely and indeed support what has been said
by my learned friend Mr. Manning.

      MR. PAYNE: Sir, if this discussion is to be resolved
that when the witness's PACE statement starts being played,
the recording of it starts being played, then at that moment
copies of the transcript are circulated as an aid to note
taking, then I don't think there can be any objection to
that.
      THE CORONER: That is what I intend to do. I don't
think we need to take it any further. My primary point
was could we get it done, you know could we actually
produce the copy?

      MR. PAYNE: May I say just before I sit down.   If
there were, I see Mr. King may be about to rise again, no,
then if it is left at that I have nothing further to say.
I was merely going to observe that Mr. Limb has very help­
fully done some research while this has been going on and
it is quite clear there is quite a body of legal authority
on the point which is now being discussed which certainly
for my own part I have not researched at the moment.
However, if it is to be resolved in the way in which you say
I don't think there can be any objection to that.

      THE CORONER: To save me hunting through the book
just give me the page number?

     MR. PAYNE:      Page 148 and the Supplement.

      THE CORONER:    Thank you.

      MR. KING: Sir, can I say if one looks back to the
transcript of this discussion what I asked for was what
we have arrived at.

      THE CORONER: Yes, I know, I agree.   It was partly
my fault because I was hesitating on the practicalities.

      I want to say one other thing on these PACE statements
because we may as well clear the ground on this.

      There were PACE statements taken in connection with
basically the DPP enquiry and there were supplemental
statements taken under caution in connection with
disciplinary matters. Those I will not produce. They have
nothing whatever to do with this Inquest and I say that now
and I want to say it openly so that everybody knows that
we are not doing anything underhand, under cover. Yes,
Mrs. McBrien?

      MRS. McBRIEN: All this seems very complicated to
me and obviously it is way over my head.  I may be completely
wrong in thinking this, but does it mean that the witnesses
are still going to be questioned as comprehensively as they
have been in the past from now on by yourself?

      THE CORONER: Oh yes. The problem, Mrs. McBrien,
is that tomorrow when we put the video on there is a bundle,
it has all been typed already, and there is a bundle two-and-
a-half times as thick as this approximately, which is the
typed version of what the jury are going to have to listen
to.
      Now if you want to write that all down it is hard
work.  If we give you a copy of the bundle you can listen
and not look at it or you can listen and look it and read
it and say:  "This is interesting" or "The typing is wrong"
it just helps you with the scribbling and that is what it
is intended for, but the questioning of the witnesses will
be exactly the same as it has been before.

      These witnesses who have given PACE statements may
not in fact be questioned quite as extensively because
they have got certain privileges and it depends upon the
questions - we have gone over this already right at the
beginning, you probably remember - but no we are not
chopping witnesses except where we may find some witnesses .
where there is no dispute with regard to what they are
saying in which case you might read their evidence, and
there will be some witnesses, as I say I am going to do
a cull.  I did say that right in the beginning if you
remember and I think at what we call the business meeting
I said when we had heard a certain amount of evidence ....
That is right, you wanted me to circulate the list of the
names and I hesitated because I said as soon as I have
circulated the lists you are going to say:  "We want them
all" and I said at the time that the list was only provisional
it was a first collection, but as we went along I might well
start either deleting people or postponing them or reassessing
them and in fact I have already done it.   That is what I
intend to do, but the final decision on whether we call a
witness will always be mine and the quality, I hope, if
it is quality, the quality of the examination should not
diminish provided we don't flag.

      MRS. McBRIEN: Yes, and getting back to the statements
that are going to be distributed to the legal representatives
and myself, will we all get those statements?

      THE CORONER: Well that is what we were discussing.
Either you will all get them, or none will get them, or
we will have them between threes so that you can all read
them, but we will not privilege any one as against the other
so it will be fair.

      MRS. McBRIEN:   They will be at a cost of course?

      THE CORONER: If you do it you will get those for
nothing. How is that?  (Laughter)

      MR. HALE: Could I rise on just one other point sir
while we are in this condition.

      I personally have made an error in reading some
document. I have reason to believe others may have made
the same error, I am not sure, and that is the number of
people among the deceased who were over the driving limit.
                                                          55




It was said to be 15 plus 6, or it looked as though it
was 15 plus 6 and I have referred to it on more than
one occasion as 21.

      It is quite clear now you have kindly referred me
to Dr. Forrest's evidence, it is quite clear that the six
were included in the 15 and therefore the number is only
15, not 21.

      Now I merely want to say that in the PACE statement
that error may have been perpetuated.   Everybody of course
is entitled to says  "We will have to stick by that" but
it would be a shame to me to have everybody for five or
six or eight hours thinking 21 is the figure or disagreeing
with it, only to be told at the end subsequent research
has shown that that figure is incorrect, so it is a matter
for you sir whether at the outset whether that should be
mentioned, but if that figure arises then subsequent
research has shown that it is in error.

      THE CORONER:  In other words it is overstated in
the PACE statement.  Of course we would correct it at the
end but what you are saying is it might be better to
correct it at the beginning?

      MR. HALE:   Indeed sir.

      MR. KING:   I don't know, it may be helpful if my
friend Mr. Hale does indicate, I suspect I know his answer
and   it was a shorthand way of doing it, but I have certainly
been asked to ask this question to you sir: "What relevance
does the driving limit have to those who died on the football
ground?"

      THE CORONER: Well that is a matter for me. Mr. Hale
was actually trying to correct an error. I will deal with
that when I do my summing up as far as I am able.

      MR. KING:  Sir, you understand why I asked the question
because you can also understand why those behind me listen
to it and it concerns them quite obviously.

      THE CORONER:   Of   course, yes.   It   is simply a marker.

      MR. PAYNE: Sir, this is a nettle which may have to
be grasped at some time and since it has come up and the
jury are not here it might be a convenient time to at least
attempt to get hold of it at the moment.

      There is an analysis of the blood alcohol content of
all the people who died and it has produced a result and one
can see numbers of people who have not taken .any alcohol
at all and some who had taken a small amount of alcohol
and some who had taken enough to be over the driving limit
just as the result.
                                   Now, a lot of the ....
                                                     56




     Now, a lot of the Inquest has been taken up in
investigating the amount that people had had to drink,
and the general level of supporters who had attended at
the ground, both from the point of view of outside
observers, local residents in observing who was
drinking what and so on, and what their behaviour was,
and also from the point of view of supporters who
actually attended at the ground, and a great deal of
investigation has gone on to find out how much they had
had to drink and how much it affected their behaviour.

     Of course, there is no scientific way of measuring
how this actually affected the total concentration of
people in the pens, but from the blood alcohol analysis
which was in fact carried out for those who
unfortunately died, a pattern does emerge, I am
speaking in broad terms, of about 50 per cent who had
not had anything to drink at all, and then gradually
going up until one comes to reasonably high levels.   It
could well be that all the evidence about who had drunk
how much before arriving at the ground, from the point .
of view of outside observers and from the point of view
of spectators who actually went in, all that could be
short-circuited if it were thought reasonable to take
this blood sample analysis as representative of the
people in the terrace as a whole.  If that was so then
it would work out roughly speaking in those
proportions.  I am speaking without actually having the
figures in front of me.

     THE CORONER:   I understand.

     MR. PAYNE:   Roughly speaking it would work out 50
per cent nothing at all and then the other 50 per cent
gradually rising to quite high levels.  Now that would
short-circuit a lot of the evidence about who had had
how much to drink and so on, if that were thought to be
a fair way of getting a representation of what the
amount of drink had been.

      I am saying that at this stage because that
evidence is available and if it becomes necessary, as
undoubtedly it will do, for the Jury to consider the
relevance of the amount of drink which had been
consumed to the overall happening of the disaster, then
this would be some independent and scientific evidence
of analysis which might help them to form a view about
that.

     THE CORONER:   I have been thinking quite hard
about the analysis myself and I have been trying to do
a little bit of work on it too.  It is a very
interesting topic actually.  Obviously I am willing to
listen to anything your colleagues wish to say to me on
                                                      57




the matter, but the bit that I am a little bit
reluctant or concerned about is this, that although we
have had quite a lot of supporters up to now, if you
like the bulk, if I can use that expression, of the
witnesses are coining in the future. If we cease to ask
the question then - in some ways, you see, what we are
trying to find out is the perception of people as to
what happened and what effect it had, and whether
perceptions differ, for instance, between different
groups and classes on the same sort of event, but the
bit that worries me is that if we stop now then it may
be that the impression is given that we have allowed
this evidence to come out from Police witnesses,
because we have heard a lot of Police witnesses as it
happens, that is just in the nature of the Inquest, and
that we are not allowing it to come out from the
supporters, who may have a different perception of the
situation.

     I am inclined to think that we certainly want to
go on for the time being.  It may be that - this is
your point, Mr. Catchpole - by the middle of next week
when we have heard another 30 or 40 or 50 supporters,
we might be able to say to ourselves, "Hang on, we know
what has happened outside the gate at 2.30 We know
what the bulk of the supporters are saying", and I may
just stop asking the question because I will have felt
that we have got a fair balance.

     You can never be entirely fair because in the end
it is always which witness have you called.  I have
done my best but we can always argue about that. One
does one's best but what the Jury make of all this
evidence at the end and how it is analysed out in their
mind, or indeed how I sum it up to them, we will have
to see.  I appreciate your suggestion was intended, I
am sure helpfully, in order to save time.

     MR* PAYNE:   Sir, I hope you don't think there is
any criticism intended in the way in which you have led
the evidence so far about these witnesses, because
there certainly isn't any. All I am observing is that
as a matter of impression from the supporters who have
given evidence, and the local residents who have given
their observations of behaviour, actually it works out
very much along the same pattern as the blood alcohol
analysis, namely that some people had very little and
some people who have given evidence clearly had a great
deal, so that there is a consistent pattern.

     MR. KING:   The difficulty I find myself in is I
am always anxious to help and always anxious to shorten
matters, but there is a lovely word which is used
throughout, and I agree with the word, which is that of
perception.  There is not only the perception of what
happened on the day but there is the perception of how
we are conducting ourselves, and the point you have
made, sir, is one which is very important, that is to
say we have heard a lot of oral evidence from Police
Officers, and much as I might be able to say to those I
represent, "Look, this is a sensible way of dealing
with it", it would never remove the concern that in
shortening matters one is ignoring what may have been
vital evidence to give a different picture.  It may not
have been but that perception is there and that is the
first ....

     THE CORONER:   That is what I perceive and that is
why I answered Mr. Payne in the way I did.

     MR. KING:   I give nothing away when I say I have
received four bits of paper already in the last two
minutes.  Sir, another matter which is also of concern
which we can't ignore on the drink issue is not merely
what the perception was but what should have been
perceived, and what was reasonably to be expected in
planning the match and so forth, and that issue is not
going to go away in that context.  It is very difficult
to separate the two because one is not dealing with
simply what was happening on the day but what should
have been anticipated at a football match, and to what
extent that issue is linked in with the evidence we
have heard today and so forth.

     THE CORONER:   I think that I have indicated that
for the time being I want to continue more or less.   I
know in some ways it looks as if I am obsessed with
this topic, but I am not.  I think it is an important
aspect of the matter and I think it has got to be
aired.  It has got to be aired fully and properly so
that at the end of the day whether the evidence has
come out in the way (a) wants it, or (b) wants it, or
(c) wants it, it is neither here nor there to me which
way in the end the evidence comes out, but at the end
of the day I would like to think that we have aired it,
and the Jury can then - I hope I will direct them
correctly and adequately on the matter - apply their
minds and weigh it and decided your point on the
planning, Mr. Payne's view of the behavioural effects,
other points of view which there may be. They will
have to balance it all up and come to a conclusion
which they will bring in as their verdict.

     MR.   KING:   I understand throughout, of course,
that the   use of the issue as to the amount of drinking,
treating   it by reference to the drink/driving level, is
merely a   convenient way of showing a certain level of
alcohol.    Sir, the danger, however, of throughout
                                                         59




discussing it in those terms is it gives again a
perception that what we are concerned with is whether
or not it is reasonable or unreasonable for people to
attend a football match who may or may not have been
fit to drive a car, which is a very different issue as
to the attendance at a football match and their safety
at a football match as a pedestrian.   Sir, I understand
that perfectly but I do know again from the sheets of
paper I have received in the last few minutes, that
that is a matter which does concern those who listen,
and for all I know   may concern theJury because they
are ordinary members of the public too, that if we talk
throughout in terms of, "Were you over the limit, were
you fit to drive a car?", it may not be totally helpful
always to put it in those terms when discussing
attending a football match.   That is all I say, sir.

     THE CORONER:     I think on thewhole I have managed
to avoid that most   of the time.  Ihave mentioned the
figures ....

     MR. KING:   You have, sir, I know.

     THE CORONER:   But I can also understand, when we
are talking without the Jury here, that Mr. Hale might
wish to make a shortened point by saying he has a
figure, which I understand.

     MR. KING:   As I understand it the submission of
my learned friend Mr. Hale was to collate evidence
which would be put to the Jury in that form.

     THE CORONER:   I think the point at the end of the
day is going to be that the Jury will have to make up
their mind.  As I say I have not yet formalised my
summing up, but at the end of the day I hope that I
will put to the Jury the evidence, collect together
bits which I consider to be important, maybe re-cast it
and re-schedule it, and hopefully be sufficiently
astute to explain to them the difference between a
person who is (a) a pedestrian/passenger and a driver,
(b) the differences between the behavioural effects, if
any - effects on behaviour - and driving skills, which
may also not be the same, and draw to their attention
maybe any other conclusions which you can draw from
these figures - it would not be for me to draw the
conclusions to their attention, but draw to their
attention matters which they may wish to consider, if
they think it is appropriate and relevant.

     So I am very conscious of what you are saying, and
I will do my best. Whether I succeed you will judge at
the end.  It is a very difficult problem, the summing
up.  It gives me a lot of worry, I can tell you.
                                                         60




     Is there anything else you want to say or shall we
have lunch?

     Mr. King, you have mentioned instructions and
notes, and obviously your clients are entitled to do
that and they should do it. What I was going to say
was this:  I am trying to say to you and indeed to
everybody else, that as far as I can I will do my best
in the summing up and I am aware of these differences.

     It would be helpful if you and your instructing
solicitors could try to reassure your clients.   At the
end of the day they may still think I have got it
wrong, I don't know about that.  I can't guarantee that
everybody will walk out of this Court satisfied.   They
will not, in fact - I can almost guarantee that they
will not - but try and reassure them that as far as I
am able I am conscious of the concerns, and indeed that
goes for all the people who are represented.   Everybody
has an anxiety in this matter.

     I find it very strange because it is unusual for
the verdict in an inquest actually to matter very much.
The important thing in an inquest is actually hearing
the evidence, that is my normal perception, but in this
particular inquest the verdict does play a large part,
so I am very conscious that I must do my very best with
the summing up and to do it correctly and fairly.
Whether I succeed in the end, of course, you will
judge, but try and reassure your clients that not every
time something is mentioned about alcohol levels or
behaviour that that is it, and the other way round.   Of
course, you are entitled to cross-examine, challenge,
make sure that the evidence that we actually get is as
accurate as we can get, and Mr. Langley was a very good
witness.  The Jury are not here so I can say it, I
thought he was an excellent witness.  My impression was
that he was doing his very best and I can't ask more of
a witness than that. Whether he gave the answers we
wanted is another matter but he did his best and that
is all we can ask.

     MR. KING:   I am grateful for those words because
it makes my task easier.  I know, sir, your position
and I know what you are trying to do, and as you have
indicated, sir, perceptions can alter at different
stages of an inquest.

     THE CORONER:   You see, I have not talked to
everybody personally - I think that would be wrong, so
I don't. Thank you very much indeed. We will have
lunch now.

                        Bv THE CORONER?

Q. It is Michael Thomas Hollinghurst? - A. Yes.

Q. Of                                   Liverpool? - A.
   N o , I nave changed addresses since then.

Q. Tell us what it is now? - A.
         St. Helens since June last year.

Q. You are a charge nurse by profession? - A. Yes, that
   is right.

Q. And also a football fan? - A. Yes.

Q.   Following Liverpool I take it?   - A. Quite right.

Q.    Is it right that on 15th April 1989 you went to the
     football ground in Sheffield to see the Semi Final? -
     A. Yes.

Q. Am I right in thinking that you went by car? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You left I think at about 10.30 with four friends? -
   A. Yes.

Q. What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. We
   actually parked the car up at about 2.15.

Q.   That was quite a long journey.   Was there any reason
     for that? - A. There was quite a lot of traffic in
     and around the Stockport area but when we got almost
     to the end of the Woodhead Pass we decided to call
     and have something to eat as a couple of us had not
     brought anything to eat and we called in for
     something to eat and a drink.

Q. You stopped at the Woodhead Pass? - A. At the very
   end, the Sheffield end.

Q. What time did you get to this place where you
   stopped, about? - A. About 1 to 1.15.

Q. You had something to eat and then you     came on? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Having parked, you made your way to the ground? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You do not know where you parked I take it? - A.
   Overton Road.
                                                              62

Q. How far from the ground? - A. I would say it is about
   a ten minute walk.

Q. Were there other supporters going to the ground at
   the same time? - A. Yes.

Q. Liverpool or others? - A. Mainly Liverpool.

Q. Did you notice anything about their behaviour which
   worried you in any way? - A. No, everybody was good
   humoured.

Q. Did you see anybody drinking cans of alcohol? - A.
   There were the odd ones but not excessive numbers.

Q. What I am interested in is - and I am not trying to
   pin you down to say if there were 22 - an approximate
   percentage of the total crowd that you saw in your
   judgement? - A.   Of people who were walking to the
   ground who were actually drinking?

Q. Yes. - A. Not a   high percentage at all.       As Isay, we
   saw the odd one or two.

Q. Very few as far as you were concerned and their
   behaviour was fine? - A. Everybody was good humoured,
   yes.

Q. I think you got to Leppings Lane at about 2.25? - A.
   Yes, an approximate time.

Q. What was it like outside? - A. We immediately made
   towards where the turnstiles were and there were a
   few hundred or maybe a thousand or so people already
   around the turnstile area.

Q. When you say the   turnstile area do you mean the
   actual turnstile   area or the area outside the
   perimeter gates?   - A. The area that actually leads
   down towards the   turnstile.

Q. Had you been there before? - A. The previous year.

Q. So you had been there before? - A. Yes.

Q. So there were about 500 to 1,000 people? - A. Making
   a rough estimate, yes.

Q. Just look at the model so that we get it right.   Just
   show him the turnstile area ( indicating\. Are we
   talking about that area there or the area outside the
   gates? - A. We immediately went down to the area that
   has got a partition dividing it down the middle
   leading towards the turnstiles.
                                                                63

Q. That is the turnstiles A to G? - A. I think that is
   the area we went down to, yes.

Q. That is    the area where the people    were? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you  see any mounted Officers or anybody else? -
   A. I noticed in particular one mounted Officer who I
   had seen several times outside Liverpool's ground.

Q. Where was he? - A. He was in that area.

Q. Did you   see what he was doing, if   anything? - A. He
   was trying to get some kind of order, people to queue
   in some kind of order.

Q. Why did he not succeed? - A. There were already a
   mass of people.  There would be no particular queues.
   There didn't appear to me at that stage to be anybody
   sectioning people into queues which is the kind of
   arrangement I am used to when I go to football
   matches at Liverpool certainly.

Q. Because the configuration at Liverpool is completely
   different, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. Was there any pushing? - A. As I say, there was no
   order at all and so there were no orderly queues and
   there didn't seem any facility for making any orderly
   queues.  People were just sort of massed in what was
   really a small area trying to get through a few
   turnstiles.

Q.   Did you see anybody distressed? - A. Yes.

Q.   In that area I am talking about? - A. Yes, becoming
     more so over the next few minutes.

Q.    Why was    that? - A. The crush got more and more.We
     arrived and more and more people were arriving behind
     us and so the numbers we are talking about originally
     obviously were swelled by the people arriving behind
     us.

Q. Did you feel anybody pushing you? - A. Everybody was
   being pushed.  It got to the stage where there was a
   crush of people and, in fact, some people were
   distressed and trying to make their way back out of
   the crush outside the turnstiles.

Q. You did not take that course? - A. No.

Q. Does that mean you were not particularly
   distressed? - A. Yes, I was quite frightened at that
   stage actually as most people around me were, you
   know.
                                                            64

Q. At this point, as I understand it, you could not help
   yourself any more? - A. No, as I say, I got into that
   area and people were arriving behind us and it just
   gradually got worse.

Q. Did you hear anybody making appeals for people not to
   push? - A. People were shouting all sorts of things,
   "Don't push, there are people getting hurt, there are
   people getting crushed".

Q. It made no difference? - A. No, it didn't seem to
   make any difference at all.

Q. You entered through a turnstile, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You did not see any of the big gates open, is that
   correct, or did you? - A. I didn't, no.

Q. Having got in, do you know what time it was that you
   got in by any chance? - A. Only judging by the next
   few minutes I would say between ten to and five to
   three.

Q. That is an estimate, is it? - A. That is an estimate,
   yes.

Q. You do not actually know the exact time? - A. I don't
   remember looking at the time.

Q. Having got in did you go down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. When you got to the entry of the tunnel before you
   went down did you by chance look towards the pitch? -
   A. Through the tunnel?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, that is what I am basing the time on
   because as we were entering the tunnel the players
   were on the pitch.  The match hadn't started.

Q. We know what time that was and your time is quite
   accurate actually. At the entry of the tunnel the
   players were on the pitch.  You could see them, could
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. What was the tunnel like? Was it empty, full, or
   were you able to get down it? That is what I am
   trying to find out? - A. We were getting down it.
   There were a lot of people going down but it wasn't
   crushed. A lot of people were making their way
   through the tunnel.

Q. Before you went in you actually heard people talking.
   I think you mentioned that you heard stewards or
   somebody saying, "Plenty of room inside" or words to
   that effect? - A. Yes.

Q. Where was that? - A. Once we got through the
   turnstile everybody thought they were out of the
   worst of it because it was such a bad crush outside
   and we were relieved to get through.  Of the four of
   us who were making their way through the turnstiles
   we lost one and so the three of us were still left on
   the groundside of the turnstile and we met up
   together.  Obviously we wanted to make our way
   straight into the ground and there were stewards
   around and a couple of Police Officers.  I distinctly
   remember a Police Officer saying, "Hake your way
   straight in. There is plenty of room on the
   terraces, plenty of room inside".

   "May your way through"? - A. Just generally.   He just
   said, "Make your way in."

Q. He didn't point in any way.   He just said, "In lads", or
   words to that effect, "There's plenty of room"'? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it said to you personally or just generally? - A. No.
   I mean, within a couple of feet of me as I was making my
   way.

Q. Down you went down this tunnel and you got to the other
   end of it, of course? - A. Yes.

Q. You went left or right? - A. Left.

Q. When you got on to that terrace - we call it pen 4 - tell
   me what happened and how it was? - A. Well, on the way
   through the tunnel the three of us were still together.
   Having been there the previous year, as I have said, when
   it was quite full the previous seasons we had noticed
   that the terracing to the left corner had been
   particularly empty yet Where we were was crushed, the
   season before.    Even going through the tunnel, and as
   far as I can remember even on the way to the natch that
   day,  we said we would make our way to that left terrace.

Q. That   is the banked one, the high one? - A. The left hand
   corner behind the goal.    Of course, not knowing that
   that end was penned off in separate pens. We thought it
   was all one complete terracing.

Q. So that was your objective to get... - A. Out of where it
   was crushed.

Q. You entered pen 4, however, because you were expecting to
   walk along the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Just describe to me what that pen was   like when you
   entered it? - A. It was quite full - well, very full, but
   nothing that I had not seen on a football terrace before.
   It was fairly fluid because we could nake our way
   through, albeit it was a struggle at first for a few
   minutes.    Then it suddenly became more and more tightly
   packed by the minute really.

Q. Do you recollect when you first entered, when you said it
   was quite fluid, had the match kicked-off? - A. No.

Q. It had not? - A. No.

Q. Then you say it became tighter, that was the word you
   used.   Do you recollect what time that was in relation
   to the match?   I am not asking you to tell me what time
                                                             67

                                          M. T .   H O LLING HUR ST


   it was, but in relation to what was going on on the
   pitch? - A. I think we are talking about around kick-off
   time that it really became oppressive and got more and
   more so in the next few minutes.

Q. The tightness, was it coming from behind you? - A. As far
   as I could gather it was coming from behind me.

Q. You had initially made your way in, as you say, and then
   it got tighter.   Did you come to a stop? - A. I think
   what we actually did was come across the dividing fence,
   that we didn't know was there, obviously.   Then we just
   came to halt and stopped virtually where we were.

Q. Against that fence? - A. We came back in slightly and
   then.

Q. So you were able to move off the fence at that stage? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Was that kick-off time or before? - A. That was just
   before kick-off time we hit that fence. Roundabout kick-
   off time we are talking about now.

Q. At that point had you ever been in a situation like this
   before on the terrace? - A. No, that is when it started
   to become really frightening then because...

Q. You are saying at kick-off time it became frightening? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Up to then you had coped, so to speak? - A. Yes.   As I
   say, I have been in football crowds before but it became
   unlike any football crowd I had ever been in before.

Q. I think you were rotated once or twice, is that right? -
   A. Certainly once, yes. At one stage I had my back
   completely to the pitch, facing upwards towards the
   stand.

Q. Did you see people being pulled up at that point? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Then did you manage to turn round again or were you moved
   round? - A. I just remember that...   I did get back the
   other way.   I don't know how I managed to do it.

Q. You had lost your friends by that time? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?   What did you see or notice? - A.
   The crush got worse rather than better and after a few
   minutes I was aware that somebody was on the ground right
   by Where I was standing, by where I was positioned.
                                                                 68

                                              M. T .   H O LLING HUR ST


Q. Was the match still in progress when you became aware of
   this or can you not remember? - A. Yes, the match was
   going on.

Q. This was in fact a young man? - A. That's right.

Q. Being a charge nurse you checked to see whether his pulse
   was going and things like that, as soon as you could? -
   A. Yes, but not at that particular moment.

Q. I realise that. - A. As soon as the crowd cleared...

Q. That is in fact   my next question.   How long did it take
   before you were   able to get at this lad? - A. I really
   could not put a   timescale on it because it just seemed
   like forever.     It seemed like it was getting tighter and
   tighter and you   were fighting for your breath.   It was
   probably only a   matter of ten minutes at the moment, five
   or ten minutes.

Q. I presume the match had stopped by then? - A. By that
   stage, yes.

Q.   Did you see it stop? - A. I was not   aware   of what was
     going on to be quite honest.

Q. Most people aren't... - A. I was not aware of when the
   match particularly stopped or when...

Q. Most people can remember bits but they do have great
   difficulty with timing so don't be concerned about that.
   What you are saying is that the pressure eased after
   several minutes, it is difficult to say how many but
   after several minutes? - A. Yes, the pressure began to
   ease and a space...

Q. Then you were able to get down? - A. People were in more
   and more space and that is When I actually saw someone on
   the ground below me.

Q.   As I say, at that point that iswhen you had a look to
     see Whether there was anything that could be done for
     this lad? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact I think you came to the conclusion there wasn't,
   is that right? - A. I tried, as well as the lad who was
   immediately below me.  There was somebody just a couple
   of feet further away.  He was also in the sane
   condition.

Q. So you tried for both of them? - A. Yes, I was going
   back...
                                                             69

                                          M. T .   H O LLING HUR ST


Q. Did you know whether the other person recovered?        Have
   you any idea? - A. Pardon?

Q. Do you know anything about the other person, not the lad?
   He know about the lad because you identified him, didn't
   you, in due course? - A. I believe...   Well, I
   identified the other person as well.   I believe they are
   both deceased.

Q. It was somebody called Paul Carlile? - A. The young man
   was.




              Q. He was the first
                                                           70


                                  M .T.   HO LLING HURST



Q. He was the first one of the two whom you tried to help?
   - A. Yes, he was the one who was immediately next to
   me and the one who I had been aware of originally.

Q. Did you see any activity on the perimeter fence? - A.
   By that stage people were trying with their bare hands
   to rip the fence, you know get the fence down. That is
   what I was aware of going on around me, people were
   pulling at the fence.

Q. Were you attempting to help the lad when people were
   attempting to pull the fence down or was it earlier.
   Can you remember that? - A. From what I can remember as
   I was helping the young lad and the other fellow people
   were frantically trying to get the fence down.

Q. But it had not yet come down? - A. No, they had made
   a hole. There may have been a gate opened, I don't
   know.

Q. Would that have been at the same time as you were
   resuscitating the lad or had you already started
   resuscitation earlier? - A. Well immediately there
   was any space at all when I saw the lad under my feet.

Q. Of course that is what you were concentrating on? -
   A. Yes.

Q. And how did you get out yourself? - A. Through a hole
   in the fence eventually.

Q. You went frontways? - A. Somebody picked me up and
   said:  "It is time for you to get out yourself". By
   that time I think two ambulancemen had arrived and
   taken over from me trying to resuscitate.

Q. Somebody had come into the pen? - A. Yes.

Q. Well I know, I think I know anyway that the family
   were very grateful that you were there with regard
   to that young man, Paul Carlisle.

         Do you remember this was the witness whom we
   discovered so to speak half way through the Inquests
   in April and May so I thought it would be good to have
   him in here.


                 Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Hollinghurst, can you just help us a little about
   your experience in 1988 the previous semi-final. You
   gave some evidence that you had made your mind up in
   1989 that if you could you would go to a different
   place? - A. Yes.
T                                           M .T.   HO LLING HURST
                                                                     71




        Q. Where had you been on the terraces in 1988? - A. I think
           we were, it would probably be Pen 3, the one to the
           right of the tunnel.

    B   Q. As you come down the tunnel        A. Rather than the one
           to the left, yes.

        Q. And what had been your experiences in that pen in 1988
           which had led you to make the decision you had for 1989?
           - A. Well it was quite crushed.  It was quite crushed
           in relation obviously to the situation that we could see
           in the corner of the pitch which is why we made the
           decision in 1989 to try and make our way in that direction

        Q. I am sorry to press you a little, but when you mean
           "crushed" could you put that into perhaps a little detail
           of what it meant as far as space went of the people around
           you? - A. Well it was a heavy football crowd. As I said
           when I first came in 1989 it was probably still fluid but
           there were quite a lot of people in that particular area
           compared to an area which was a few yards away where
           there was nobody as far as we could see.
    D
        Q. I just want to go back to 1988 because you clearly had
           been concerned of what had happened in 1988? - A. Yes.

        Q. What had been your concern? - A. I thought somebody may
           have been injured in 1988 and at half-time people were
           clambering into the Stand in 1988 during the half-time
           break out of that pen.
\       Q. Do you mean clambering up ....   A. They were being
           helped up into the seated area at half-time to get out
           of the standing area.

                 MR. KING: Thank you.   I ought to say because as
           you know I represent, or you may not know, a large
           number of the be.reaved and injured including the
           family of the boy who you helped.  Can I say also on
           behalf of them how grateful they are for what you did.
           Thank you.


                       Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

        Q. Mr. Hollinghurst, when you said you got to Leppings Lane
           at 2.25.did you mean right at the top of Leppings Lane
           or did that mean right by the perimeter gate? - A. No,
           we made our way straight down to where the entrance was.

        Q. What I am trying to find out   is where you were at 2.25?
           - A. We went straight to the   turnstile area.  From
           walking from the car we went   straight to the ground, we
           didn't make a stop anywhere,   we just went straight to
           the ground to get in.
                                                               72


                                      M iT.   HO LLING HURST




Q. How did you know it was 2.25. Why did you say that
   time? - A. That is just a rough estimate. Approximately
   2.25 judging on the events that, you know, my perception
   of the events that followed.

Q. So you are not absolutely sure about the time then? -
   A. I did not look at my watch at that particular time.

Q. What was it like anyway when you got to Leppings Lane,
   was it easy enough to walk right down to the perimeter
   gate? - A. Down to the area where the turnstiles was but
   as I say there were probably 500/1000 people already in
   that area. They were in that area, the immediate area
   before the turnstiles and obviously trying to get into
   the ground at that time.

Q. So the crowds were mainly congested just near the perimeter
   gate, they weren't spreading up the Lane at the time? -
   A. I don't know what you mean by the "perimeter gate"?

Q. The main gate before the turnstile area? - A. They were
   in the area that you funnelled into before the turnstiles.

         MRS. McBRIEN:   All right.      Thank you very much.


                    Further By The CORONER:

Q. 1988, do you know what time you arrived in 1988 as a
   matter of interest? - A. I could not tell you sorry.

Q. We want you to mark the plan, want you to show us where
   you were. We are asking all the witnesses.   If you would
   walk up to the overhead. - A. Is it where I ended up?

Q. What I want you to show me, I want you to mark the position
   where you were with a cross where you finished up near the
   lad whom you helped.  Point out which is Pen 4? Before
   you mark it you had told me that you were next to the
   perimeter fence. Are you saying that you managed to move
   back off, the radial fence, you moved back off it, didn't
   you? - A. When we came to a halt in the fence we just
   stepped back inside.

         THE CORONER:    Mark it then.     That is fine.

         MR. BEECHEY:    345 sir.

         THE CORONER:    Thank you.

Q. When you   got to the radial fence before you moved back
   off, was   that when kick-off had taken place or had
   kick-off   not yet taken place.  I just can't remember
   what you   told me? - A. I don't think the match had kicked
   off.
                                                              73

Q. I see and it was at that position which you have marked
   which is when the kick-off .... A. Well it must have
   been because that is where we sort of suddenly came to
   a halt.

         THE CORONER:   Thank you very much      indeed.

                                                                75

   having a couple   of cans of beer.

Q. A couple of people you say? - A. A few.

Q. Can you put a percentage on it? - A. About a quarter of
   the people that were walking down.

Q. We are just trying to get a picture of what different
   people saw, that's all. They were singing and they
   were happy? - A. Yes, merry.

Q. Merry, that is the word you would like to use? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Having waited for your friend at the telephone kiosk,
   he joined you and did you then carry on towards the
   ground? - A. Yes, we carried on walking down until we
   got to the train station.  There was a burger bar
   there, we were told to put the cans down there by the
   Police, told to finish the drinks or just leave them
   behind because we could not drink beyond that point.

Q. Near the railway station - not at the railway station
   but on the road near the railway station? - A. Yes.

Q. Did they, as a matter of interest, apart from the
   drinks ask you anything about tickets? - A. No.

Q. They didn't? - A. No.

Q.   You did that I take it, you drank up? - A. I drank up.

Q.   Then you carried on towards   Leppings Lane? - A. Carried
     on walking up.

Q. What time did you get to the turnstile area? - A. It
   was about 20-to-3.

0. You had been last year so you knew where to go? - A.
   Yes.

Q. What was it like when you got there at 20-to-3? - A. It
   was pretty packed inside the turnstile area.

Q. When you say inside the turnstile area, do you mean
   between the perimeter gates and the turnstile? - A.
   Yes.
                                                                76



                                               L.   F.   CAMPBELL




Q. Do you know what I mean by the perimeter gates? - A.
   The big blue gates.

Q.   The big blue gates, yes.   Was itpacked outside those?
     - A. Well, people were still walking down, hanging
     around waiting for the queues to go down, but it was
     getting late, towards kick-off, so people started to
     hurry in.

Q. Were the gates open, those perimeter gates, can you
   remember? - A. Yes, they were.

Q. They were? - A. They were to start off with.

Q.    Did you see any Officers, either mounted or otherwise?
     - A.I seen one mounted Officer.    I have seen him at
     Anfield.

Q. He is a Mersey chap? - A. Yes.

Q. Where was he? - A. He was in front of the perimeter
   gates? The turnstile side of the perimeter gates - he
   was inside.

Q. Inside but near the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you notice what he was doing? - A. He was trying to
   get an orderly queue going but the people at the
   turnstiles were checking everyone so he couldn't quite
   get them to be orderly, because there were still people
   coming in.

Q. What was stopping him? - A. There were too many people.

Q. It was just too many? - A. Too many, yes.

Q. Did you notice whether people were pushing? - A. People
   were pushing, yes.

Q. Hard, soft? - A. Well, it is the buzz of the football
   match, the buzz that gets people going.  They are
   getting hyperactive because they are not getting in
   early enough.

Q. So there was quite a bit of it, in other words? - A.
   There was quite a bit of pushing outside, yes.

Q. The Officer whom you saw on the horse, was he shouting
   and waving or what was he doing? - A. He was just
   shouting to people, can they stop pushing.  In the end
   he shut the perimeter gates but he couldn't keep them
   closed on his own.  People were trying to still come in
   so he couldn't keep the gates locked on his own.
                                                                   77



                                               L.    F.   CAMPBELL




Q. So he tried to do it but he failed? - A. He tried to do


Q. That was because of pressure from outside? - A. Yes.

Q. You were by this time already on the inside, or were
   you still outside? - A. I was inside.  Still outside
   the turnstiles.

Q. Yes, but on the inside of the perimeter gates? - A. On
   the inside of the perimeter gates, yes.

Q. Did you in the end get through the turnstiles, or ...?
   - A. No, I got carried through the gates.   With all the
   pushing my feet weren't touching the floor and I got
   carried through the gates.

Q. Which gate are we talking about? - A. The gate to the
   right of the turnstiles.

Q. Do you want to show me on the model and then we will be
   able to identify it. Just walk up to it.

         MR. GRIFFITHS:    He is   indicating Gate    C, sir.

Q.     ^ THE CORONER:    Tell me a little bit more about
     this. You can see on the model there is a railing
     there.  Can you remember that from real life? - A. The
     fence at the side, there   is the river going along and
     there is a little fence.    I ended up moving towardsthe
     fence to get out of the crush and then people just come
     from behind me and we got carried through.

Q. So you^tried to escape, if I can use that word, from
   the main crush going into the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

Q. And you took refuge, so to speak, on the bank? -         A.
   Yes.

Q. And then are you saying that a whole crowd came from
   behind you and carried you forward or what? - A. Well,
   someone said the gate was open then everyone just
   started going round towards the gate.

Q. So you could hear a cry, "The gate's open"? - A. I
   could hear someone shout, "The gate's open".

Q. You say you were actually lifted up off your feet? - A.
   Off my feet.

Q. You   are sure about that, are you? - A. Positive,       yes.

Q. Was the gate wide open or only partially open? - A. It
   was wide open because people were pushing it. As it
                                          L.   F.   CAMPBELL




opened ajar people just pushed it open anyway.      That is
when the crowd were going in.

Had you seen it open before or was that the first time
that you had noticed it? - A. That was the first time I
had noticed it.

Having got swept through, so to speak, or carried
through, you finished up inside the concourse area,
didn't you, a biggish area on the inside, that is
right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

You didn't hand in your ticket or anything like that? -
A. No.

Nobody asked you? - A. No, I was waiting for someone to
ask for the ticket.

Having got through that big blue gate, did things
quieten down? Were you able to get your feet back on
the ground? - A. I stopped and I looked round and I
seen the players on the pitch.

How did you see those? Where did you see them? - A. I
looked down the tunnel. I walked down the tunnel,
people were still rushing in, and when I got to the end
of the tunnel I looked round to see which was the
emptiest part, but then I was pushed into the left hand
side of the tunnel.

So you were able to actually walk down the tunnel under
your own steam, so to speak? There may have been a lot
of people around but you weren't being carried? - A. I
wasn t being carried, no.

You got to the exit, if I can use that word, and you
were just surveying the scene, trying to make up your
m m d which way to go, and you say you then got carried?
- A. Pushed down, further down the pen, then I was
         crushed against the barrier so I sort of
lowered myself underneath it, thinking it would be okay
the other side of the barrier, but then everyone seemed
to carry on pushing, people were coming underneath it
anyway.   I got myself into the centre where the
perimeter fence was, and I was standing there next to
Steven Robinson, who unfortunately didn't make it out.
I tried to help him.   He was with a young lad.

Did you know Steven Robinson? - A. No, I didn't know
him at all.

When you first entered the pen - I am just going to
take you back a moment - we know the players were on
                                                               79



                                              L.   F.   CAMPBELL




     the pitch but had play started yet? - A. Play had not
     started, no.

Q. You then say there was a surge from behind you -
   perhaps I should not use the word surge - you were
   carried, I think you said? - A. Yes.

Q. You got how far down the terracing? - A. I was pushed
   three-quarters of the way down.

Q. Were you able to steer yourself at all or was it simplv
   being pushed? - A. Just being pushed.

Q. Did you come to a halt there? I think you said there
   was a barrier at that point? - A. There is.

Q. That is where you stopped initially? - A. Yes.

Q. What was happening on the pitch at that point? - A. I
   can remember the kick-off and then next there were
   people screaming.

Q'          Ee®K!b?r ?hi?h side of the barrier you were when
     the kick-off took place? - A. I was in front of the
     barrier.

Q. You mean you had already ducked underneath it? - A. I
   had already ducked underneath it, yes.




                      /Q. So you hit the barrier
                                                             80


                                               L.   F.   CAMPBELL


Q. So you hit the barrier and you knew it would be safer
   to be on the other side and so you ducked underneath
   and got up. That is when you think the kick-off was?
   - A. Yes.

Q.   What wasit like at kick-off time? - A. Hectic.

Q.    You were there in 1988. Were you in the same pen or
     in the other one? - A. I was in the same one - no, I
     wasn't, sorry.   I couldn't get in there. It was too
     full.  So I went round the side by the stands.

Q. You weren't in the centre last year? - A. I wasn't in
   the centre last year.

Q.   In 1988? - A. 1988.

Q.    So you cannot compare what 1988 was like with 1989
     from your personal experience? - A. Not personal
     experience, n o .

Q. Had you ever been in heavily populated pens before at
   other big matches? - A. I have been to a couple of
   big matches.  It was bad but I didn't think nothing
   of it.

Q. What I am trying to find out is how do they compare
   with what it was like at kick-off? - A. It was
   different. You were getting pushed too much, you
   know.

Q. When you first entered the pen before this, how did
   that compare with other big matches where you had
   been? - A. The other big matches they are all just
   one big pen and so there wasn't the segregation.

Q. Did you know the Leppings Lane terrace was
   segregated? - A. Yes, I did know that.

Q. From the previous year presumably? - A. Yes.

Q. At what point did you become frightened, worried or
   concerned, or whichever word you would like to use? -
   A. When I saw this young lad start screaming for air.
   He had a scarf round his neck and so I tried to tip
   his head in the air to let him get air.  I was
   standing on my tip toes trying to get air myself and
   I just started to get a bit frightened because I
   wasn't getting enough air and so I scrambled my way
   back to the tunnel.

Q. You scrambled back up to the tunnel? - A. Back to the
   tunnel, yes.

Q. The lad that you saw who was obviously very
   distressed that was just around kick-off time after
                                                            81


                                              L.   F.   CAMPBELL


     you had ducked under the barrier? - A. It was just
     slightly before kick-off time.

Q. Had you got from one side of the barrier to the other
   or not? - A. Yes, I was underneath the barrier.

Q. That is when you saw him and that is when you got
   concerned for yourself as well? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you said you tried to help him, did you
   not? - A. I did, yes.

Q. What did you say his name was? - A. Steven Robinson.

Q. How long were you with him before you moved up? - A.
   A couple of minutes.

Q. Had the match finished at that point or not? - A. The
   players had gone off the pitch and that is when I saw
   people being helped over the front perimeter fence.

Q. Were you still with the lad at that point or had you
   already left then? - A. When I seen people getting
   pushed, helped over, I decided to get out. He was
   with his friend so I decided to get myself out of
   there.

Q. He was with somebody? - A. He was with somebody, yes.

Q.   In fact, you had formed the opinion that he had
     stopped breathing anyway? - A. I thought he had,    yes.

Q.    You are not medically qualified but that is just what
     you felt at the time.   So you moved back when you saw
     people climbing over? - A. Yes.

Q. And when the match had finished, is that right? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You got back up to the tunnel, is that right? - A. I
   got back up to the tunnel.

Q. How difficult was it getting back? - A. It was harder
   than when I was going through to the ground in the
   first place because people were still coming in and I
   had to push my way out.

Q. Did you say anything? Did you shout and say that
   people are being hurt or did you hear anybody else? -
   A. I just said, well, I didn't shout anything really.
   I was losing my breath and I just needed fresh air
   and a drink.

Q. I am not criticising you in any way.  I am just
   asking you.  Did you hear anybody else say anything
   in the tunnel? - A. Nobody said anything.

                                            L.   F.   CAMPBELL



Q. In fact, I think you met a few Policemen in the
   tunnel, did you not? - A. Yes, there were a few
   Policemen at the end of the tunnel.

Q. Were they coming down or what were they doing, can
   you remember? - A. I think they were just on their
   way down the tunnel, yes.

Q. Of course, you then left the terraces and you did not
   know what was really going on inside the ground? - A.
   No.

Q. Tell me about 1988 very briefly. What time did you
   get to the ground in 1988? - A. It was about half
   past two or quarter to three.

Q. 2.30 to 2.45, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you go down the tunnel as well initially? - A.
   Yes, I first went down but I couldn't get a good
   view.

Q. Did you get on to the terrace at all? - A. I got to
   the end of the tunnel and I couldn't get a decent
   place to watch the match.

Q. Why was that? - A. Because there were too many people
   in there then.

Q. Was it worse in 1988 than in 1989 when you first
   exited on to the tunnel? - A. When I first looked
   down, y e s .

Q. The impression you formed in 1989 initially was that
   it was marginally better? - A. Yes.

Q. I am not saying much better but it was better than in
   1988? - A. Yes.

Q. In 1988 did you then turn round and come back out of
   the tunnel or what did you do? - A. I turned round
   and come back out of the tunnel and then I went to
   the far left of the ground by the Liverpool
   supporters in the stands.

Q. You watched the match from there? - A. I watched the
   match from there.

Q. In 1989 you say you were still deciding what to do
   when you were picked up and carried in, so to
   speak? - A. Yes.

Q. If that had not happened, can you say whether you
   would have gone in when you were surveying the scene
     or would you have turned round again? - A. I think I
     would have turned round again.

     MR. PAYNE:   It is probably my fault because I was
writing my notes but have we got the time on the acetate.

     THE CORONER:     Oh no, we will do that when you finish.
I am sorry.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. When    you   went down the tunnel in 1989, the disaster,
   were    the players   on the field? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you estimate how long before the kick-off? - A.
   It was about ten minutes before kick-off.

Q. The players were kicking the ball about, were they? -
   A. Kicking the ball about, yes.

Q. When you    decided    to leave the pen and you struggled
   your way back up    to the tunnel this was because you
   had realised there was a very serious crush where you
   were, so bad that it had harmed the boy next to
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. When you were pushing back up through the crowd back
   up towards the tunnel, what were those people
   doing? - A. There were people just coming down the
   tunnel, people who had been outside were coming in
   because they did not know what was going on.

Q. What about the ones who were already on the terrace?
   Did you have to push your way through them to get
   back up to the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. What were they doing when you were pushing your way
   through them? - A. I didn't really notice because I
   was pushing my way through.  I just wanted to get
   air.

Q. You did manage to get your way through the crowd and
   into the tunnel and out? - A. I did, yes.

Q. You are going to show on the acetate which you will
   be asked to mark from what position you started when
   you made that journey out of the pen, do you
   follow? - A. Yes.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Could you walk up to the overhead
     projector and we will show you an acetate and we will
     get you to put a cross on it? What we want you to do
     is to mark the position where you were when you were
     with the lad Steven Robinson? - A. Yes.

       THE CORONER:   That will be 346.
                                                                  84


                                                 L.   F.   CAMPBELL




Q.      MR. PAYNE: When you started that journey from
     where you have marked the paper you said that the
     players had gone off the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you say about how long afterwards it was that you
   decided to get out? - A. Approximately five to ten
   minutes.  I am not sure of the time.

Q. Had all the players gone off or were they still going
   off or what? - A. Players were still going off.

Q. That is probably more accurate then.  Players were
   still leaving the field? - A. Players were still
   leaving the field, yes.

Q. That is when you decided to leave? - A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Campbell, just one point, you come down the
   tunnel. Where do you look into the terraces from?
   Have a look at the acetate? Are you just standing at
   the mouth of the tunnel before you move or you decide
   to go where? - A. Yes, that is where I was standing
   and I was looking round.

Q. Sergeant Griffiths has got his pointer and can you
   tell us where you were standing when you were
   looking, as you told us, to see which was the
   emptiest part? - A. I was standing just to the left
   of the perimeter.

Q. Sergeant Griffiths will move the pointer to wherever
   you want him to move it? - A. To the right.

Q. So what would be your left? - A. Yes.

Q.    About there? -   A. Yes, that is about right.

Q.    So the pushing that came, came from people who       were
      still in the tunnel? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, can I just stop you? Can
we identify that position in words? It is between the exit
of the tunnel and halfway down the little brick wall, is it
not?

     MR. ISAACS:       Yes, on the acetate, sir, possibly
adjacent to three       lines down.

        THE CORONER:    Why   does he not put a little circle on
it?

       MR. ISAACS:     He could, sir, yes.
                                                            85

Q.        THE CORONER:   Go and draw us a circle on it
     please? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. ISAACS:   That, Mr. Campbell, would have
     given you no opportunity to look round the terracing
     to find a suitable spot for you to stand in? - A. Not
     really, no, just got shoved.

Q. Just shoved in the back? - A. Yes.

Q. At quite some speed, some force? - A. Some force,
   yes.

Q. As if whoever was behind you was in a hurry? - A.
   Yes.

               Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Q. I want to go back in time.    I have been having a look at
   the evidence given by that Liverpool police officer, the
   mounted officer you recognised from Anfield.     I want to
   read you something and see whether you agree because you
   talked, and let me just remind you of the sort of words
   you used, "People were pushing.    The buzz just gets
   people going.    They get hyperactive because they could
   not get in.    Those were the sort of things you were
   saying.   This is what the officer said, "The crowd just
   lost it on that day.    They had this obsession with
   getting in and if they won t work with you, you can't
   work with them."     He was talking there about trying to
   stop people pushing forward.    Do you agree with that
   sort of observation of the officer?    Is that similar to
   what you were trying to telling us in perhaps rather more
   modern words? - A. Hell, similar, but he should have had
   more back-up.

Q. He should have had more back-up? - A. Yes.

Q. You were saying that you were quite clear there was no
   doubt in your mind that people were pushing?   That it
   was quite clear to you that the officer was trying to
   stop people pushing and that the people were not taking
   any notice of that? - A. That's right, yes.

Q. The other thing is when you had actually gone on to the
   terrace by the fierce shove from behind that you have
   just told my learned friend Mr. Isaacs, when you went on
   to the terrace you didn't find it then all that difficult
   to get through and take up a position at t hat ti me ?
   When you first got in? - A. When I first got in.

Q. That was similar to, it is obviously a different place,
   but similar to crowds on terraces that you have
   experienced personally at big matches at that time? - A.
   Yes.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KIRG:

Q. You yourself at all times were being carried into the
   ground? - A. Yes.

Q. You yourself had no choice about it, you were carried
   along with the crowd? - A. Yes, that's right.

Q. Here there people ahead of you?   You weren't at the
   front of the crowd? - A. I wasn't at the front of the
   crowd.

Q. Unwillingly, perhaps, you would be exerting pressure on
   the people in front of you? - A. I had no option.
                                                              87

                                                L.    F.   CAMPBELL


Q. Of course you didn't.    I ana with you. You had no
   option.   The people in front of you had no option.   The
   person in front of you would have said, if asked, "That
   lad behind is pushing me," meaning you, but you would not
   have been, would you, because you were being carried
   along?   That's right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. The crowd, people in the crowd where you were, had no
   choice.   They were just moving and being moved? - A.
   That's right, yes.

              Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Campbell, can you remember what time you      went down
   the tunnel in 1988? -A. It was about twenty       to quarter
   to three.

Q. You found it very crowded at that time? - A. At that
   time, yes.

Q. Although you noticed the pens were very crowded in the
   centre, did you have any difficulty in going back up the
   tunnel? - A. No, not in 1988.

Q. People weren't still pouring into that centre area that
   year, were they? - A. I think the majority were in at
   that time.

Q. When you came back up the tunnel you had decided for
   yourself that the area was full.   Did you notice whether
   there were any police officers, after you had come out,
   telling other fans that it was full in that area? - A. I
   didn't notice anything.   I just went and got myself some
   air and a drink.

Q. I'm sorry, I'm going back to 1988 now. - A. I'm sorry.

Q. When you came back up the tunnel that year and you made
   your way out of it, did you notice any police officers
   going to the mouth of the tunnel and preventing other
   people going down there? - A. They stood at the mouth of
   the tunnel the year before.

                      Bv THE CORONER;

Q. I just want to be quite sure that I have understood your
   answers to Mrs. McBrien.   Nineteen eighty-eight we are
   talking about? - A. Yes.

Q. Not 1989, 1988.   You went down the tunnel initially.
   Did anybody try and stop you at that point? — A. Nobody
   tried to stop me, no.
                                                             88

Q. You then decided you didn't like it and came back up? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Anybody try and stop you going out? - A. No.

Q. Police officers, I mean? - A. No.

Q. Did you at that point see police officers stopping people
   going down the tunnel or telling you not to go? - A. I
   d i d n t see them stopping people but I saw them standing.
   There were two or three police officers standing at the
   mouth of the tunnel.

Q. You didn't see what they were doing? - A. I didn't see
   what they were doing.

Q. Did you know there was a stairwell going upstairs to the
   stand near there? - A. Yes.

Q. Here they on that side or the other side? - A. They were
   standing by that tunnel that goes up.

Q. You mean the staircase? - A. The staircase, yes.

Q. You are not saying they were standing at the mouth of the
   tunnel leading to the terrace, or are you? - A. There
   were two police officers standing at the mouth of the
   tunnel...

Q. Going to the terracing? - A. Yes, and there was one
   police officer with a steward standing by the staircase.

Q. The two chaps who were by the mouth of the tunnel, they
   didn't speak to you, as such? - A. No.

Q. You didn't hear them speak to anybody else? - A. No, I
   didn't.

Q. So you don't actually knov what they were doing there
   except that they were there? - A. Just through there,
   yes.

Q. In 1989 you didn't see anybody there? - A. No.

        THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, do you want to have
   another go?   Have you understood what he has said?

        MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes, thank you.

   people in front of me.

                                           D . A . RICHARDS


Here you being pushed towards the turnstiles when you
were still outside the perimeter gates, or had you^
already got through them, so to speak? - A. No, still
outside.

Just outside? - A. Yes.

This movement was coming from behind you, was it? - A.
Yes.

Has it a proper push, if I can use that expression, or
what was it? - A. Just like a normal build up of the
crowd.

Nothing extraordinary?   As far as you were concerned
just a crowd moving forward? - A. Yes.

You weren't being forced along? - A. No.

Did you see any police officers? - A. I saw two mounted
police officers.

Hhere were they? - A. They were in front of the gates.

Across the gates? - A. Yes.

Broadways on? - A. Yes.

Did you form any opinion as to what they were trying to
do? - A. I think they were just trying to stop us from
going in towards the turnstile area.

You understood that? - A. Yes.

How close were you before you realised th§t that is what
they were trying to do? — A. About three feet away from
the gates themselves.

How close to the officers? - A. About three feet.

At that point, if you had wanted to could you have^
stopped your forward movement and stepped to one side? -
A. Possible, yes.

You could have done? - A. Possible.

What does "possible" mean?   Does it mean yes or no?      It
would have been possible? - A. Yes.

The other people who were with you, would it have been
possible for them as well, or not? - A. I am not quite
sure on that.

But you yourself could have moved to one side? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact you didn't, you carried on? - A. Yes.

Q. You then go through the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Q. How many did you see?   Did you say two or three

Q. You got through the perimeter gates.    Were they open
   when you went through? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then make your way towards the turnstile? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you get through a turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you distressed in the area between the perimeter
   gate and the turnstile? - A. Yes, very distressed.

Q. Because of what? - A. Because of the crowd that were
   filling up behind you and pushing you forwards to the
   turnstiles themselves.

Q. You felt that you were being crushed in fact? - A. No,
   not crushed, just pushed along.

Q. Pushed along? - A. Yes.

Q. I beg your pardon.  Now was the pushing there any
   different to the pushing, not to the pushing, to the
   movement which you have described outside the perimeter
   gate? - A. A bit more heavier.

Q. It was heavier? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you in control of your movements at that point?
   - A. Just about.

Q. You weren't being carried along? - A. Slightly.     I could
   move my hands and my arms and my legs.

Q. But you were being steered by the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. You actually got through the turnstile? ~ A. Yes.

Q. You had seen a couple of Officers up on the top, hadn't
   you? - A. Yes, I had seen an Officer.

Q. An Officer or more? - A. Just shouting people to push
   back a bit.

Q. Push back, did you say? - A. Yes.

Q. He was on top of the turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see an Officer anywhere else shouting and
   indicating apart from the mounted Officers? - A. No.

Q. Having got through this turnstile, you were in a larger
   area weren't you again? - A. Yes.

Q. And things were a bit easier in there, weren't they?
   - A. Yes.

q . Perhaps you could just tell me this:    what happened
   then, you waited I think? -    A. Well I waited to see if
   I could see any of my mates    because I had got split
   up from them, but I waited     about three or    four minutes
   and I could   not see any of   them so I went    on intothe
   tunnel.

Q. Do you know   what time that was about? - A. 2.50.

Q. Did you see  any of the big gates     open? - A. Yes, the
   concertina gate was open.

Q. It was open? - A. Yes, when I got in.

Q. And people I take it were coming through? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it wide open? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you want to go behind the goal, is that where you
   like to stand? - A. No, well the year before as I said
   I was up on the left-hand side and I thought well I
   would see how bad it was.  I went down towards the
   tunnel end and just went through it to see whether I could
   get out to that side again but I forgot that you could
   not get out that side.

Q. I am having a little bit of difficulty hearing you.
   Forgive me. You say in 1988 you had been down there?
   - A. I went to the left-hand side as you look out on to
   the pitch, the left-hand side to the bank.

Q. So this year you decided you would go down the centre
   because you wanted to see what it was like down there?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know that the terracing was divided by these
   fences. Had you noticed that in 1988? - A. No, I didn't.

Q. You had not noticed it? - A. No.

Q. So you did not know when you went down? - A. I did not
   know them.

Q. Down the 'tunnel you go, is it crowded or not? - A. No,
   it was a steady flow of people going down.

         THE CORONER:   All right, Mr. Manning, am I going
   too fast?

         MR. MANNING:   Well you have actually got another

  gear up this afternoon sir with this last witness, but
  I had thought that he had said that he had forgotten
  he could not get through that way and that was what
  was puzzling to me when you put to him that he did not
  know the terrace was divided up.

        THE CORONER:    Yes, I will go over that again.
  Thank you.

Q. Mr. Manning has reminded me that when you first mentioned
   going down the tunnel you said you had forgotten you
   could not go through. What did you mean by that? - A.
   I forgot, I thought you could get all the way along
   but when I went to go over you just could not get over
   that way towards the left.

Q. When you said you "forgot" do you mean to say you did
   not know or that you had forgot that you had realised
   that there were radial fences in 1988 but then had
   forgotten about them when you went down? - A. No, I
   didn't know.  I thought as usual you could get all the
   way along the terraces.

Q. So you go down the tunnel, it is not too bad as I can
   understand it. Did you look before you went down the
   tunnel? - A. No.

Q. So you don't know what was going on on the pitch? - A.
   I knew the players were on the pitch.

Q. And  when you got to the exit of the tunnel, you know
   theother end of it, do you know which side you went
   left or right? - A. I went to the right.

Q. What was the terrace like when you first got out? -
   A. When I first got through the tunnel it was not too
   bad but I stood about two minutes or so and then people
   realised the kick-off would be coming shortly as the
   players were on the pitch and all that they decided to
   go down the tunnel and then it got worse and worse,
   you just got carried forward.

Q. Initially it   was not too bad? - A. No.

Q. Did  you stay up at the back or did you move forward?
   - A. I moved forward.

Q. And you were able to make your own way at that stage?
   - A. Well I started to get carried down towards the
   front.

Q. But you were still able to guide yourself? - A. Yes.

Q. I am talking about in the beginning, I am not talking
   about what happened later. Then you say after a couple
   of minutes more people started to come in? - A. Yes.

                                      P ..A .   RICHARDS




Q. Was it then when you started getting carried forward?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Had play kicked off by then yet or were they still
   kicking around? - A. No, just kicked off by then.

Q. Would it be right to say that you felt the big build up
   or the build up as kick-off occurred or is it unfair?
   - A. About right, just started as people realised the
   kick-off was coming up to, they just decided to go in
   to see the match if it had started.

Q. At that point were you apprehensive, were you worried
   about your own situation? - A. No.

Q. At kick-off point? - A. No.     No, I believe it was okay.

Q. You saw a couple of your friends, I think, Carl Lewis
   and Steven Roberts, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Q. They were in the same ....     A. Yes, as I thought.

Q. At what point did you see them? - A. It was after the
   kick-off.

Q.    Were they at the front of you, at the sideof you,
     behind you, where were they? - A. To thefront of      me
     to the left.

Q. This was after kick-off I think you said? - A. Yes.

Q. What did they look like? - A. Well I just saw the faces
   of them, a side view of them and they looked not too
   bad to me.

Q.   Not too bad? - A. Not too bad.

Q.   Did you see their faces again? - A. No.

Q. I want to be sure that we have got this right.   I don't
   mind which way you answer I just want to get it as right
   as we can.   In your statement, you know when you wrote
   this, you said you saw them, you know Carl and Steven
   and you says

           "They were both facing the front.  I could
           only see their heads and faces and they
           were obviously in distress and pain as they
           were shouting".

     A. Yes.

Q. Now I want to know, you just told me that they weren't
   too bad. Can you try and reconcile those two answers
   because this sounds as if they were .... A. They were
   distressed but not too bad.
                                                             97

                                     D.A.   RICHARDS




Q. I see, so they were distressed but you did not think
   it was that bad at that stage. That is what you are
   trying to say? - A. Yes.

Q. You weren't worried for their life at that stage? - A.
   No.

Q. They didn't look to you at that point as if they were
   in imminent danger? - A. No.

Q. You could not I presume hear them shout, could you?
   - A. No.

Q. So you don't know what they were shouting? - A. No.

Q. You just saw their mouths move? - A. As I thought,
   yes.

Q. Were the people around you cheering and chanting as
   far as you remember at this time? - A. Not that I can
   remember, no.

Q. Were the people saying anything around you that you
   can remember? - A. People were shouting out, myself
   included, just to tell people to get back.

Q. Telling people to get back? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you notice whether anybody took any notice of that?
   - A. I don't know.

Q. You didn't feel any difference anyway? - A. No.

Q. At one point or other you fell didn't you, you fell to
   your knees? - A. Yes.

Q.    When was that, after you had seenCarl? - A. Yes, after
     I had seen Carl and Steven I went down on to the floor
     myself.   I didn't see them again after that.

Q. Were you able to stand up? - A. Eventually, yes.

Q. When you say "eventually" how long, minutes? - A.
   15 seconds.

Q.   Oh I see, not very long? - A. No.

Q.   So you managed to get just enough room   to stand up?
     - A. Yes.

Q. Did it then get any worse as far as you yourself were
   concerned? - A. Slightly worse, yes.

Q. Did you become apprehensive for your own condition at
   any point? - A. Yes.

Q. When was that? - A. More or less when I went down on to
   the floor.

Q. Do you remember - because play was already in being because
   you have told me that - do you recollect Beardsley hitting
   the cross bar? - A. No.

Q.   Did you feel any big surges at all? - A. No.

Q.   Was it a steady build up of pressure as far as you were
     concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. Not a pulse thing, not a surge, just a steady ....     A. Just
   a steady build up.

Q. You also I think saw people climbing over the front fence.
   Do you remember? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can you remember when you first saw anybody climbing over
     the fence? - A. Well just after the kick-off.  About
     five minutes after the kick-off the gate got opened and
     people started ....

Q. Let me just help you a little bit because times are so
   difficult.   People say five minutes but five minutes is
   an awful long time. The game only lasted six minutes,
   or at least just over five minutes actually, so are you
   saying the gate was not opened until the game finished?
   - A. Yes, the gate was opened, then it got closed again
   by the Police Officers themselves and they were putting
   you back in.

Q. Just try and tell me as accurately as you can about what
   you saw with regard to the gate. All right?  - A. Yes.

Q. Start with when you saw Carl.  You saw Carl. Did you
   by any chance notice the gate at that time? When I say
   "Carl" I mean Carl and Steven, both of them? - A. I saw
   the gate slightly to the right of me.

Q. At that point was it open or shut? - A. It was shut.

Q. Then you fell and you got up after about 15 seconds.
   The game was still in play? - A. Yes.

Q. Was the gate open or shut? - A. Still shut.

Q. Were people climbing over the fence by then? - A. They
   were trying to get over the fence, yes.

Q. You remember, you are sure? - A. Yes.

Q. Don't say five minutes, think before you answer.  Can
   you estimate how long it was from that point that you
   saw the gate open? - A. About two minutes.

                                   D.A.   RICHARDS




Q. And then how long was it open before you saw it shut?
   - A. A couple of seconds then it got slammed shut by
   the Police and locked by the bolts.

Q. Could you see that from where you were? - A. Yes.




                      Q. Did anybody
                                                                  100

Q. Did anybody get out that first time? - A. M
   I know.                                   Not as far as

Q. You did not see anybody ? - A. No.

Q. Then you say it was shut after a few seconds? - A. Yes.

Q. Then how long after that was it opened again, if at
   all?  If you didn't see it don't tell me. - A.
   Approximately another three minutes or so.

Q. So it was shut for three minutes you say? - A. Yes.

Q. Was the game still in play then or had it finished? -
   A. The game had just finished, just been stopped.

Q. Was the gate shut when the game had finished? - A. Yes.

Q. It was definitely shut when the game was finished? You
   are quite sure, because we can check all this because
   we have got videos. - A. I think it was still shut.

Q. What I am trying to find out is the truth, you see, as
   far as you can, so I don't want to catch you out by
   making you tell me things which aren't right. - A. Yes.

Q. On the other hand I want you to tell me what you
   remember, not what we can see on the video.  That is up
   to us. You went back up out of the tunnel, didn't you?
   - A. Eventually, yes.

Q. Can you show me on a plan - go up to that overhead.
   (pie witness marked his position on Exhibit C347) Is
   that the position vou were at when vou could see the
   gate opening and shutting? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that where you remained the whole time or did you go
   further forward at all? - A. That is where I remained
   the whole time.

Q. So you did not advance down towards the front at all? -
   A. No.

Q. It is quite a long way - I am sure you could   see the
   gate, what surprises me a little bit is that   you say
   you could see it being locked. What did you    actually
   see? - A. I just seen a Police Officer, as I   thought,
   putting the bolt across.

               Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Mr. Richards, outside the ground where the two mounted
   Police were across the gates trying to stop people from
   going into the turnstile area. - A. Yes, there was.
                                            D.   A.   RICHARDS




I am just drawing your attention to that place which
you have told us about, when you could have stopped
your forward movement why did you not do so? - A. I
just wanted to go in and watch the match and just
carried on going forward.  I could have made my way
back out if I wanted to, but I didn't want to, I wanted
to go in and watch the match.

You could have stopped at that time? - A. Yes.

Can you just roll up how much drink you had had by that
stage at the various places you had stopped? - A. We
only stopped at the one public house and that was just
outside Barnsley, and I got four drinks, that's all.

Four what, is that? - A. Four drinks, pernod and
lemonade.

I don't quite know whether we have got this or not -
are you an experienced football supporter? - A. Well, I
have been going to football matches now for years.

For years? - A. Yes.

So you have been in other football crushes? - A. Yes.

You told the Coroner that you were not worried about
your own situation at the time of kick-off? - A. No, I
wasn't worried.

You were not worried? - A. No.

Is that because the crush at that time was similar to
other crushes that you had been in? - A. Yes.

Whereabouts were you then?  Is that where you have
marked it or somewhere else? - A. No, as you come in
through the tunnel, we came down and stopped about four
feet away from where we ended up, and then just carried
on.

Could you point to whereabouts you were at the time of
kick-off?

     MR. PAYNE:   For the shorthand note, he has
pointed to a place a short distance inside the pen, at
the entrance to the tunnel and slightly to the right,
about level with the first railing.

     THE CORONER:      Barrier, I think we had better say,
if you don't mind.

     MR. PAYNE:   The other point which has attracted
interest is that from the place where you have marked

     the plan, from that position, you were able to see the
     Policeman bolting the gate? - A. As I thought, yes.

Q. This is helpful to indicate the kind of view that you
   had.  You see, if you were able to see that then you
   were able to see all the crowd between where you were
   and the bolting of the gate? - A. Yes.

Q. By looking down over their heads? - A. More or less,
   yes.

Q. Or through their heads, in between their heads? - A. In
   between them, yes.

Q. There is a photograph which gives quite a good idea of
   the kind of view that you would have had from the
   position that you were on the terrace.

          MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I wonder if  I might just break
     off and then when other questions have been asked, by
     that time perhaps there might be a photograph which we
     can show the Court.

          THE CORONER:   Can you deal with 1988 while   we get
     that photograph, or did you want to carry on?Sergeant
     Griffiths, can you take it and see whether we can get
     one done?

          MR. PAYNE:   Sir, were you inviting me to deal
     with his experience in 1988?

          THE   CORONER:     If you would,    yes.

Q«       MR. PAYNE:        Whereabouts were   you? - A. In '88?

Q.   Yes. - A. On the left hand side as       you look out onto
     the pitch.

Q. To the left? - A. Yes, at the bank on the left hand
   side.

Q. I will ask you to look at the big map we have got.  In
   that folder you have got you will find some photographs
   - 274 - if you look at the left hand end of the ground
   do you see West Stand marked? -, A. Yes.

Q. And in front of     that there is the terracing? - A.Yes.

Q. Can you show whereabouts you were, please, in 1988? -
   A. You have got more or less the corner flag,left  hand
   corner flag, in that area in '88.

Q. Is that more or less where the numbers 6 and 7 are? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Right down at that far end? - A. Yes.

          MR. PAYNE:     Sir, I don't ask any more questions
     about that.

          THE CORONER:     Do you want to come back when we
     get the acetate?

          MR. PAYNE:     Yes.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Q. Mr. Richards, you set off and arrive in Sheffield at
   about 2.15? - A. Yes.

Q. But you get to the public house in Barnsley at about
   half-past-2? - A. No, 12.30.

Q.   I do apologise - I can't read my own note.        Had you
     arranged to stop off there? - A. Yes.

Q. Somewhere where you knew you were going to be? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   Had you done the same the year before? - A. Yes.

Q.   You had arranged the coach? - A. No, we went down         by
     minibus the year before.

Q. You had gone by minibus? - A. Yes.

Q. So this time you had over 40 of you in this coach? - A.
   Yes.

Q.    Had you reckoned to leave as late as 1.45 from
     Barnsley? - A. Well, it was about half an hour's drive,
     as we thought to get in  - about half one, 1.45.

Q.    You told us you left at 1.45.  Didn't you thinkyou
     were cutting it a little bit fine to get to the game? -
     A. No.

Q. You didn't? - A, No, because the year before we had no
   trouble with traffic.

Q. But this time there were over 40 of you? - A. Yes.

Q. You were dropped off very close to the ground? - A.
   Yes.

Q. How far away then from the Leppings Lane turnstiles
   were you dropped off by the coach? - A. About a ten
   minute walk.
                                                                       104

Q. Did you all walk down together? - A. More or less, yes.

Q. So am I right in assuming this, that when you have told
   us that you saw the Police Officer on the horse - in
   fact, there were two Police Officers that you tell us
   about? - A. Yes.

Q. You were with your mates then? - A. I had been split up
   from a couple of them.

Q. You had been split up from a couple of them but the
   greater number of the lads who had been with you on
   that coach were with you or near you at that time? -           A.
   Some of us had stand tickets and some of us had the
   terracing tickets.

Q.   Yes, but you would    all be going through the Leppings
     Lane turnstiles? -   A. Yes.

Q. So there may have been 35, 40 of you all at that time
   all wanting to get into the ground? - A. Maybe, I don't
   know.

Q.    Where were they if they weren't near you? - A. As      we
     were walking down we just split up to go to our
     different destinations.

Q.   Two or three of you, you lost sight of? - A. Yes.

Q.   But the rest ofyou were just about together? - A. Yes,
     round about together.

Q. All going towards the Leppings Lane turnstiles? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And all like you wanting to get in for the kick-off? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You, as you told Mr. Payne, kept going because you
   wanted to get in? - A. Yes.

Q.   You got into this area between the perimeter gates        and
     the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. You managed to get through a turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q.   You were aiming towards the turnstile? - A. Yes.

Q.   And your mates were still with you? - A. No, I lost
     them by then.

Q. You all split up then? - A. Yes, I had lost all my
   mates.
                                                                     105



                                                D.   A.   RICHARDS




Q. But they had been with you by and large, the greater
   number of them, when you saw the Police Officer? - A.
   Yes.

Q. As you went into the crowd that was in front of the
   turnstiles you managed to get through that crowd and
   get actually through it and into the concourse? - A.
   Yes.

Q. That was because, as you told Mr. Payne, you wanted to
   get in and see the kick-off? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

Q. Just following that through, you said that after you
   got through the perimeter gates you were a bit
   distressed because of the crowd pushing along towards
   the turnstiles? - A. Slightly, yes.

Q. Those Police Officers on the horses had tried to stop
   the crowd going past the perimeter gates and into the
   turnstile area so that it would not get too full and
   people would not get distressed in there? - A. They
   tried to but the year before we had Police by the
   turnstiles organising queues.  This year we didn't have
   nothing.

Q« The two Police Officers on the Police horses were there
   trying to stop people going into the turnstile area? -
   A. Trying to, yes.

Q. And as you have fairly said, and it is proper that you
   should give your evidence truthfully, you could have
   stopped but you chose not to do so? - A. Yes.

Q. So you were one of the people who then went through
   into the other area and filled it up? - A. Yes.

Q.    When you were on the terrace itself you have described,
     and I don't need to trouble you again, about your
     feelings that things were acceptable, they were the
     sort of crush that you had experienced before, and that
     you became apprehensive when you fell down? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that apprehension because you were worried whether
   you would be able to get up again? - A. Yes.

Q.   Having got up again did that remove the apprehension
     you then felt? - A. No,I had seen people in distress.

Q. You saw other people in distress? - A. Yes.

Q. But you yourself had removed the reason for your own
   apprehension, namely getting up? - A. Partly, yes.
                                           D.   A.   RICHARDS




Your feeling was that the people that then came in,
they were rushing in for kick-off time or as close to
kick-off time as they could? - A. Well, not rushing in
but trying to get   in to get a good viewing point.

     THE CORONER:   Mr.    King, before you start shall we
let Mr. Payne deal with    his photograph? What "C"
number is this?

     MR. JONES;    C348, sir. Can I have    a reference on
the photograph?

     MR. PAYNE:   It is number 23.




       /THE CORONER:      Mr. Payne,
                                                           107

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, I keep on interrupting you,
and do please forgive me. We have got another witness whom
I am very anxious we should hear.  I do not think he will
take that long. Will it be all right if we just overshoot
a little today? Thank you. That is not to rush you in any
way.

            Further Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. Just glance at the photograph, would you? The
   position you have marked on the diagram puts you a
   bit over to the right and in this photograph we are
   only just coming out of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Griffiths is pointing at the place where I think
   you have marked it on the plan? - A. Yes.

Q. From that position, can you see the gate as shown in
   the photograph? - A. Yes, directly more or less in
   front of me.

Q. If Sergeant Griffiths puts his pointer more or less
   on the point where the bolt is halfway down, that is
   it? - A. Yes.

Q. You are saying that from where you were, you were
   actually able to see that part of the gate? - A. As
   far as I could make out, yes.

Q. Therefore, it follows from that that you were then
   able to see everything that was happening in front of
   you? - A. More or less, yes.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. KI N G :

Q. Would you tell us in your own words what it was you
   saw which led you to come to say to us that the
   Police were pushing people back in? What was it you
   saw? - A. I just seen the gate opening about 15
   seconds, something like that and the Police were just
   pushing them back in. People were trying to get out.

Q. People were trying to get out? - A. Yes.

Q. What were the Police doing? - A. They just pushed
   them back in and then shut the gate.

Q. How long had the game been going on at that stage,
   can you help us, if at all? Had the game started by
   then? - A. Yes.   The game had been going on about
   two or three minutes.

Q. I want to also ask you about what you mean by a
   certain phrase.  You said when you first got through
   the tunnel that it was not too bad. That was your
   opinion.  You also used that expression a bit later
                                                         108



                                                D.A.   RICHARDS


     when you were talking about your friends and you had
     seen their faces and you also said that they were not
     too bad. You used that same expression? - A. Yes.

       MR. KING:   Sir, this is my fault.  You very
properly read out part of his statement and I wonder if you
might remind me just of the part you read out, sir?

     THE CORONER:      Yes, I thought I ought to deal with
that.

       MR. KING:    Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:   What he said was, and he was talking
about Carl Lewis and Steven Robinson, "They were both
facing the front.  I could only see their heads and faces.
They were obviously in distress and pain as they were
shouting".

Q.      MR. KING:  First of all, Mr. Richards, you heard
     the learned Coroner read out that part of your
     statement? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that accurate what you put in your statement?      Is
   that true? - A. Yes.

Q. So you saw that your two friends were obviously in
   distress and pain? - A. At a certain point, yes, as I
   thought.

Q. You also when telling us about it said that at the
   same time you regarded that - because it is the use
   of the words, you see - as not too bad? - A. Well, to
   a certain point, yes.

        MR. ISAACS:    I am sorry, sir, he did not actually say
that. What actually happened was that he said at first,
when he was not being led by you, with respect, "I saw my
two friends.     They didn't appear too bad".   It may be that
he could not recollect what in fact he had said so long ago
and what the actual position was but then you, sir,
reminded him about what was in his statement.      There then
followed, if I may say so, your attempt to reconcile the
irreconcilable, in which case he then said, "Well, they
were distressed but I wasn't worried for their lives". He
never actually said, "When I said originally that they
didn't appear to be too bad I meant by that" - just as my
learned friend has said - "I meant by that that they were
in pain and crying out but I didn't consider that to be too
b a d ". It appears that he then remembered what he had
originally said which was to the effect of what was in the
statement and moved on from saying that they did not appear
to be too bad.      He corrected himself effectively.

     MR. KING:  I sun sure Mr. Isaacs can give evidence
about what this witness believes if he so wishes.   I have
no further questions, sir.

     THE CORONER:     Mr. King, please feel free to go over
the ground again.

     MR. KING:  Sir, the point has been made. My learned
friend chose to intervene at that point.  So be it. I have
no further questions.

                Cross-Examined bv MISS ADDLEMAN:

Q. You have mentioned that you saw the gate being
   opened? - A. Yes.

Q. And the Police pushing people back in? - A. Yes.

Q. What I would like to say you about is this;
   presumably from what you could see at the gate or
   what your view was of the people was the back of
   their heads? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree you could not see exactly what they were
   doing? - A. Yes, I couldn't see exactly what they
   were doing.

Q. You could not see exactly what they were doing? - A.
   Yes, I could not see exactly what they were doing.

Q. I do not suppose you could tell us exactly how many
   people were around the width of the gate? - A. No, I
   couldn't say.

Q . Would you agree with me that it would   be an awful
    lot? - A. A fair few people,   yes.

Q.   A fair few people? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you say you could see the Policeman's hands? - A.
     No, I didn't say that at all. Just that I had seen
     the gates getting locked by a Police Officer as I
     thought.

Q. As you thought? - A. Yes.

Q. That is what I would like to ask you about because
   that implies you did not actually seen it but you
   thought it? - A. I had seen the gates getting shut
   over again and, as I thought, the bolt getting put
   on.

Q. You are not sure about that? - A. Well, as sure as I
   can b e .

Q. Something is making you doubt? - A. Not really, no.

Q. As you thought, I just wondered why you used that
   expression? - A. As I thought the gate was getting
   locked by a Police Officer.

                    Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. I just want to go over this once more. We have
   almost finished or at least I have almost finished.
   Could you see any movement to indicate that a bolt
   was being closed? - A. I just seen like a Police
   Officer towards and by the gate when the gate got
   pushed open and then realised the gate was open and
   people were trying to get out and pushing them back
   in and closed the gate again.

Q. That I can understand. I have got no problems with
   that. You go on to say that you saw him bolt the
   gate? - A. Yes.

Q. There is a difference between shutting a gate or
   locking it, is there not? - A. Yes.

Q. You would agree with that? - A. Yes.

Q. So there is a difference between shutting a gate and
   bolting it? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it that you saw which made you say, "He has
   shut it", that is easy, you saw him do it? - A. Yes.

Q. And "He bolted it". What did you see which made you
   say that? That is all I am interested in? - A. I
   seen his hand going towards, as I think, was the
   lock, the bolt itself.

Q. Were you able to see a bolt at all? - A. No, I wasn't
   able to see a bolt.

Q.    Did you see the hand move in any way or did you just
     see it approach that bolt? - A. Approach the bolt.

Q. You did not see it move? - A. No.

Q. You do not know what type of bolt it is? - A. No.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, I am conscious of the passage of
time and I have been trying to reconcile his evidence and
sequence of events with the photographs.   There is a clear
photograph at 2.59 which was exhibited to the Taylor
Report.  I think I can say that without offence.

     THE CORONER:     We   have got that as an exhibit
actually.

                                             D. A. RICHARDS


     MR. PAYNE:   It shows the gate was opened at 2.59
which was at or about the time of kick-off.  That is the
reason for the activity here.

     THE CORONER:   If you look at Exhibit 326, that is it,
is it not?

      MR. PAYNE:   Unfortunately, sir, it has not come out
very well on the screen.

     THE CORONER:    It is a little better on here.

     MR. PAYNE:  It is clear in the Taylor photographs that
in the 2.59 photograph you can see that Gate 3 is open.
There is no doubt about it.

     THE CORONER:   That is the problem it is not easy to
see in this photograph but you can see it on the acetate.

     MR. PAYNE:   In your chronology at 277 in your bundle
you have got the timings at 14:59:20 and that is probably
apparent from the photograph.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, that is right.

Q. What we are trying to do, Mr. Richards, is piece
   together bits and pieces and what Mr. Payne is now
   talking about is that there is photographic evidence
   to show the gate was opened at kick-off time
   basically? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not see that? - A. No.

Q. That does not mean it was not opened? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not see it? - A. No.

Q. You remember seeing the gate opened at some later
   time? - A. Yes.

Q. You also seem to remember that it was closed later
   than that? - A. Yes.

Q. I do not think you remember it opening again, do you?
   - A. Yes, later on just after the game had been
   stopped.

Q. Did you see it opening or did you see it open? - A.
   Open.

Q. It was already opened? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:   Is there anything else?   Now, ladies
and gentlemen, I am very keen to have the next witness
called.  Do you want me to pause for a few minutes or do
you want me to press on?

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Before the witness goes I think Mrs.
McBrien has been trying to catch your attention, sir.

       THE CORONER:   Yes, Mrs. McBrien.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   I did just want to ask something
please and it is about the opening at 2.59, not to this
witness but to you actually with you asking the witness I
was wondering if I could ask the witness a question.

       THE CORONER:   What is it you want to ask?

     MRS. McBRIEN:   I was just wondering low long the gate
was left open when it was opened at 2.59?

     THE CORONER:   That is a difficult question which the
witness cannot answer and which I think we may get some
evidence on or not.  It is a very difficult problem that
and I do not think this witness can help. All I can tell
you is that there are this series of photographs which Mr.
King very kindly drew to our attention at two minute
intervals which shows the gate open.   What happened in
between we do not know, not from the photographs.

     MR. KING:   Sir, there is a grave danger, as you have
reminded me on occasion, using a photograph which is a
snapshot in time which is before and after.

       THE CORONER:   I agree.

     MR. KING:   I am not going to read anything out, to
the Jury or otherwise, but can I ask you to look at
paragraph 72, the first sentence?

       THE CORONER:   Which paragraph?

       MR. KING:    Of the Taylor Report, sir, because that
ties    in with the photograph and that is why I say it.

     THE CORONER:   I am quite aware that merely because it
was open at 14.59, it may well have been open at this time.
I was going to tell you this, ladies and gentlemen, in my
summing up.  It may well have been open at this time but
that does not mean to say it was not shut and re-opened and
re-shut and re-opened. We will see what we learn as we go
along. All we are saying is that this witness saw it open
and shut. We have been probing about the bolt because that
is an important thing because it is a long way away.  It
does not mean to say that just because there is a
photograph at 14.59 it is right. We will sort that out as
we go along.  That is right, is it not?

     MR. KING:    I am sorry, sir, I did   not hear what you
said.

                                             D. A. RICHARDS


     THE CORONER:   I was saying to the Jury that just
because there is a photograph at 14.59 does not mean to say
it was not shut and re-opened later after that.   It may
have happened a hundred times for all I know.   On the
photographs what we are trying to do is piece together what
the witness can remember and we are trying to help them not
to say things - I am trying to help them - totally out of
sequence with photographic or video evidence because you
want to try and help them as timing is so difficult.   In
the end it is what the witness says.

        MR. KING:   I think the point is a simple one.   the
   witness could be right and the photograph could be right.

        MR. PAYNE:   I aim sorry to prolong this.  Mr. King
   has asked you to look at the Taylor Report at a
   particular paragraph.

        THE CORONER:      I will look at it but I am not
   looking at it now.

        MR. PAYNE:       I appreciate that.  He has asked you
   to do this.   I     ask you please to look at it as well at
   paragraph 81.

        THE CORONER:       Which was your paragraph, Mr. King?

        MR. KING:Seventy-two, sir.

        THE CORONER:   Seventy-two and eighty-one. We will
   make a note of that but I am not looking at it now.

        MR. PAYNE:      Anyway, it is what the jury hears here
   which counts.

        THE CORONER:   Indeed, but it may be of help to me.
   That's it, thank you, Mr. Richards.

        Now Mr. Langley.

                N0RMA1 GEORGE LANGLEY Sworn

                         By THE CORONER:

Q. Are you Norman George Langley? - A. Yes.

   Is your address                               Cheshire? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You are in fact a coach driver? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you drive a coach down to the match in 1989? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Are you employed by somebody? - A. I am employed by
   Selwyn's of Runcorn.

Q. Where did you set off from? - A. It is right outside
   Anfield. We deal with the Liverpool Supporters direct.

Q. Do you know how many coaches set off of your company from
   there? - A. There were in the region of five for
   supporters and the double decker coach for directors.
                                               N.   G . LANGLEY


What time did you set off? - A. I would say about eleven
o'clock.   Half past ten or eleven o'clock.

Were you first, last or...  I mean, did you all go off
together? - A. All the supporters left togetherand then
the directors* coach leaves about half eleven.

You were on a supporters' coach? - A. Yes.

So you left about 11.30? - A. Yes, approximately.

What 1 am more interested in is what time did you get
into Sheffield? - A. The coaches started parking up on
Halifax Road at about ten to two, five to two, something
like that.

Your coach? - A. My coach was the first or second of our
set of coaches.

Actually you went in convoy? - A. Basically.

You started parking at about? - A. At about five to two.

When you parked in Halifax Road, were there other coaches
already there? - A. Yes, there were several parked in
front of us. We were near the top of the hill.    It is a
hill, that road.

Can you estimate how many you think might have been
there? - A. In front of us I would say approximately
about half a dozen to ten, at the most.

About ten you would think? - A. At the most, maximum.

I am getting an approximation.   You parked up there.
You were intending to go to the match yourself as well? -
A. Originally no.   It is just that I go quite often on
these excursions and the stewards on our coach who are
supplied by the Liverpool Club, occasionally have the odd
spare ticket and they found I didn't have one this time
and so I got first refusal.

So you were lucky, in a sense.   I mean, in the light of
events maybe not, but you thought you were.     I just
want to go back to the coaches again, the ones already
parked.   You do not know by any chance which companies
they were or not? - A. No.

You parked? - A. Yes.

I take it that being an official coach you had no
alcohol? - A. No, none at all.

Everybody was well behaved? - A. Yes.
                                                           116




                                                N.   G . LANGLEY


Q. Were you stopped and searched by any police? - A. My
   coach was the only one that was stopped and searched.
   There were intermittent stops.   It was just as we came
   off the Ml, about 200 or 300 yards down the road we were
   coding back out of.

Q. So you were checked? - A. Yes.

Q. Did they check for tickets?    Do you remember? - A. Ho,
   they checked for any possible offensive weapons such as
   canes which hold flags.    They just said to the lads,
   "Have you got flags?    You can take flags in but no
   sticks, no canes, no cans of coke, no nothing."
   Basically they searched the coach.    They asked me to
   undo my lockers underneath and they checked.

Q. They did do a proper job? - A. Yes.   They gave me a
   sticker to say it had been checked.

Q. I want to take you then off your coach, you are walking
   down Halifax Road towards the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any police officers engaged in any activities
   with regard to the fans? - A. When we first stopped the
   police officers came on board the coach and did the same
   as the previous officers had done at the roundabout.
   They explained to them that they hoped the had a good
   time, it was a nice day, once again repeating no cans,
   don't take any alcohol into the ground and flags, they
   could take flags but nothing with canes or sticks
   involved.

Q. It was very amiable? - A. Yes, it was of a good nature.
   On the way down the road towards the roundabout at
   Leppings Lane I would say every 20 yards, more or less,
   there were pockets of policemen, two or three at a time,
   stopping fans, even some who had already been checked on
   our coach, and explaining what they wanted to do and in
   some cases searching them.   In one case a police van had
   stopped just underneath the railway bridge to give a
   ticking off to a young lad who had decided he needed a
   toilet.

Q. I'm sorry? - A. They stopped underneath a railway bridge
   and jumped out and gave a ticking off to a young lad who
   had been caught short for toilets, but he was trying to
   seclude himself obviously.

Q. I see, he was hiding, but they had spotted him? - A. Yes.
   As I say, the police were very stringent on the way into
   the roundabout.

Q. Did you see any drinking on the way down? - A. I saw the
   residues of drink, that s all, that is, the odd can on
                                                               117




                                                    N.   G . LANGLEY


   top of a wall.    They were not rolling around the floor
   or anything.

Q. Just the odd ones or thousands? - A. No, I never went out
   of my way looking for them.   There could have been.   I
   only saw the odd ones.

Q. It is not very interesting, is it? - A. No, I just saw
   the odd one or two on walls as I was passing, but the
   pubs basically around there - I think there was one pub
   and   one club, both seemed to be   shut and boarded up,but
   I later found out that the club     -    I think it was onthe
   right going down - was in fact open, but opened behind
   closed doors.

Q. But   it looked shut to you? - A. I looked    shut.

Q. You   didn't go in, anyway? -A. Oh,     no.

Q. You went to the ground? - A. I went to the roundabout
   first to speak to a couple of my co-drivers who had just
   come off the directors' coach, asking them if they had
   got tickets, because normally the directors do dish out
   tickets to the lads driving the coaches.    On this
   occasion for some reason they hadn't.    I said I had
   managed to acquire one.    I stood on the roundabout with
   a couple of them waiting to see other stewards off some
   of our other coaches to see if they had spare tickets for
   these other drivers.    I stood there until about twenty
   to three, just after twenty to three, and then I said,
   "I'll walk up now and I'll try and get in and I will see
   you in there if you get a ticket."

Q. At 14.40 you went towards the ground? - A. Roughly, yes.

Q. When you got to the gate was it busy? -A. It was quite
   brisk, the street.    It wasn't solid. Everyone could
   move freely.     There were vehicles passing up and down.
   I arrived atthe Leppings Lane gates.    There   was quite a
   crowd up against the turnstiles.    I just joined in the
   throng of people trying to get into the ground.     Just as
   I joined in they shut the smaller gates outside.     There
   was extreme pressure and crushing in between these gates
   and the turnstiles, so much so that some of the younger
   children were getting hoisted up and pushed up on to the
   walls.   The way they attempted trying to get people out
   - it wasn't an attempt to try and get people into the
   ground, it was trying to get people out of the crush.
   There tended to be one or maybe two policemen on
   horseback inside and there were a couple of foot
   policemen as     well. There may have been more but I only
   saw a couple at the time.    They were more or less by the
   gate.   I asked one policeman what the hell was going on,
    Are you shut or what?"    He said, "No, we are closing
                                              N.   G . LANGLEY


that gate to   try and relieve the pressure between the
gate and the   turnstile."   I said, "All you are doing is
causing more   problems there because they are squeezing in
and the gate   is being shut on them."   He said, "Try and
tell them."     He said, "1*11 try and tell them and if you
can tell any   friends you have got that the gates will be
re-opened as   soon as that pressure is relieved."

Obviously people were trying to tell other people by word
of mouth.    Later, as I say, it was still no better.

So you didn't feel that shutting the perimeter gates was
any use? - A. No, 1 thought it made it worse.

You thought it was a mistake? - A. Well, they had at
least two horses in there and they were usinj the horses
to try and divide the people up into some sort of...
But when you have enclosed an area and those horses are
pushing, people are scared of horses when they are like
that, especially in a confined area, and they seemed to
be causing more crush than anything else.

That's is within the turnstile area? - A. Just within
that turnstile area.

Did you think it was going to cause any more problems on
the other side of the perimeter gates? - A. I don't think
it caused problems.    I think after a while people would
realise what was going on and there wasn't any excessive
pressure on the gates from the outside.    There were
people up against them but not excessive pressure.     They
weren't bending the gates.

You were already on the inside by then? - A. No.

Oh, you were still on the outside? - A. Yes.    I never
went inside until this other policeman Who 1 only saw
from the rear, a very large policeman on a horse, somehow
a gate on the right hand side of the turnstiles, a big,
large gate, it looked like a major exit gate.    1 never
saw it being opened but it was opened.    This policeman
on a horse, a large chap, as I say, he was gesticulating
verbally, and all ways, to get the crowd round to the
side of this gate and into this gate and then a foot
policeman asked what   1 would assume was a steward to open
the right hand gate.     There were like twosmaller gates
on the side by the bank.    He asked them to open the
gates.   The steward seemed to be a bit evasive on
whether he should do it or whether he shouldn't do it.
In the end, I don't know whether it was the policeman who
opened it or one of the supporters who was there
listening to the conversation, and we just went in.     It
wasn't a rush.   We just walked in because only one gate
                                                          119




                                               N.   G . LANGLEY


flung open, the one nearest the bank itself.    Then
eventually the other one must have been opened.

I walked in quite comfortably.    I was not   pushed or
rushed in any way.   I ended up going into    the large
gate, around the side of the turnstiles.      There was one
policeman there who I offered ray ticket to   and he said,
 No, just carry on, make your way in.”

The only other policeman I saw was at the rear of the
turnstiles.   It was only one policeman there.   In front
of me there was a tunnel with A or B above the tunnel.
There were no other directions to say there were other
tunnels and there was no visible means of other tunnels,
so I assumed straight through the same tunnel as
everybody else.   At this time there wasn't a lot of
people there.   There was just people briskly walking in.

I entered the tunnel.   It had been a very bright day and
as I got into the tunnel it was pitch black and it was a
case of you were feeling your way, basically, with your
feet or whatever.   There were other people with you so
you tended to go along, making certain you weren't going
to slip on a step or anything.   All of a sudden, when
your eyes were adjusted, then you could see what was
happening at the end of the tunnel.   By this time I was
about half or three-quarters of the way through the
tunnel.

The next minute there seemed to be a rush, a surge, of
people.   It just started from a normal, quick, brisk
walk through the tunnel into a massive surge at the end
of the tunnel.   So much so that I wasn't aware there was
a barrier at the end of this tunnel until when I got to
the end I quickly bounced off the side of the barrier and
was thrown to the left hand side.




               As I say, as I was
                                                    120

                                 N.G.    LANGLEY




      As I say as I was approaching towards the end of
the tunnel I could see there was players on the football
field because I could see a red and a green shirt.

      The next thing I was into the pen surging down the
steps over one barrier on to the floor, a couple of like
that and we got up. A couple of us had gone over or under
the barrier of some description.  I quickly got up and
then you were pushed again you were surged down and then
several times I had gone down again, by which time I was
near the base of the steps but I was against people, I
was being weaved in between people through the pressure
and before you know it I was not quite standing I was
more half crouched than anything else trying to get up
each time and at the same time as you were trying to get
up people were pushing you forward and you were going
down and you were still trying to get up all the time.

      Soon I was down on the floor.   It seemed to be
a while. One lad was saying:    "This lad's down, let's
get him up". Someone tried to get me up and as he was
trying to get me up he came down and then we finally
sort of like were squashed. We were getting unbearably
squashed.  It got to a stage where you would not have
been able to rise from the floor from a crouching position
and shortly after I could hear people then just shouting:
"Get back" and then when I managed to rise this one
time I could hear, I presume they were Stewards and Police
behind the goal because then I was virtually within feet
of them and they were shouting:   "Push back, push back"
and I could hear people saying:   "How the hell can you
push, you can't even bloody breathe in here" and it was
just impossible to move any of them, so much so that
I was down again and I could not get up this time.

      THE CORONER: Just take your time. Have a little
drink. Do you want a break? Shall we just break for
a few minutes.  I think we can stop for five minutes
and allow this witness to recover all right. We will
stop for a few minutes and give you a chance.  Okay.
Then we will let you carry on. You are doing very very
well indeed.

      MR. MANNING:  I wonder if the jury could be
excused and I might just address you sir?

      THE CORONER:   Yes.

                     (The jury retire)

      MR. MANNING:   We have all clearly got a problem
here sir.
                                                     121




      I understand your concern to try and have this
witness give his evidence today.   Equally with the
greatest of respect there is no way in which this is
a short witness.  He starts really right at the very
beginning and comes all the way down the road, through
the crowd, in through the gate. He is very upset.
The jury have, by our rule of thumb, been now sitting
for two-and-a-half hours which is a longer time than
we have ever gone without a break.   I am pretty tired
after a long day in which we have had a lot of witnesses.
They must be equally tired.

      THE CORONER:  Shall we bring him back tomorrow.
I think I will finish my examination-in-chief anyway.

      MR. KING:  Sir, it is convenient while the jury
aren't here, this witness as you know sir has identi­
fication evidence in relation to Christopher Traynor.

      THE CORONER: That is why I was so anxious because
I knew the family were here.

      MR. KING: Might I just find out whether it is
all right for them to come back tomorrow, not because
I seek to change your view, sir, but if they can't it
is a factor which I ought to draw to your attention.

      THE CORONER: Well the point is that is why I
want to finish my examination-in-chief because I hope
to get that part of the evidence answered, that if for
some reason they could not come, at least they will
have heard ....

      MR. KING: Sir, I agree.    I will leave that with
you sir for the moment.

      THE CORONER:   But please take instructions.

      MR. KING:  Sir,  as I thought, the family would
be grateful if you could complete it in chief because
a number of members are working members and they have
made a special effort to come today.

      THE CORONER: Well that is what I would like to
do but I agree with Mr. Manning that it is not fair.
I had in mind the identification evidence when I said
he would be short.  I had forgotten all about everything
else.  It is better for you and for him if we don't
rush it and for me as well.

      MR. KING: Sir, while the jury again aren't here,
you are probably aware of what was said at the mini
Inquest to this Inquest about the pen he was in and
what an Officer had asked him about the night before.
                                                    122




     THE CORONER:   Yes.

      MR. KING:  If I can draw to your attention to that
passage, I have it here in front of me.

      THE CORONER:   Can you just do that and remind me.
Is this the chap who got the pens wrong because he was
facing the wrong way?

       MR. KING: Sir, there is evidence that Christopher
was in enclosure 3, Pen 3. This witness who is adamant,
I think he is going to be adamant that he was helped up
by Christopher says he was in Pen 4, which is hard to
reconcile, but the Officer who was giving evidence to you
at the mini Inquest reported to you a conversation he had.
with this witness the night before which might explain
how it came about and he was in the same.

      THE CORONER:  Yes, I remember this now.   Hewas
sitting backward and so he got his ....

      MR. KING:   Sir, if that helps you sir it may be
that could be dealt with.   Sir, it is page 6. It is
Detective Sergeant Graham McCombie's evidence. Page 6
letters D f E and F sir.




                       THE CORONER:   We spent a long
                                                                 123



                                             N.   G.   LANGLEY




     THE CORONER:   We spent a long time on the legal
submissions this morning.  I know we have to from time
to time, but this is an important witness for the
family.

    (The Witness and the Jury Returned to Court)

     THE WITNESS:   I am sorry about that.

     THE CORONER:    That is quite all right, Mr.
Langley.   I know it is very hard for everybody
including you and of course for the family as well.
Mr. Langley, just tell me, you had got to the point
where you had fallen down and I think somebody was
lifting you up, is that right? - A. I got to the stage
where I just could not get myself up then someone's
hand just sort of came out of the blue and dragged me
up by my hair at first. At the same time I was pushing
but it was literally like the expression sardines in a
can, you can't move, I was just edging very slowly.
The person's hand lost grip, the hand came again and
dragged me up again. This time with a bit of help from
myself he managed to get me in a head-lock.   My head
under his arm, like that. The person didn't know who
he had hold of, he just put a hand out and grabbed
whoever he could.   I myself had already when being down
was aware of someone in front of me, partially
underneath me, and at the same time as I was trying to
get up myself I was pulling the person at the same
time, in one hand, at the same time shouldering up with
the other.   I could not get no further than the head-
lock and all I could see was just blue skies, all I
could was inhale and basically not exhale.   Obviously I
was but I couldn't do it in the normal fashion.

I was in that position then for it seemed like a
lifetime.   I heard people shouting, "The fence is being
pushed in".   From what I am aware of later they pushed
in one of the front grilles, they were ripping them off
with their hands apparently, the Police and the
supporters.   The first fence had gone in and they were
helping people.   By this time there must have been some
relief coming from the back of the crowd.   The next
thing I realised is the pressure seemed to ease behind.
I was starting to be able to move slightly and by this
time it all happened, it seemed to me, at once, we
seemed to get the pressure relieved and someone said,
"Mind your heads", because then the second gate or
grille, whatever it was, that seemed to be whipped out
and just missing our heads, to which everyone then
around me was just collapsed on the floor.

I didn't understand that - say that again? Something
came through from the gate? - A. No, it is the fencing.
                                                               1 24



                                           N.   G.   LANGLEY




One fence apparently had been ripped open and the one
that was immediately above myself and this person who
had held me up, that suddenly burst open and people
were shouting, "Mind your heads".  At the same time
they said that, the pressure behind had released and
everyone was going down anyway, in a heap.  Virtually
at the same time all this happened a Policeman just
appeared from somewhere next to me. He took this
person's arm off my neck, as he realised I was moving.
He rolled the person over in front and I started
pumping his chest because I realised he wasn't
breathing.  The Policeman then in turn tried to give
him mouth to mouth resuscitation.  After several
attempts, both, we just eased off because we seemed to
be exhausted or whatever.  The next minute we heard a
noise coming from the person's body. A noise seemed to
come out of the mouth of the person, to which I
exclaimed, "Anyone got oxygen, he's alive".  At that
point Police Officers and I think St. John's people and
other helpers had come through the fencing and that
person then was taken away from me and the Policeman by
these people, just lost in a mass of bodies, but people
from what I gathered tried to give oxygen.

After that the next thing I remember was I was waking
up laid out on the six yard line, and I was being given
oxygen.

I think I want to go back and just fill in a few
details now with regard to where you were and things
like that.  Do you know which pen you entered? - A. All
I know is I was on the left hand side of the tunnel.
What number pen it was I don't know.

I think you subsequently saw a photograph of somebody,
didn't you, and you thought that was the person who had
tried to save your life, and in fact succeeded? That
is right, isn't it, or how did you find out about that?
- A . No, I rung up the Sheffield number I was given.  I
spoke to a WPC and I gave the WPC the description of
the person that I was with at the time and the position
where we were in this pen.   She told me what pen it
was, I just described where I was because I had not
seen a thing from once I entered, or just prior to that
time, to when I was being picked up off the floor,
other than noting little things.

The reason why I ask you is this, because in fact you
think it is Christopher Traynor, don't you? - A. I was
told it was Christopher Traynor by the WPC.

Did you identify him by means of a photograph at his
home? Are you saying you think it was Christopher
Traynor because you were told or are you saying you

 think it is Christopher Traynor because you recognised
 him? > A. At the time I was told. On a later date a
 photograph was shown to me, and from the recollection
 of the position I was in and the condition of his body
 at the time, it seemed to be the same person.

. The reason why I am asking basically is this, that
  Christopher Traynor as far as we can tell was in Pen 3,
  which is in fact the right hand pen.  Now, if you were
  in the left hand pen of course you could not have been
  anywhere near him? - A. Obviously.

. That is right, isn't it? So what I want to try and
  find out is can you remember how you entered the pen?
  Did you go into the pen frontways or backward, because
  you will realise if you went in frontways the left is
  this side, and if you went in backwards the left is
  that side, in fact the exact opposite pen to which you
  think? - A. I could not say for certain.  I was just
  bundled in and to me I ended up as though I was on the
  left.  I do know I have been back to that place since
  and looked at it from above, and the person I was with
  at the time, I said to him, "It doesn t look the same".
  Having said that I was looking at it from above, and I
  was looking from down below at that time, so I could
  not be certain on that.




               /Q      Do you remember
                                           N.   G.   LANGLEY


Do you remember in April or May time I think you met
one of my Officers and you discussed with him your
entering into the pen, can you remember that? - A.
No, I can't.  I only remember speaking to one Officer
and he came to m y works.  That is the only one I have
spoken to offhand to m y recollection.

Do you remember somebody speaking to you on the
telephone or in person on about 27th April 1990?
This is just a few months ago and discussing with him
how you got into the pen? - A. No, not from memory,
no.

That does not ring a bell with you at all? - A. Not
offhand.

Sergeant McCombie gave me evidence in April time and
what he said was, "The evidence regarding Mr. Langley
has been researched for several months and was only
clarified at 7 pm last night when he was spoken
to"? - A. I do remember now the phone call.

The way you entered the pen? - A. The person I spoke
to now, I remember now a Policeman did ring but when
it exactly was I don't know and what exactly it was
appertaining to I don't know.

You cannot remember now. - A. But as to basically
what the conversation was all about I do remember
receiving the phone call because it had something to
do with the Inquest the next day or something and his
last words were, "Leave it with me.  I'll sort it
out" and so I am unaware of anything said.

How sure are you that the person who you described
held you in the armlock is in fact Christopher
Traynor? From the Inquest point of view it does not
matter that much but it is important for you and it
is important for the family which is why I am asking
you these questions. - A. As I said, the photograph I
actually seen of Christopher Traynor was I think in
the local paper.  Before anything else I was told by
a person these facts are given.  There was only one
person of that name.  I remember the description of
his hair and his facial features, his size or
features, so to speak and the size of the boy
himself. When I saw the photograph it didn't not
look like him.

It didn't look... - A.  It didn't not look like him.
At the same time the person who had died beneath me
or on top of me whatever the case may be he was
obviously discoloured, distraught and the features
were gone, the normal features.  Having said that,
basically what I saw in the photograph and what I saw
beneath me or by me seemed to be at the time the same

   person.  I had no reason to doubt that because, as I
   say, no one other than myself with this latest piece
   of information has given me any reason to doubt it.

Q. It just depends which pen you were in, you see? - A.
   Yes, I will be honest with you, all I know is that I
   went in left.  I was in a swell, I was upside down,
   back to front, over barriers, up barriers, and all I
   saw was daylight.

Q. Perhaps we can attack this from a slightly different
   angle.  Do you say the fencing had been pulled? - A.
   The fencing had been physically ripped off.  It
   hadn't been used.

Q. It had been bent? - A. I don't know about the first
   one but I think the second one seemed to come inward
   because people said, "Mind your head".

Q. Did you ever see any gates? - A. The only gates I
   think I saw...

Q. At the front I mean, at the perimeter fence? - A. No.

Q. You do not remember that? - A. Only later I saw
   gates.

Q. I do not mind when you saw it. Do you remember
   seeing a gate in the perimeter fence? - A. Yes, when
   I was laid out and I had sat up on the pitch I saw
   it.

Q. Do you know which side of the gate the fencing had
   been bent inward? - A. The gate would be on my left.

Q. The gate was on your left and where was the gap in
   the fencing? - A. To the right of the gate.

Q. I think we have got a picture somewhere of the gate
   which we can show you. Mr. Langley, we are going to
   have to have you back tomorrow, I might as well tell
   you now because we cannot possibly finish this
   afternoon.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I know what was said a short time
ago by one of my colleagues but it is now five to five and
I know I do not have very much to ask this witness and I
just wonder in the circumstances whether we could not all
stay here until his evidence is complete so that he does
not have to come back tomorrow.   I have tried to gather
from my learned friends the length of time they will be and
the general view seems to be that they will not have many
questions. It would be a ....

    THE CORONER:   A kindness to the witness certainly.
                                                            128



                                                  N.    G . LANGLEY


     MR. ISAACS:   We have all gone over the time anyway
and so such arrangements we may have had anyway seem to
have gone by the board, sir.

       THE CORONER:     I am quite happy.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, if you are looking for a photograph
there is a series of photographs beginning at 23.

     THE CORONER:       Because it might give us a clue as to
the pen.

     MR. PAYNE:       Mr. King and I agree about this
completely!

       THE CORONER:     That is good.

     MR. KING:   If I may suggest 23 and 27 in the bundle
because they give the clearest indication of the different
way in which the fencing in the different pens moved.

Q.        THE CORONER:    What side did you say you thought
     the gap was in relation to the gate? - A. I think it
     would be on my left.




                              /Q. I think we are probably.
                                                           129



                                               N.   G.   LANGLEY


Q. I think we are probably on a loser with this because both
   the openings are on the left, aren't they?    Does it
   help you at all? - A. No.   All I can remember, as I say,
   I remember fencing being ripped out and people saying,
   "Mind your head,” and soon after I was awakening left of
   the goalpost on the 6 yard line, so whether I had been
   brought from this side or that side I could not say.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS;

Q. Just one matter please and that is this: you tell us you
   were half way down the tunnel having got there through a
   normal, quick walk and then there is a massive surge? -A.
   Yes, it seemd to be a massive surge.   It was just a rush
   of people.

Q. The only point I wanted to ask you was this, Mr. Langley:
   you were actually in the middle of the tunnel when this
   surge came behind you? - A. Yes, because there had been
   such bright sunlight and it was just complete black and
   it took me nearly half the length of the tunnel just to
   get my eyesight...

Q. That force propelled down the tunnel? - A. Yes.,

Q. That force, would this be fair, you having got there
   through a quick walk, was over and above what you would
   have expected to have come from behind you at that time?
   You just weren't expecting it? - A. I wasn't expecting
   it, but at the same time because no-one was there with me
   when we went in the tunnel, I just didn't expect that
   force then.   However, having said that, I came round
   into behind the turnstiles with people from the outside
   and they were still trying to get people to come in from
   in between the perimeter gate and the turnstiles, into
   that same gate.   Now what happened after me, I
   couldn't...

Q. I appreciate that, but what happened was this: you had
   gone at a quick walk down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Then suddenly there is this exceptional force that pushes
   you at an even faster speed down the rest of the way? -
   A. Yes.   It wasn't dangerous, but it was fast. ^ There
   were a lot of people like myself.   We were rushing to
   get into the kick-off and had just rushed that little bit
   extra.

Q. Hell, you say it wasn't dangerous but you say you were
   bounced off the barrier? - A. Yes, because that barrier
   was not visible.   I think even walking down that tunnel
   with a full crowd of people, walking in there, there is
   no way you could see that barrier.   I could be abreast,
   in the middle of three people, walking down that tunnel.
                                                           130

   There is no light in that tunnel.    Therefore, if you
   come out of bright daylight and you are going into a
   bright thing you can't even see the thing because there
   are bodies in front of you.   All of a sudden you have
   got this double barrier.

Q. It is just that I got the impression you had been going
   at a reasonably quick speed, a quick walk, and then there
   had been a change in pace caused by this propulsion -
   however it was caused - from behind you? - A. Yes.   As I
   say, it is just not noticeable, the barrier, because of
   people in front of me and all of a sudden it came out the
   blue.

               Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Q. I just want to continue that point.    You were walking
   quickly down the tunnel.   You would have thereby gained
   the terrace, but as it was you were moved involuntarily
   and more quickly towards the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Because of that you can't tell us anything about the
   terrace itself.   You were just pushed into it and
   continued to be... - A. I can only tell you the aftermath
   of the terraces.

Q. Which is awful and about which I have the greatest
   sympathy.   The second question I am going to ask you I
   suppose pales into insignificance, but some of the things
   we have to do is to try and reconcile the bits of
   information we are given.    We were told very much
   earlier, indeed last year, when we heard a couple of
   witnesses about the perimeter gates.    It seems a time
   came when a police officer and a steward actually closed
   that perimeter gate through which you came and they
   talked in terms of hoards and hoards of people.     In fact
   the steward said that the police officer who was on the
   crowd side of the gate instead of the club side of the
   gate, "He was very brave.    I was scared.”   Now
   eventually that gate was pushed open, the force of the
   crowd pushing it open.    It may very well be you didn't
   see any of that and when you got to it it was open.     I
   wanted to be sure that you had actually seen it closed at
   some stage, or could it have... - A. Which gate are you
   talking about?   There are three sets of double gates
   there.

Q. The perimeter gate, the one near to the riverside, which
   you said you went through. - A. That one was closed along
   with the other two across, but the other two across had
   all the people in between them.   This one had no-one and
   there was no pressure.   I think you could have just
   unlocked it and gone in anyway, but the steward seemed to
   be - I wouldn't say arguing, but he seemed to give the
                                                               131

   impression he was not prepared to open it.   He said, "If
   you want to open it, you open it," or words to that
   effect.   I can't actually remember.   Basically the door
   was opened by the policeman.   The one side, the one
   nearest the...   It was only a small one.   The other two
   were larger gates, the ones leading on to the turnstiles.
   The other one near the bank was a smaller version of
   those gates.

        MR. MANNING:   I don't press the matter further. As
   I have said, it pales into insignificance in the light of
   the dreadful events you have had to relate.    Thank you
   very much.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Langley, I still want to investigate a little further
   if we can the business of which pen you were in, not only
   to help yourself but to help the family of Christopher
   Traynor a little more.   As I understand your evidence,
   when you did see the photograph which we know is of
   Christopher, your view was that it seemed to be the same
   person.   You said to the Inquest, in these terms, it
   didn't seem it wasn't him, if I can put it that way?
   That is right, isn't it? - A. Well, as I say, I only saw
   that one photograph.

Q. Indeed. - A. It was a photograph that to me was a
   photograph that was not of him.    It was a photograph,
   in my mind, of the person I saw underneath me.    Having
   said that, that person was in a position of slight
   distortion.

Q. You eventually remembered when the Coroner reminded you,
   of a conversation on the 'phone with a police officer the
   day before the Inquest was going to take place.   Do you
   remember? - A. I do remember that now, yes.

Q. I have a note of what that officer told the Coroner the
   next day of that conversation.   He could be wrong, of
   course.   I just want to tell you what he told the
   Coroner about that conversation to see whether it jogs
   your memory about what was said in that conversation.

       MR. RING:   Sir, I am looking at what I have
  described as page 6 of that short transcript note of the
  evidence, just after letter D, sir, of Mr. McCombie's
  evidence.   This is a reference to page 6 of the
  transcript of the Inquest into the Death of Christopher
  James Traynor which was held on Friday, 27th April, 1990.

        THE CORONER:     Why don't you read that bit to him?

        MR. KING:      Yes, sir, I will read it.
                                                                 132


                                                 N.   G.   LANGLEY


Q. The Coroner asked the police officer this question:

       "One of the problems   has been that initially      Mr.
       Langley said that he   was in enclosure 4."

  That is the one which is to the left as you enter face
  forwards.   The officer said, "Yes, sir,  to the Coroner.
  Then the Coroner asked the witness this:

       "All the evidence we have been able to find is that
       Christopher was in enclosure 3."

  That is the other endsoure.     The officer said this:

       "There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that
       Christopher and Kevin were in pen 3.   Mr. Langley
       was adamant that as he came through the tunnel he
       went to the left of the barrier.”

  Which, of course, is what   you have told us   today.     The
  officer continued in this   way:

       "I spoke to him..."

  That is yourself:

       "...last night and he says that the more he thinks
       about it the more he gets confused, but he did
       suggest that as he came through the tunnel he was
       spun round and disorientated and when he turned to
       the left he was actually looking back out of the
       tunnel which would put him into pen 3, sir."

  First of all do you understand what I have read out to
  you? - A. Yes.




          Q* First of all, do you have

                                     N.G.   LANGLEY




q   . First of all do you have a recollection of the conversation
      with the Officer concerning itself with which pen you
      were in and how you entered the pen? - A. The aspects of
      the conversation I cannot recollect to memory.  Basically
      all I knew was concerning the Inquest the next day. As
      I say it was late at night when he rung me. He had rung
      several times because I had not finished work till late
      so exactly what had happened, but I will concur with the
      man that the fact is I was rushed through that tunnel.   I
      can't say yes I was and I can't say no I wasn't though I
      was not spun round because so much happened in getting
      pushed through that tunnel and ending up in a position.
      As I said before the only thing I remember then later
      I could not even say which fence exactly I got taken out
      of because for the simple reason being I blacked out and
      I woke up alongside the penalty area, alongside the goal
      to the left-hand side facing towards I think it is the
      Kop end now, so whether or not I came actually out from
      the fencing immediately in front of that position I was
      in or whether I was carried to that position I don't know
      because there was so many people lying around.

Q. Could we perhaps summarise it this way:  the suggestion
   that you might in fact have been spun round so that when
   you went to your left you were in fact backwards to the
   pitch, that suggestion might be right? - A. It is a
   possibility.

           MR. KING:   Sir, I will leave it at that.   Thank you.


                 Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Langley, have you been shown a plan today of the
   pens?

           THE CORONER: No, I have decided, I will show it
     him if you wish, but I have decided against letting him
     mark it because it is so difficult for this witness to
     put a cross.

           MRS. McBRIEN:   I thought it might help him.

           THE WITNESS:  I have seen some of them up on the
     screen and the only cross I can put up is where I woke
     up for want of a better expression.

Q.         THE CORONER: Where would it be?    Show us on that.
     - A. On the pitch itself.

Q.         MRS. McBRIEN: Are you an experienced football
     supporter? - A. I have supported Liverpool since their
     Second Division days, yes.

Q. So you have been to a lot of matches? - A. Abroad as well,
   yes.

Q. So when you heard a Police Officer saying:  "Open the
   gates" you knew that referred to what you understood to
   be a major exit gate. Were you surprised? - A. No, I
   must correct you there. The gate in question was the
   gate on the right-hand side by the river, that was the
   gate that was being asked to be opened.  The actual big
   gate just seemed to be open. Who opened it I don't know.
   It appeared to be closed one minute and then open the
   next.

Q. I am sorry, I have been finding it difficult to hear
   quite honestly this afternoon so I have not got it
   correct, sorry about that, but when you did enter through
   the gate, the concertina gate, and you offered your ticket
   to a Police Officer I believe? - A. Yes.

Q. And he said:  "No, carry on" did that surprise you? - A.
   I would say yes and no because he is not in a position
   to accept the tickets anyway because he can't formulate
   how many people are going through the turnstiles so
   technically I suppose it is immaterial to him whether
   he gets the ticket or not. The actual person that got
   my ticket was the Liverpool Chairman at the time,
   Peter Robinson, and he got it in the middle of the football
   field on my way over to the dug-out where I was put. He
   has still got my ticket as far as I know.

Q. Were you surprised to go into the Stadium in that way?
   - A. I was, but having said that what you could see
   outside there was no way people could get through the
   turnstiles because they were that squashed into the
   turnstile, the actual turnstile would not be able to
   turn I should not think because the people must have been
   just concertined on to the actual turnstile itself and
   people could not come back off it to let it turn round.

Q. Would you have preferred more time outside whilst some
   organisation was ... A. A lot more organisation.   I went
   back to Sheffield several months later and the absolute
   difference in organisation was unbelievable.  If that
   organisation had been there in the first place none of
   us would be here now.

Q. When did you go back to Sheffield? - A. I think it was
   when Liverpool played Sheffield.

Q. Can you remember when it was? - A. Oh, the exact date,
   it was the early part of 1989 I think it was.

Q.         THE CCORONER: Early part of 1989? - A. Yes, early
     part of 1989 when we played Sheffield on their ground.
     I may be wrong.  It was in the winter anyway whenever it
     was.
                                                                        135

           Q. This was before the match then, wasn't it? I believe
              my son went to that match, if it is that one. - A. After
              the match, when Liverpool played Sheffield after the
              match.   I know it was winter because it was diabolically
              freezing.
     B
                       MR. ISAACS:   I think it was a testimonial game sir.

                    THE WITNESS: No, it was a league game because
              Sheffield actually beat Liverpool 2-1.

                    MR. ISAACS:      The terraces weren't open on that
              occasion.

                    THE WITNESS: No, the terraces weren't but the
              Stands were. That is why I say the next time I went
              back to Sheffield I was sitting in the position.

                    MRS. McBRIEN: No, it isn't the same time.       I
              think that is all, thank you very much.


    1} I                         Further By The CORONER:

           Q. I can't remember whether in all the anxiety about which
              pen you were in I actually tried to pinpoint ....
              Did you say you saw the players on the pitch when you
              were coming through? - A. T just saw a red shirt and a green
              shirt.

           Q. And that really was the last thing you saw? - A. I never
              heard the kick-off whistle. Apparently according to some
              records Beardsley had nearly scored.

           Q. But you never saw that? - A. I never saw anything.

                    THE CORONER: Thank you very much.   I am sorry that
              we have had to distress you but there it is. Mrs. Traynor
              is it at the back? Thank you for being here.

                       I take it that we have nothing else that we need
              to do?     (No response)  10 o'clock tomorrow.


                              (The Inquests were adjourned
                          to 10 o'clock the following morning)
