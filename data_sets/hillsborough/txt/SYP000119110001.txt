             On Saturday,           15 A p r i l         1 98 9     (150489)          I commenced              d u t y at       8 *3 0 a m

              (0830)       at   Main Street              Police         Station,             Rotherham,          for     football            duties

              in    connection with                the    semi-final             at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l           Ground.

              I was    in       charge       of S e r i a l s      41     to 4 3     on S u b - S e c t o r        16;    my      immediate

             Supervising           Officer          was       Chief       Inspector            Purdy.

             Basically           those       duties       allocated             to m y        serials         involved Public                 Order

             Wadsley        Bridge       Railway          Station          to    the         termination           of    the     dual

              carriageway          at    the       junction          of H a l i f a x         R o a d a n d D e e r lan d s        Avenue.

             Halifax        Road and          the    surrounding                streets            were    designated            as    the

             arrival        and    parking          area       for L i v e r p o o l          supporters.               I know        this        area

             very     well       having       spent       the       first       seven         or    eight      years      of     my 2 2 y e a r s

              service       working          in    that       area.

              I also       worked       the       semi-final            the     year         before       last w h e n L e e d s U n i t e d

              played Coventry                C ity and my            duties        then were              almost        identical            to

              those    on t hi s        occasion.

              I live w i t h i n        one       mile    of       that    area and             regularly          use    Halifax            Road.

              I am a football                supporter             and attend           almost          all    the S h e f f i e l d

             Wednesday           home    fixtures             at    Hillsborough.

              I have       worked       at    most       of    the      semi-finals                at H i l l s b o r o u g h     over       the
years       and many          first         division matches                   in my          early       years       of    service.

I was       also      on d u t y       for       the W o r l d C u p          matches          held       at H i l l s b o r o u g h        in

1966.

l'n a d d i t i o n      I have        regularly              performed            duties          as    a Sergeant          at       the

Sheffield United                   football            g r o u n d at B r a m a l l           Lane       and    occasional

duties       at     the     other          three       South Yorkshire                   Football             League       grounds.

I wa s      on d u t y      at     the      semi-final            between Liverpool                       and Notts.             Forest

in    ‘1988,       w h e n my      duties         concerned             supervision                of    serials       responsible

for    the L e p p i n g s         Lane         turnstiles.

On Saturday,               15 A p r i l ,        1989      (150489)           I set       off       from Mai n Street

Police       Station          for      Hillsborough               shortly           before          9.00am       (0900)          in a

Personnel           Carrier           with Serial              Number         42    led       by PS 2 1 7 1       Keenan.

We    travelled            via Ha lifax               Road and          I indicated                to    officers          in the

vehicle        that        s e c t i o n w h i c h was          to      be    patrolled             by S e r i a l     Number          42.

We a r r i v e d      at    th e      ground          at 9 . 3 0 a m     (0930)          for a          10.00 am       (1000)

briefing.             The     briefing            took        place      at    10.00am             (1000)       and    after          having

a    packed        lunch,        at    11.00am           (1100)         I walked          from          the    grpund       to H a l i f a x

Road     with Serials                 41    to 43.

There       wa s    no     change          to    those        duties         allocated             in the       operational

briefing           not es .        About         11.20am        (1120)         together             w ith PS K e e n a n          I

approached            the     White         Horse        Public         House       in H a l i f a x          Road w ith a view

to    establishing               whether          or     not    the      licensee             intended          opening.              As    I

d i d so a m a l e          person who                identified             himself          as    the       licensee       came          out

of    the    premises.                He    indicated           t h at       the    premises             would    be       open       until

4.00pm       (1600)         that       day       but w o u l d       close         at    that       t im e     until       all

football           supporters              had    left        the are a .

He    said     t h at      both       sets       of    supporters             were       welcome          and    t ha t     supporters

from     both       teams        were       already           in the         premises.              He    said     that

arrangements               had     been made             to    h av e    doormen          control             those    persons

wishing        to     enter        the      premises           and      he    did       not    anticipate             any    trouble.

I visited           the      premises           with PS Keenan,                   there          were       a s m al l      number        of

persons          inside        but      no    problems.              PS Keenan              informed Control                   that

premises          were       to     remain         open       until       4.00pm         (1600).

After      patrolling               Halifax         Road       to    ensure          all      serials          were      in p o s i t i o n ,

about      11.45am           (1145)          I returned             to H a l i f a x        R o a d at its            junction with

Southey          G r e e n Road.             In S o u t h e y       Green        R o a d at           this l o c a t i o n and

across       from        the W h i t e        Horse       Public          House         is a      'Thresher'             off-

l i c e nc e .      I noticed             that      the       premises          were        full        of L i v e r p o o l    football

supporters             who     were       buying         packs       of    beer         and      lager.         I went         into       the

premises          and       sa w    that      there were             only       two      female          assistants            serving

but    there       were        no    problems.                I returned             about        midday        and      noticed          that

the    number          of    persons          entering          the       off-licence                 were     being        controlled

and    limited           to a b o u t        six    persons          at a n y        on e     time.          One     shop assistant

was ma nning             and       locking         the    entrance             d o or    whilst          the    othere         was

serving          customers.               A queue         of a b o u t         fifteen           to     twenty       supporters            was

formed       up on          the     pavement           outside         and       whilst          I ha d the           premises under

observation              the       queue      remained          fairly           constant              at   that s o r t       of

number,           (The       premises           later         closed       about         2.00pm          apparently            having

sold     out      of     pac k s     of      lag e r     and    beer,          although           I cannot           confirm         the

reason       for       closing).              It was          around       twelve           midday          when     I also         noticed

that     the W h i t e         Horse         Public       House        doors         were        closed        due    to     the

premises          being        full.

There      were        approximately                one       hundred Liverpool                       fans     packed        outside           on

the    terracing             and     beer       garden         at    the       front        of    the       premises.           T hey were

al l   drinking             from     cans       and      bottles          apparently              purchased           from      the

Thresher          Off-Licence.                  Around         that       time       PC O s b o r n e        mentioned          to me

that     a youth            had     gone      into       a ladies          hairdressers                  shop       situated         above

the    shopping             precinct          near       to    the     Thresher             Off-Licence              and     ha d    to    be

ejected          after       requesting             the       staff       to    do      his      hair.         He    wa s    under        the

influence           of      dri n k .
Large       numbers       of L i v e r p o o l      supporters          were     arriving          in    private           cars

and    vans     and      parking       on     the    estate       r o ads     off H a l i f a x     Road.           As     the

supporters          walked       along        Halifax       Road       I noticed        that m an y           of    them were

drinking         from     cans    or    bottles.            Although          some     were    drinking             soft

drinks         I distinctly           recall        thinking       to m y s e l f      that    I had          never        in all

my    e x p e r i e n c e ■of w o r k i n g    and attending             football         matches            seen     so m n a y

people         consuming        intoxicating            liquor         in the     street.           Sometime             after

12.30pm         (1230)        I heard a        r adio      message       to     the    effect       that       a transit

van    had     driven away            from a shop after                 the     occupants          had       been

shoplifting.              I then       heard        that    the    vehicle        had     been      seen       travelling

along       Foxhill      Road     which        forms       a junction with Halifax                       Road       at     the

Wadsley Bridge                Railway       Station.

A fe w m i n u t e s      later       the     transit       van was         driven      on    to    the       car     park       of

the    White      Horse        Public       House     followed          by a P o l i c e      transit          va n

containing          Inspector          Robinson and           other         officers.

The    occupants         who     were       Liverpool        supporters           were       detained          and       placed

in the P o l i c e        transit       van.         I noticed          that     the    supporters             va n

contained a mattress                   in the        rear    which       wa s    surrounded             by    empty        beer/

lag e r     cans.

A    short      time     later    whilst         I wa s     speaking          to PS K e e n a n         outside          the

White       Horse      Public     House        a group       of a p p r o x i m a t e l y     twenty          youths        led

by one y o u t h         in    particular           started       to    sing     an    obscene          song.         I. w e n t

to    the      leader     wi t h PS K e e n a n       and    the       group     immediately             stopped

singing.          I warned         the y o u t h a b o u t        his    future        behaviour             and    there

were      no    further        problems        outside       these       premises         despite            many     of    the

youths         present        being    quite        obviously          affected        by i n t o x i c a n t s .

About       1.30pm       (1330)       I s aw PS D i x o n         who    was     in    charge       of S e r i a l         Number

41    in H a l i f a x    R o a d at    its      junction with Kilner                   Way.

PS Dixon         t o l d me     that    his      serial      were       keeping        a watching             eye     over-

Liverpool         supporters           who     were     buying         large     quantities             of    intoxicating
                                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                                   R272

liquor        from      the     off-licence              department              of    the      Gateway Supermarket.

These        premises         subsequently               sold        out    of    packs         and     bottles         of    b e er a n d

lager.

About        2.30pm      (1430)        I returned              to H a l i f a x        Road       near     to     its       junction

with Southey             Green       Road        where        I saw Chief              Inspector           Purdy.            Liverpool

supporters             coaches       were        n ow    parked        in H a l i f a x         Road     d o w n as         far    as      the

Pelican         crossing          just      below        this        junction.               The F i r e      Brigade         were

called        to a      c o a c h at       this       junction which                  wa s      leaking       diesel         fuel,          I

r e c al l    Chief      Inspector           Purdy           saying        his    rad i o       was     not w o r k i n g         very

well     but my         radio       wa s    working           efficiently              although          r e c e p t i o n was

sometimes             difficult        due       to     traffic        and       general          no i se .      There        were

large        numbers         of L i v e r p o o l       supporters           walking             down Halifax               Road

towards        Hillsborough,               many         of    them were           under          the    influence            of    d r in k

although         there        was    no     trouble.               It wa s       noticeable             t h at    all       those

heading         towards         Hillsborough                 appeared        to       be     in no      particular            hurry

despite         the     ground       b e i n g a te n m i n u t e s              walk        a w ay.

I a ls o      saw a group            of     forty        to    fifty        supporters             walking            in the

opposite         direction           away        from        the     ground.           On       speaking         to    them       one      of

their        number      indicated           that        their        coach       driver          had    allowed            them      to

alight        near      to    the    ground           but     ha d    driven          off       taking     the        match       tickets

with     him.          They     were       all    walking            back    to       the       coach    to      collect          their

tickets.

At 2.45pm             (1445)      there      were        still        lar g e     numbers          of    supporters               walking

towards         the     ground.            Customers           at     the    White           Horse      Public         House       were

leaving         in s m al l       pockets         and        I noticed           those          Liverpool         supporters               who

I ha d       spoken      to     earlier          regarding            the    singing             of an     obscene           song

making        their      way      down Halifax                Road.         They       appeared          to      be well

intoxicated             but     were       not    causing            any    problems.

About        t h at    time     I noticed             a group         of a p p r o x i m a t e l y       forty         or    fifty

Liverpool             supporters           walking           down     the    side          of    the    parked         co a c h e s
towards        the     ground.           They appeared                to    be w e l l       intoxicated              but      again

were     not     causing          any    problems.              I recall          mentioning            the      group         to

Chief     Inspector           Purdy       and       wondered          where       they       ha d    been     drinking.                  We

concluded         that       they       must    have       been       drinking          at    the     Wadsley          Bridge

Working        Mens     Club       which       is s i t u a t e d      in H a l i f a x       Road      near      to     its

junction         with       Doe    Royd       Lane    or    perhaps          one     of      the     public       houses            on

the    adjoining            housing       estates.

Throughout            the    day    leading          up    to    kick-off          time       it wa s       particularly

noticeable            that    large       numbers          of    supporters             were        drinking          from       cans

or    bottles         and    many       were    intoxicated.                 In f a i r n e s s ,       however,            with

those     exceptions              mentioned          I will          say    that     the      fans     were       well         behaved

although,in            many       cases       boisterous.

I was     surprised           that       those       supporters             heading          for     the    ground          after

2.30pm       appered         to    be    in no       particular             hurry       to    get     to    the       ground         even

up    to 2 , 5 0 p m    (1450).           Traffic          in H a l i f a x       Road whilst              busy       from around

11.30     am     (1130)       onwards          was    never          allowed       to     build       up a n d        cau se

serious        congestion           and       never       appeared          any worse           than       that       on a n or m a l

Sheffield         Wednesday             home    fixture.

At 3 . 0 0 p m    (1500)          I met       PS Dixon and             his       serial       number        41    in H a l i f a x

Road     with     the       intention          of    implementing                Phase       2 which        involved             that

serial       joining         the    South       Yorkshire             Police       coach        outside          the     ground           in

Penistone         Road North.                 The    remaining             two    serials           4 2 a n d 4 3 were; due

to    take     their        meal    break       at    that       time       at   Claywheels            Lane       Traffic

Department.             We    set       off    to w a l k       to    the    ground and              by t h i s       t im e     there

was    only      the    occasional             football          supporter           heading          for     the      ground.

Traffic        wa s    very       light       and    of a       loc a l     nature.           En-route           to    the       ground

I saw a        number        of    officers          near       to    the    Gate       Inn P u b l i c       House         in

Penistone         Road       North       speaking          to a g r o u p         of a b o u t       six    men who            were

obviously         intoxicated.                 Those       supporters            made        their     way along

Leppings         Lane       watched       initially             by    officers          in m y       company.            We      then
continued          along        Penistone              Road       towards       the    gr o u n d .

As    we    did    so       I heard a            r a d io    message       from a voice                I did          not    recognise

asking       for       th e    gates        to    be    opened.           Although          I was       unaware             of w h a t

was    happening              t he    caller        sounded         quite       panicky and             I remarked                to PS

Dixon       to    that        effect.            As we       approached Gate                0 to       the       ground        I heard

a    radio       message         directing             all    Officers          at    Claywheels             Lane       to a t t e n d

at    the    ground           immediately.

At    3.15pm        (1515)           we    entered          the    ground and          went       immediately                to    the

opening          between         the       North       stand and          the    Spion       Hop where                I saw

Superintendent                 Greenwood.               I saw       that       there       were    large          number          of

people       on    the        p i t c h at       the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end    of    the       ground and             I

assumed          that         Liverpool           supporters             had invaded         the       pitch.           I had          no

i d e a at       that         time        the    game       had   been     under       way    or       the    e x t e n t of      the

problem.

I asked Superintendent                           Greenwood          where       he w i s h e d     me       to    d ep l oy my men

and    he    indicated               the    playing          area    perimter          track       facing             the    N ot t s .

Forest       supporters               on    the S p i o n         Hop.

At    that       time         there        was    o n l y a h a n d f u l of         Police       Officers             on the          track

and    the N o t t s .         Forest           supporters          were       chanting          and    t a u n t i n g the

Liverpool          supporters.

Several          supporters               were    half-heartedly                attempting             to    climb          the

perimeter          fence.             I instructed                officers       to    spread          out       across       the

perimeter          track         facing          the    Spion       Hop.

Several          Notts.        Forest           supporters          were       screaming          at    me       to    clear       the

pitch       and    it w a s          evident        that      they       too    assumed          there       had       been a          pitch

invasion          by L i v e r p o o l          supporters.

pitch       from       the     opposite           end       shouting       abuse       towards          the       S p i o n Hop.            1'

deputed          one    officer            to    remove       him    but       the    youth       ran       off       back    towrds

the L e p p i n g s         Lane      stand where             I saw       he    was    detained             by o t h e r      Police
officers.             About       five          minutes        elapsed         before         I realised            that       the

situation            was       more         serious         than I had            first       envisaged and I noticed

t ha t    there       were       injured          persons            lying        on the        p i t c h at the L e p p i n g s

Lane      side       of    the    ground.              I attempted             to     c a l m the         shouting        No t t s .

Forest         supporters             by    pointing           out     that       there       were        injured        p e op l e    on

the      pitch       and       that         it    could       not s i m p l y       be     cleared.

The      taunts       by       the         Notts.       Forest supporters                   continued            then      suddenlya

large      number          of L i v e r p o o l        supporters            who     were       on     the      pitch     clearly

incensed            by the       taunts          ran     towrds        the     Spion Hop             in    response.            I

feared a            large     clash when               the     Liverpool            supporters             reached        the       Spion

Kop      but        officers          in    front              of    the S p i o n    Hop successfully                  u s h e r e d the

Liverpool            supporters             back a c r o s s          the      p i t c h to     the       Leppings        Lane        side

and a      large          cordon       of P o l i c e        officers          formed         across         the    width       of     the

pitch      to       prevent       further             problems         of    that        nature.           Whilst        all    this

was      taking       place       I did          not     hear       any     radio        messages          from     the     Police

control,            although          had any          been made            1' d o u b t    that       I would          have    heard

what      was       being     said         due    to     the    l e vel      of     noise       from       the     crowd.           I did

hear      Kenny       Dalglish             make       an a n n o u n c e m e n t      over      th e      ground        public

address             system       and       whilst              I could        not        make          out      what     he    said        his

message             seemed       to    have       a    calming        effect         on the      Notts.          Forest

supporters.

Liverpool            supporters             were       dismantling             the       advertising             hoardings            to

use as         stretchers             and       it w a s     then      that       the      seriousness             of    the

situation            became       known          to    the     Notts.        Forest         supporters             and myself              for

that     matter           when    several             bodies        were     brought          from        the    Leppings           Lane

stand      direction             towards          the      Spion       Kop.

About      4.23pm          (1625)          an announcement                  was     made      that        the    match      wa s      to    be

abandoned.                In the       absence           of a n y      other         instructions               I caused Serial

number         41    to    remain          in    position           until      the       bulk     of      the    Notts.        Forest

supporters            had     left         the S p i o n       Kop.         Following           that       I anticipated               that
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       R272

             there       would     be P u b l i c       Order      problems          outside        the      ground       so    took     the

             decision        to    revert          to P h a s e    3 and       took     the      serial       from       the    ground     on

             foot    along        Penistone             Road North        towards        Halifax            Road,        On    that

             journey although                 I was       subject        to    numerous          comments       about          the P o l i c e

             causing       the     deaths          of    supporters           by o p e n i n g    the       gates    I saw        no    signs

             of    trouble.            At    6.30pm       (1830)      I went         to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane       with     Serial

             41    and    subsequently              returned        to M a i n       Street       Police       Station          by P o l i c e

             coach       going     off       duty at       7.30pm        (1930).

             In    respect        of     radio      communications,               although          my      radio    was       working

             throughout           the       day    I did     not    have       the     benefit       of a n     extension              speaker

             and    in s i t u a t i o n s        where    there      was      noise      from      traffic         or    supporters           I

            On S aturday             9th    April        1988       I was          on    d u t y at F A C u p        semi-final             match

            between Liverpool                    and Nottingham                    Forest       at    Hillsborough.

            My    duties        concerned           the       supervision                of    serials        responsible             for    the

            Policing           of    the    turnstiles              at       the    Leppings          Lane     end    of       the    ground

            designated              for    the     Liverpool             supporters.                 I attended           at    both

            briefings           in    respect           of    the m a t c h a n d             received        no    specific

            instructions              on    chanelling              fans       into       the       turnstiles        and       cannot

            recollect           any       instructions              being          given       regarding           fans    arriving

            without        tickets.

            1 took        up    position after                  the      pre-match             briefing        on the          forecourt         area

            outside        the       turnstiles              in L e p p i n g s         Lane.        I believe        there          were    two

            Police        Officers          manning           each       turnstile.                 From     the    outset       those

            officers           were       searching           fans       arriving             for    th e    match and          in    particular

            were     removing             any    banners           or    sticks          which       could     be    construed          as

            dangerous           and       cans     of    drink.              Initially          the       arrival     of       fans    were      slow

            and     there       were       no    problems           for       the       officers          on the     turnstiles.

            Other     officers             were     on       duty       on   that        forecourt          area     on    general          public

            order     duties          but       there        was    no       channelling             of     fans    into       the    turnstiles

            or    cordons           either       by P o l i c e m e n        or     barriers          to     filter       the    fans       in

            Leppings           Lane.        Th e    turnstiles               were        individually marked                    and    on
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       RH72A

arrival       fans          were       making          their          own way       through          the       gates       to    the

turnstiles             although             where          possible          I assisted,             as    did       other       officers,

by   directing              fans       to    the a p p r o p r i a t e         turnstile             queues.

I was       unaware          of a n y        specific             arrangements             in h a n d          to    question          or

search       fans a r ri vi ng               without             tickets       but       any    f ans w h o          appeared          to       be

tlcketless             or    loitering              on      the       forecourt          area were             questioned             as       to

whether       or       not    they          had     tickets.                Those    that       were       not       in    possession

of a    ticket          were       told        to      l e av e       the    area    and       those who             were       standing

around       with       tickets             were       encouraged             to    enter       the       ground.

Whilst       that       was       an    easy          task       in t h e     early       part       of    the       afternoon             it

became       more       difficult              as      the       numbers       of    supporters                arriving          increased

progressively                towards           kick-off               time.

I noticed          that       large          numbers             of    fans    smelled          of    intoxicants                and       I

recollect          two       or    three          occasions             turning          away    fans          who       were    so

intoxicated             that       they were                being       supported          by    friends.                 One    officer

arrested a youth                   for       drunkenness.

During       the       last       half       hour          or    so    before       kick-off          time          up    to 3 . 0 0 pm

(1500)       the       forecourt             area          became       considerably more                      congested             although

it w a s     still          possible           fo r me           to    stand       and    direct          f an s     towards          the

appropriate             turnstiles                .        In    particular          I recollect                a    large       queue

gathering          at       one    set       of       turnstiles             whilst       a much          smaller          queue       wa s

gathered          at    another             set       of    turnstiles             giving       access          to       the    same       area

of   th e    ground          beyond          the       turnstiles             entrances.              I was          able       to    direct

fans    from       one       queue          to a n o t h e r          without       any    fears          of    injury          to m y s e l f

or   the     fans.           I have          seen          television          shots       of    the       scene          outside

turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s         Lane          this y ear         and    I can sa y            that       the

situation          in       1988       bore       no       comparison          to w h a t       I saw          on    the

television.                 Although           queues            at    the    turnstiles             in    1 98 8 w e r e        heavy          and

there       was    a    lot       of    shoving,                pushing       and    eagerness             to ge t         into       the

ground       1 did          not    see       any       real       signs       of    danger       to a n y o n e           in t h e     qu e u e s .

              By 3.00pm        (1300)       most     of    the L i v e r p o o l    supporters         had    entered     the

               ground,       only    those     persons        arriving       after       that   time      were      outside     at

               kick-off       time.

               I actually went          into       the     seating      area       of   the W e s t    S t a n d at    kick-off

               time    and    noted    that     al l      seats    in th e     stand were           occupied.

               I remained        in t h a t    general        area     throughout         the   game      and    returned       to

               the L e p p i n g s   Lane     area     after      th e m a t c h    u n t i 1 all     f ans   had     dispersed.
