EVIDENCE OF POLICE SERGEANT TREVOR BICHARD




                     1
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    It is very good of you to come and
 2       see me.     I have, of course, read your evidence both at the
 3       Taylor Inquiry and at the inquest.       There are one or two
 4       things that I would like to try to clarify a little bit.
 5        I am sure you have had a chance to read through the
 6       evidence you gave on those two occasions?
 7   A   Yes, sir.
 8   Q    It has been a long time now and it must be quite difficult
 9        for you to remember.    One of the things I am interested in
10        is this question of the malfunction - if that is the
11       correct word - of camera 5.       You know what I mean by
12       camera 5, the one mounted by the scoreboard.       If I can
13       remind you of what you said to Lord Taylor.       You told him
14       there had been a problem and Mr. Holdswurth had been
15       working on it that day.     I am referring to page 43.         You
16       said that on that particular day the quality had been
17       improved.    It was not up to the mark but it was a lot
18       better than it had been.     "We were getting pictures.         That
19       is the best way of describing it."       I think that is the
20       main thing that you said about the quality of the pictures
21       on that occasion.     Can you just expand to me what was
22       wrong with the pictures?
23   A   The monitor in the control room I would describe         as being
24       misty or foggy.     What had been happening was that the
25        quality of the picture ---
26   Q   Just to stop you.     I will get the pictures of the screens
27        in the control room.     (Indicating)   There we are.     When
28        you are talking about the monitor, what are you talking
29        about?
30   A   The numbers above them represent the camera, and         the
31        monitor at the Leppings Lane end is there.
32   Q   That is on continuously?
33   A   Yes.
34   Q   Showing whatever it is camera 5 is pointing at?
35   A   Yes.
36   Q   As I understand it, if you want to transfer what         is being
37        seen on that to one of these two, you can do that by
38        flicking a switch.     Was it one of these things here?


                                       2
 1   A   That is right.     There is actually a selection system for
 2       the consequential pictures.       You select a particular tape.
 3   Q   So when you are talking about a monitor not being very
 4       good, you are talking about the number 5 screen, under
 5       number 5?
 6   A   That is right.
 7   Q   Not what you see on here?
 8   A   No.
 9   Q   Now, what was the problem with the number 5 screen, if
10       that is right?
11   A   The quality of the picture was misty - foggy, and the
12       standard of the picture would get worse the longer the
         screen was on.      I would describe it as you would alter the
E
15
         contrast on a television;
         effect.
                                         a whitening and darkening
                     In this case it was a whitening of the screen.
16   Q   Is this the same thing as flare?
17   A   Very   similar to flare.
18   Q   That had been worse previously, had it?
19   A   Yes, the problems had occurred over a number weeks.
20       Certainly in the morning when I arrived it was very bad.
21       Roger Holdswurth improved it to a workable level but
22       certainly not to the standard it could have been.
23   Q   Was it as good as these - 1, 2, 3 and 4?
24   A   No.
25   Q   No. 2 was the colour one?
26   A   No. 3 is the colour one.
27   Q   I thought it was n o . 2.
28   A   It is one of those rare things that I feel confident
29       about, but I am not going to bet on it.
30   Q   Thisis the plan.     Camera 1 is this   one here;      the West
31       stand looking towards Leppings Lane.       Right?
32   A   I am   not sure on numbering.
33   Q   I have known that as no. 1.That is the        no. 2.     This is
34       the colour one.      That is the colour one, isn't it, on the
35       South stand?
36   A   That is certainly the coloured monitor, but my
37       recollection was the colour monitor was no. 3.
38   Q   Thisone is no. 4.     That has always   been referred to as
39       no. 4 as far as I am concerned, Penistone Lane.          This


                                       3
 1       black and white one here is referred to as no. 3. May be
 2       you think those two are interchangeable.      I do not think
 3       it matters very much for present purposes.     Can we refer
 4       to this one, the colour one?
 5   A   Shall we refer to it as "the colour one"?
 6   Q   I am calling this one no. 2 and this one no. 3.     That is
 7       the other one in the South stand.     You say that the
 8       quality of what you were seeing on no. 5 screen was not as
 9       good as you were seeing on no. 1 screen?
10   A   That is right.
11   Q   When it got transferred to these recording monitors, was
12       there any difference then between the quality of the
13       picture that you were getting from say, camera 1 and
l«
15   A
         camera 5?
         I am not really sure of the answer to that.     My only
16       definite recollection is looking at 5 and dealing with 5,
17       and the tendency would be to switch to what you wanted to
18       record, but I would not really concentrate on what was
19       shown.
20   Q   On the recording monitor.     You would be looking at the
21       original screen?
22   A   The two monitors there are useful for people who are
23       working in the control room to be able to see.      To see the
24       top ones you would have to stand right back to see i t .
25       Certainly the lower monitor was more accessible.      Nobody
26       working on the front row could actually see.
27   Q   I see.   So far as I can make out from what you are saying,
28       it was more a problem with the screen than the camera.         Is
29       that right?
30   A   I do not really know the technical answer to that, but
31       certainly Roger Holdswurth was working on the camera in
32       the morning of the event.     Where the actual problem lay, I
33        cannot really answer that.
34   Q   So far as seeing what was going on on the terraces, on the
35       West terrace, everybody in the control room as far as I
36        can see would have been looking out of the window?
37   A   Yes.
38   Q   They would not be looking at your screen 5, would they?



                                       4
 1    A   The tendency, because they have not got such a good view
 2        inside the ground, they were quite happy to look through
 3        the windows.    The only time there was an interest in the
 4        monitors was if the fans were doing anything.
 5    Q   As if somebody said "There is something going on over
 6        there, will you train on that?"
 7    A   More along the lines of if something      washappening outside
 8        the ground I would draw attention to it.
 9    Q   What do you mean by that?
10    A   On Penistone Road.
11    Q   What I am calling camera 4?
12    A   I would then draw the attention of whoever was in          charge.
      Q   Because you are the eyes for outside      the    ground;   they are
il        the eyes for inside the ground.       Others in the control box
15        would be eyes for inside the ground.       Is that the correct
16        way of putting it?
17    A   I would say responsible across the board for five minutes
18        which included both inside and outside the ground.             People
19        at the front had the advantage of being able to see the
20        live action through the windows.       My view was quite
21        restricted from the back of the control box which was
22        rather small at that time, and it was limited usually to
23        the monitors.    Where you actually stood at the back was
24        elevated.    When I am stood up my eyes are all level with
25         the monitors at the front.       The picture does not give you
26         the correct perspective there..
27    Q   You   were asked at some stage - I think        both at the inquest
28         and Lord Taylor's inquiry - as to whether when you first
29         noticed something was wrong in pens 3 and 4, when you saw
30         people climbing out, whether you saw that all through the
31         windows or on the screen, and you said you could not
32         remember?
33    A    That is right.
34    Q   I do not suppose you can remember more          clearly now?
3.5   A   Not   with any confidence to say to you,        hand on heart, that
36         I positively saw it on the screen.       From the position I
37         was in at the back of the control room makes it very
38         difficult to look out of the windows. I had to make a



                                        5
 1       conscious effort to bend down, and my eyes are therefore
 2       using cameras.
 3   Q   I wonder if I can try to get your help as to where these
 4       various cameras were focusing.     If need be we can look at
 5       your exhibits TB1 and 2.    First of all, can you help me
 6       with this.   Do you know which of the monitors TB1 comes
 7       from and which TB2 comes from?
 8   A   They relate to the tape players rather than actual
 9       monitors.
10   Q   Do you know which is TB1 or 2?
11   A   No.
12   Q   It might be either of these two?
     A   No, I cannot say for certain.
i«
15
     Q
     A
         You do not now remember which is which?
         Not which one the tape came out o f .
16   Q   TB1 up to 143 0 is camera 1 and is showing scenes outside
17       Leppings Lane.   Is that right?
18   A   Right.
19   Q   From 143 6 TB1 goes inside the ground.    It is the kop end
20       and it is the colour camera which I am calling camera 2.
21       At 1458 that camera swings on to the West terrace and you
22       see scenes at that end and you are moving the camera about
23       and zooming it and so on.    From that moment I would say
24       you are concentrating on operating that colour camera?
25   A   Yes.
26   Q   And that tape ends at 4 minutes past     3?
27   A   Yes.
28   Q   So far as that tape is concerned, it is camera 1 up to
29       143 6, and camera 2 thereafter.    First down the kop end and
30       then at 2 minutes to 3 you obviously notice something at
31       the inside and you swing the camera round to focus on the
32       Leppings Lane terraces?
33   A   Right.
34   Q   TB2.   Until 2 minutes past 3 that is focusing on what is
35       happening outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, and it is
36       on time lapse, and then clearly camera 1 at 1502:53 goes
37       inside the ground.     There are clearly shots taken by
38       camera 5, and they are shots of the perimeter fence and
39       people climbing out.     It appears to be focused in one


                                      6
    1       position.     That is to say, you are not moving it about or
 2          manipulating it in any way.      It is on time lapse.     Looking
 3          at it on the monitor, it is pretty poor quality and you do
 4          not get very much help from it.      At 1525 it changes    to
 5          what I have called camera 3, the other black and white
 6          camera. It is long range shots of the goal from that
 7          camera.     It is on time lapse, of poor quality and ends at
 8          1535 or 1534.     I would like to show you that in due
    9       course.     I would like your confirmation that I have got
10          that right.
11                  There is one other piece of information that I should
12          tell you.      That is that between 1418 and 1422 roughly
            camera 5 is focusing on what I think is probably pen
e
15
            number 2 but again you can probably help me about that.
            There was an incident which you referred to in your
16          evidence before Lord Taylor of somebody apparently
17          misbehaving down the front.      It was when Mr. Mike Robley
18          was in the box.    You clearly bring the camera down on to
19          that pen and we can see close ups of what is going on in
20          that pen.    There is nothing else recorded from that camera
21          until 1502, so there is nothing recorded between something
22          like 1423 and 1502.      Can you help me where that camera 5
23          was and what you would be seeing on screen 5 during that
24          time?     What I want to know is would it have remained - did
25          it remain - where you left it at 1423 on pen 2?         Or did
26          you bring it into some other position?      Or can't you
27          remember?
28      A   I would not be able to remember that.     You hit on a
29          significant point in your summary there in that when the
30          camera is moving, panning, tilting or zooming in, quite
31          clearly I am in control of the system.      If, from the time
32          you have mentioned, camera 5 is not being recorded, it is
33          because I am looking at another camera and recording other
34          events which most probably between 23 0 and 3 o'clock are
35          events on the rear of Leppings Lane.
36      Q   Until you are concentrating on the kop end just before 3
37          o'clock.     So may be you cannot answer the question.
38          Perhaps when we look at the bit between 1418 and 1422 you
39          can see whether or not you think it would have remained in


                                         7
 1         that position, or whether you would have put it somewhere
 2         else.     You cannot remember particularly where it was, is
 3         that the position?     You cannot really remember now where
 4         it was?
 5   A     No, there is no way that I could recall where that was.
 6   Q     What I would call camera 3, the other black and white          one
 7         on the South stand, that so far as I can see does not come
 8         into play down on the Leppings Lane end until 1525.        Can
 9         you remember where that would have been up until that
10         time?     There was a problem at the kop end just before       3
11         o 'clock?
12   A     I recollect certain problems on the kop.       The timing of
           it, I thought, was a little bit earlier on than that.
il
15   Q
           Certainly there had been problems.
           You have got the colour camera on that end at 143 6 until
16         1458.     I would rather expect that the black and white
17         camera, which I gather was a very powerful one, would have
18         been concentrated on the kop end while that trouble was
19         going on, but I do not know.
20   A     It is 1518, when the one you refer to as camera 3, starts
21         to move.     It would have remained.   The position you first
22         see it move since the last time it was activated would not
23         relate to the events on the kop when we are using a colour
24         camera to monitor the same area.
25   Q     I am not sure that quite answers the question.       The first
26         time that camera 3 - that is the black and white one at
27         the kop end or South stand - can be identified as coming
28         into use is when TB2 shows it coming round and fixing on
29         the Leppings Lane end.     Where do you think it was before
30         then?     Do you think it would have been focusing that end
31         or do you think it would have been on the kop?
32   A     As soon as that camera starts moving, it moves from      the
33         kop down to Leppings Lane.
34   Q     I do not think you can see it focusing on the kop.       All
35         one sees is that it suddenly starts recording at the
36         Leppings Lane end.
37   MR.   BONE:     I think that is right, Sir Murray.
38   A     We are saying the camera has been moved prior torecording
39         and then switched on.


                                         8
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
 2   A     Without that as guidance, I cannot answer that.
 3   Q     I will tell you why I said this.     Mr. Holdswurth has told
 4         me - and I think there isn't any doubt about this - that
 5         in the club control room there is a monitor which enables
 6         people in the club room to switch over to what you are
 7         seeing on some of your screens.      I am not sure whether it
 8         was all of them or four of them.
 9   A     I have never had any involvement with the club system.
10         The only thing I can say with any certainty is that I or
11         the staff in the control room have no access to any of the
12         pictures.
     Q     That I do know.     I understand that.   What Mr. Holdswurth
il         says is that he was from time to time looking at what the
15         position was inside the ground by turning on to your
16         cameras, and specifically at about the time gate C opened
17         at 1452 he looked inside the ground at the Leppings Lane
18         terraces.    He    says he could see - and it is not clear
19         whether it is      from cameras 5 or 3 (he seems to think it
20         might have been either or both)      - that pens 3 and 4 were
21         overcrowded.       That is what he now says.   He has never said
22         it until quite recently.
23   MR.   COOK:    I am sorry - what time was that?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Probably from about 1452 I would
25         say.     I do not know whether you can help me about this.
26         There is no record of that, so the question is whether
27          cameras 5 and 3 may have been focusing on that end so that
28          he could see something.     I do not know whether you can
29          help about that?
30   A      Unfortunately, it is just something I could not answer.
31          This is the first I ever heard that he had access to the
32          pictures we were seeing.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think the best thing probably
34          is to show him.      I think we could show him the bit.     What
35          are you focused on at the moment?
36   MR.    BONE:    We are on TB1 and 2 at 1455.    I think we need to
37          see TB2 really.




                                            9
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, the 1418 bit.   I think we
 2         could reel back to 1418 and start from there.       (Video
 3         played)    We are looking at TB2 at the moment.
 4   MR.   BONE:     I am going back to 1418 on this tape.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      We are going to start at 1418.
 6         This is the kop end and this is the black and white camera
 7         presumably?
 8   A     Ye s .
 9   Q     Which I am calling camera 3?
10   A     That is right.
11   Q     (1418:3 9) This is camera 5, isn't it.
12   MR. BONE:   Yes.
     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You do not know which pen you are
c
15   A
            looking at?
           That is what I would refer to as pen 2.
16   Q     Pen 2.    That is what I would have thought.   And you     can
17          see a bit of pen 3 in the background?
18   A     Yes.
19   Q     This is the incident, as I understand it, where it was
20          thought that one of these gentlemen was misbehaving?
21   A     Yes.
22   Q     I don't think there is any sign of    it in thepicture?
23   A     No, an incident took place    and acamera was put    on to
24          monitor the behaviour.
25   Q     These are quite good pictures.     Of course, it is a bigger
26          screen and we can show it to you on a smaller one if you
27          want to, but how does that compare with what you would be
28          seeing on your screen 5?
29   A     It gives you the glare you get off the light surfaces.           It
30          was more exaggerated than that.     Again, the camera is not
31          moving.
32   Q     No, but it does move.     We have already seen it move,      I
33          think.   Now, you could probably identify somebody at       that
34          distance, couldn't you?
35   A     Yes, that is what the camera was there for.
36   Q     That is 1420:25.     Is that the maximum zoom that you have
37          got?
38   A     I wouldn't know the answer to that.
39   Q     You are clearly still manipulating it, aren't you?


                                        10
 1   A     Yes.
 2   Q     That is 14:20:46.     You are still moving at 14.21:12.    So
 3         what you are saying is what you would see on your screen 5
 4         would not be quite as good as what might be seen on the
 5         monitor?
 6   A     Monitor 5.
 7   Q     The monitor which is recording this?
 8   A     I cannot give you an answer about the quality of the
 9         monitor.
10   Q     Looking at the quality of this tape, is it not too bad, is
11         it?
12   A     No, no;     it is a reasonable quality.   It highlighted
           obviously that a larger screen does give the allusion that
E
15
           the standard of picture is a lot higher.
           is probably half size.
                                                         Bear in mind, it


16   Q      Yes.     We can look at it on a smaller screen. Now   we come
17         back to the kop end. (14.23:40) What I     would like to know,
18         if you can remember, is would you have      left camera 5 in
19         the position that we have just seen it, or would you have
20         moved it somewhere else and just left it parked, or can't
21         you say?
22   A     It would be difficult for me to say with any certainty.
23         What I could say is that it would be unusual for me to
24         want to move it.     I would have just left it there because
25         I am moving on to concentrating on another incident.
26   Q      Yes, that is what I would have expected.Anyhow,       we are
27         now on the kop end.
28   MR.    BONE:    Shall we now go on to 1502?
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
30   MR.    BONE:    I will fast forward to 1502.
31   A      Can I just ask a question about that?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes.
33   A     Between now and 1502, that camera stays recording that ---
34
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      No, it goes outside Leppings Lane.
36         Would you like just to switch it on.      It is 143 5 now and
37          these are scenes outside Leppings Lane.      It stays at this
38         end until 1502.
39   A      Thank y o u .


                                         11
 1   MR. BONE:       I will now advance to 1502.     We start at 15.02:40
 2         which is outside Leppings Lane again.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Now you go inside again.
 4          (15.02:57)    This is very curious.      Is that an example of
 5         flaring, that very white ---
 6   A     My description of flaring is when you have a very bright
 7         light on screen which means the picture will lose it.        It
 8         could be from a bright light or a reflection off shirts.
 9   Q     But it was very light when it first started on that?
10   A     Yes.
11   Q     These pictures are of very poor quality.
12   MR.   COOK:     This is slow motion, isn't it?
     A     That is right.     This is not what I am seeing in real time.
i!
15
     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:
     MR.   BONE:
                                       No, I know.
                     This is what is called freeze frame, isn't it?
16   A     It was an extended play system on the camera which
17         multiplied it six times.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think I am right in saying that
19         from now on - and we had better perhaps run this through -
20         the camera remains in the same position?
21   A     Yes.
22   Q     In fact, because you are manipulating the other camera,
23         the coloured o n e .
24   MR.   BONE:     This camera is in a different position now than it
25         was the last time we saw it.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        At 14.22?
27   A     Yes.
28   Q     This is pen 3, I think, isn't it?
29   A     Yes.
30   Q     Can you remember in what circumstances you switched it
31         from wherever it was before to this position?
32   A     No, not really.
33   Q     You do not know.       You cannot remember where it was before?
34   A     No.     Quite clearly from the video, I had been operating a
35         camera looking up Leppings Lane and somebody saying
36         something or my attention is drawn to want to record
37         events in the terrace area of Leppings Lane.
38   Q     Yes, and particularly the perimeter fence?
39   A     Yes.


                                          12
 1   Q     At some stage you swivel camera 5 on to that from wherever
 2         it has been before?
 3   A     At the beginning of the sequence there you actually saw me
 4         starting to move the camera.
 5   Q     Oh, did we?
 6   A     And actually it swung about quite a lot and went out of
 7         focus.
 8   Q     Can we go back to that.
 9   A     That suggests to me that I had just started to move it
10         then and was setting the pictures up.         (15.03:10)   There,
11         I am zooming in and coming out and trying to get in focus.
12   Q     Yes.    Where do you think it was before?
     A     Can you just run it back.
t:
15
     MR.
     A
           BONE:    Yes.   Running back to 15.02:50 again.
           The first shot there is an overview on the terraces.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is it possible that camera 5 had
17         been looking on giving       an overview of the terraces before
18         you moved it on to this?
19   A     It is quite possible.
20   Q     Possible.     That would mean that after the events that we
21         saw at 14.22 you must have put the camera somewhere else?
22   A     Moved it from looking at the four in the pen, yes.
23   MR.   BONE:    (15.07:49)   This   is about where we stopped before.
24   A     It is possible there, the first view we get is this
25         swinging across, that something occurs on Leppings Lane
26         and I start to move the camera to look at those events and
27         then start the recording. In other words, the camera could
28         still be settled down.        I just really cannot give you an
29         answer with any degree of certainty about where the camera
30         would b e .
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You do not have any recollection of
32         it?
33   A      It was obviously necessary for me to get the camera in
34         position to what I am seeing         on pen 3, which suggests to
35         me it was not already on pen 3 otherwise I could have just
36         left it there and recorded events.        Again, the first shots
37         that you get are just zooming in and out, and it is in and
38         out of focus as well.        Again, the shots, if you think
39         about pen 2 earlier, were close up of people in there.           By


                                           13
 1       just moving it on to pens 3 and 4, it is then going to
 2       create the problem that I am going to have to re-focus,
 3       readjust the picture, to get it right, because I have
 4       moved from what would have been pen 2, or what had been
 5       happening in pen 2, to the bigger picture on pens 3 and 4.
 6   Q   Am I understanding you correctly then, that having seen
 7       this now, what it suggests to you is that between 1424 and
 8       1502 when you start to manipulate camera 5 again, it was
 9       in the same position as it was at 1424, or can't you say?
10   A   I cannot give you a positive answer about that.
11   Q   This bit of film from 1502 to 1525, was made up into a
12       separate clip for the purpose of the inquest.         It was
13       shown to the jury just before you gave evidence. Do you
L
15   A
         remember that?
         No.
                              I don't know whether you do?


16   Q   Have you got the transcript of your evidence at the
17       inquest?    It is page 80.     (Produced)    If you would just
18       look at the top of that page.        The coroner says:
19              "The film we saw this afternoon of the Leppings Lane
20              end which came from what I have called camera 1 - I
21              don't know the camera number ---- "
22       You say:
23              "I call it camera 5."
24   A   Yes.
25   Q          "The one beneath or near the police box?"         (A) "Yes".
26              (Q) "That scene began at 1502.       This is what we have
27              just been looking at?"       (A) "Yes, sir."   (Q) "Where
28              was that camera looking before 1502 as far as you can
29              recollect?"     (A) "My recollections are that the
30              particular camera had been faulty, and in fact you
31              saw some of the problems that occurred.        You were
32              getting what is called flare.        It is the reflection
33              of light coloured objects, and you lose the picture.
34              The camera was not really being used as much as it
35              would normally have been because of the substandard
36              pictures.     It was just left in position. That is why
37              the picture never really moved at all, because it was
38              set and left in that position."



                                        14
 1       Does that help you at all?      That is, in effect, what you
 2       have been saying to me this afternoon, I think, isn't it?
 3   A   Yes, really.       That really covers exactly what I have been
 4       saying.
 5   Q   When you were saying you saw some of the problems that
 6       occurred, was that the bit that I was referring to when I
 7       drew your attention to it just now, that rather light
 8       coloured stuff?
 9   A   Talking about flare?
10   Q   Yes.
11   A   Yes, that is right.
12   Q   Or was there something else that you had in mind?
     A   Not, it was a very sunny day;       a very bright day, and all
il       reflection off any light coloured objects, white shirts
15       etc, caused problems.
16   Q   Then you   go on:
17              "That is what I am coming to.     Given that it started
18              at 1502, let us assume I am right on that time.          Was
19              that the time you moved it and located it and then
20              left it to take that shot?"     You say:    "No, that
21              probably would have been done before that."       (Q)
22              "Would it have been recording before that?"        (A)
23              "Yes."   (Q) "So there ought to be a film of it prior
24              to that?"     (A) "I would have thought so, yes."        (Q)
25              "Of that same scene?"    (A) "Yes."
26       Then the Coroner says they have looked and they cannot
27       find it, and indeed it is not there.         What you are saying
28       in that passage is slightly contradictory to what you have
29       just told me, namely, that when you switch it to looking
30       over pen 3, that is the first time that you operated that
31       camera.    Do you follow?
32   A   Right.
33   Q   What you   appear to be sayinghere     isthat     you think you
34       must have operated the camera alittlebefore          thepictures
35       we have just seen, do you follow?
36   A    I shall need to look at this because it is somewhat
37       confusing, sir.




                                        15
 1   Q   I think what you told the Coroner may have been mistaken.
 2       Just read it through. Read through from the top of the
 3       page to yourself again.     (Pause)
 4   A   Can I just work it down?
 5   Q   Yes.
 6   A   Quite clearly, the initially questions are establishing
 7       that we are referring to camera 5, Leppings Lane Terrace.
 8        (Q) "So where was the camera looking before 15 02 as far as
 9       you can recollect?"    (A) "My recollections are ... " I
10       don't really answer the question, do I?
11   Q   No.
12   A   Then I go on about flare.
     Q   You do say it was just left in that position?
e
15
     A   It was left in that position at 1502.      "Given that it
         starts at 1502, let us assume that we are right at the
16       time.   Was that the time you moved it and located it and
17       left it to take that shot?"       Clearly from what we have
18       seen on there, I move the camera for certainly a few
19       seconds before it settles in that position, and it appears
20       to me that what I am saying is no, that would have been
21       done before.    In other words, the movement, before it
22       settles in the position,    I have done the moving round    and
23       decided where to put it.    If you like, I am talking
24       probably about the few moments before it settles rather
25       than perhaps from the previous half an hour.      Does that
26       make any sense.
27   Q   I don't know.   My own feeling is that    you may bemistaken
28       here because what we have just seen, as you have
29       confirmed, is the camera moving and focusing on this pen
30       3, the perimeter fence, and it then stays there.        As you
31       told me a little while ago, you thought that you had moved
32       it from its previous position into that, and that is
33       recorded.   What you appear to be saying here is that you
34       may have moved the camera before the shots we see
35       recorded, and that if you did do that there should be a
36       recording of it.    There isn't a recording of it.
37   A   Therefore, I wasn't using the camera.
38   Q   That is what I would have thought.     So do you now think
39       that you were probably mistaken in the bit between D to E?


                                      16
 1   A     I think the issue is I was probably confused by what was
 2         being said, and what I am trying to convey is that if I am
 3         using the camera, I would usually be recording that.          If
 4         you like, you see an incident ---
 5   Q     You would switch over to    record straightaway, would you?
 6   A     Yes, to record.    It is not impossible to be looking at an
 7         event without bothering to record it, if you like, to
 8         evaluate it.    What I think I am trying to convey there is
 9         that if it is recorded and there is movement of the actual
10         camera controls, you know,       I am using it, monitoring it;
11         if it is just static there       then I am doing   something else.
12   Q     I am not sure I quite follow this.        We know that from this
           time onwards you are operating the colour camera, and
e
15
           camera 5 is just part of that position, but you must have
           moved camera 5 from wherever it was before.           We can see
16         the actual movement.
17   A     Some of the movement, y e s .
18   Q     Before we get these shots.It seems         to me   as though what
19         you said to the Coroner here on this point is probably not
20         correct.   As the Coroner   says, we have looked and there
21         isn't any tape.    You say you would expect there to be tape
22         if you had moved it earlier?
23   A     Yes, if I was using the camera I would have expected it to
24         have recorded.
25   Q     I think that has cleared that up, don't you?
26   MR.   BONE:   I think it has, Sir Murray.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Perhaps we would like just to look
28         at the other tape, TB1.
29   MR.   BONE:   We have set this to run from 1455.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      If I can just tell you what the
31         sequence is - I have told you already, but I don't suppose
32         you will remember - up to 143 5 this shows scenes outside
33         Leppings Lane from camera 1.         At 1436 it goes inside the
34         ground, the kop end, in colour which I am calling camera
35          2, which is the one nearest you on the South stand?
36   A     That is right.
37   Q     And we will pick it up there and we will see what happens.
38          (14.54:55) It looks as though the camera is parked at this
39          time, isn't it?


                                           17
 1   A     Yes, there appears to be no movement in it.
 2   Q     Probably because you were concentrating on Leppings Lane.
 3   MR.   BONE:    Shall I fast forward.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes, you can for a minute or two, I
 5         think.       Still the same scene, isn't it.
 6   MR.   COOK:    That is the Leppings Lane terraces?
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         No, this is the kop end.
 8          (14.58:43)    Now you are swinging round, going through the
 9         North stand, and there you are coming round on to the
10         Leppings Lane end.      (14.59:04)     That is actually looking
11         at pen 2, I think, mainly, isn't it?
12   A     No, I think that's pen 4.
     Q     Pen 4, I am sorry.
e
15
     MR.   BONE:    We are looking into the gap which is represented by
           pen 5 before we get to pen 6.
16   A     (14.59:55)     I am following ChiefInspector        Mike   who has
17         just left the control box.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You are clearly operating this
19         camera now, aren't you?
20   A     Yes.
21   Q     And when you are operating it, I imagine your full
22         attention is devoted to it, is it?
23   A     Yes, that's right.
24   Q     (15.01:11)     Can you say whetherthat      ismaximum      zoom?
25   A     Yes, it is.
26   MR.    BONE:  (15.02:30) Camera moves to take scenes behind the
27         goal.    Long shot.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It finishes at 1503.    It is quite
29         plain that you are manoeuvring that camera right up until
30         the tape ends?      That is right, isn't it?
31   A     Yes, certainly we moved out to the centre of the centre              of
32         the goal at 15.02:30.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes.    Chris, we hadn't actually
34          looked at TB3 and TB4, have we, or have you?
35   M R . BONE:    N o , I haven't .
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It might be interesting to pick up
37          the start of those.
38   MR. COOK:      Does that continue on from the one we have just
39          seen?


                                           18
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What happened was that you forgot
 2         to replace the tapes, didn't you?
 3   A     That's right.
 4   Q     And you didn't replace them until 153 5, I think, and then
 5         you replaced both of them?
 6   A     Yes, that's right.
 7   Q     We haven't actually looked at those yet.    It might be
 8         quite interesting to see what we pick up on those at the
 9         beginning.
10   A     What I am interested about there is obviously we had times
11         displayed on our screen, and the accuracy of those times
12         in real terms and in relation to each other - obviously
           there are two tape    players, two time recording systems   - I
£
15
           am just wondering.     Certain events we would be able to
           identify a positive time may be from BBC or from other
16         factors, but it may well be that there's differences on
17         the time display.     What I am looking at there, for
18         instance, is just after 3 o'clock clearly the players are
19         actually playing the game.
20   Q     They went on until six minutes past?
21   A     Just before 3 o'clock you see the linesmen moving about
22         and the game is in progress.      But you wouldn't expect the
23         kick-off to start until 3 o'clock.     Some of the times
24         displayed on the videos may be inaccurate.
25   MR.   BONE:   It is clear   from the BBC coverage which we have got
26         that the matched kicked off at half a minute before 3 -
27         2 .59 :30 .
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I don't think you need bother about
29         that.   I think the times are pretty accurate.    They may be
30         half a minute out which is neither her nor there, is it.
31         Which is this, Chris?
32   MR.   BONE:   This one is TB3.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      That is camera 3 again, isn't it?
34   MR.   BONE:   Yes.   This is the black and white one on the South
35         stand starting at 15.35:30.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Apart from the fact that it is in
37         ordinary, proper time now in stead of time lapse, this is
38         the same as we were getting from this camera previously?
39   A     The one we were looking at previously was the colour one.


                                        19
1     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           Yes, I am sorry, in the      other tape.
2     A         The tape we have just seen.
3     Q         No, not the tape we have just seen. The tape we have          just
4               seen was the colour one.      This is a continuation of TB2
5               which at 1525 changed to camera 3, long range shots.           What
 6         is this?
 7    MR.  BONE: This is TB2 at 1514.
 8    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Yes, 1525 is what we want to get
 9              to.
10    A         That is the flare we talked about.
11    Q         Here you are. This is camera 3 on time lapse,and it goes
12              through I think with the camera fixed in that position
                until 1534 when it ends.      When we go back to TB3 we pick
14              it up again only not on time lapse.
15    A     Yes.
16    MR. BONE: That is TB2, and this is TB3.
17    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Which starts at 1535.
18    MR.       BONE:   Yes.   There are    some gaps between TB2 and TB3 for a
19              few minutes, because TB2 finishes at about 153 0, and this
20              one starts at about 153 5, and they both show the same
21         scenes.
22    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            Exactly the same scenes as we have
23              just seen. I think speed that on a bit, Chris, until          we
24              get a change of scene.       We will have to look at this at
25              more leisure, but for the moment I am interested in the
26               change of movement of the camera.
27    MR.        BONE:  It changes at 15.57:50 to your previous view of pen
28          3 .
29    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:That's               right, isn't it?
30    A         That's right, yes.
31    MR.       BONE:   The camera seems to      be moving a bit,   doesn't it, in
32             and out?
33        A    That is probably a problem with the tape.
 34       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  Have you any comment on the quality
 35              of that picture?     (15.58:20)
 36       A      That's of reasonable quality.
 37       MR.    BONE:   (15.59.30)  Back to camera 3.       Then outside the
 38              ground at 15.59:40.       This is Penistone Road, isn't it?
 39       A     That is right, yes.


                                                20
1     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I don't think we need trouble with
2               that one any more.   Let us look at TB4, shall we?
3     MR.       BONE:   One we have not seen before.
4     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: No.
5     MR. BONE:   TB4 starts at 15.34:52.         It is a colour camera.
6     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It is camera 2 again, isn't it?
 7    MR.       BONE:   You obviously moved the camera since we last saw it
 8              at 15 whatever?
 9    A         Yes.
10    Q         You are panning along the North stand here, going that way
11              towards the gymnasium?
12    A         Yes.

P
14
      Q         In fact, you are at the Penistone Road end of the ground
                now.    There is the ambulance coming at 15.35:40.
15               (15.36:30) This is the incident with the fans running
16               towards the Nottingham Forest end because of the things
17         they were chanting at them.
18    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  It seems to me pretty clear that
19               you have been operating this colour camera ever since the
20               moment you switched it over at 14.58.   Don't you think?
21    A         Yes, I mean the previous pictures show camera 5 set on the
22               fence and definitely not in use.
23    Q         And this one, camera 2, is being moved all the time, isn't
24               it?
25    A          Yes, unfortunately there is a void in recording.
26    Q          Yes, but I think it is probably safe to assume that in
27               that void you were operating this camera?
28    A    Yes.
29    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I don't know whether we need to
30               look at any more.
31     MR.       BONE:  I don't think we do, Sir Murray.     Unless you want
 32              to see some of it on a small screen.    Do you wish to
 33              pursue that?
 34       MR.    COOK: Are you saying the picture quality is worse on a
 35              smaller screen?
 36       A      You will appreciate that this is a larger screen and gives
 37               you a nice, perfect picture in this nice cold hindsight
 38               environment, but sat there on the day with the emotions



                                             21
1          and events taking place and other things that's going off
2          around you, it was a very, very busy control room.
3     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I quite appreciate that. What   I am
4          trying to get a picture of is what you yourself were
 5         concentrating on, and it looks to me as though you were
 6         concentrating on what was happening outside the turnstiles
 7         of Leppings Lane until shortly before 3 o'clock, and that
 8         you then switched to this colour camera at 1458 when you
 9         see things happening inside the ground, two, three or four
10         minutes later you switch to camera 5 on to the same thing
11         but seeing it from a different angle.    You leave camera 5
12         parked there for quite a considerable time and you are

I3
r4
           operating camera 2, the colour camera, for the next half
           hour or so?
15    A   Operating the colour one, yes.
16    Q   I will just read you something that Mr. Holdswurth said,
17         and I am referring to page 9 of the transcript of his
18         evidence the other day to m e :
19              "It was through experience and knowing the ground and
20              what usually did occur on this type of scenario, not
21              when the gate was opened obviously because that was
22              the first time that ever happened, but when the two
23              central pens which were the main attraction points
24              for fans, were full.    Normally, what would happen was
25              that they had a removable barrier that went across
26              the tunnel where they used to put stewards and
27              possible one or two policemen."
28         This is the important bit:
29              "It was when gate C was opened, and observing
30              primarily from cameras 3 and 5, that those central
31              pens were full.    Then, because I had no video tape to
32               record them, I had no facility to record those.
33               Primarily, what I am referring to here is the static
34               camera."
35          So he is saying he can see from cameras 3 and 5 that the
36          central pens were full.    We have not been able to see
 37         anything of the sort from what is recorded, and from what
 38         you have told me you do not recall really either of those



                                        22
      two cameras being focused on pens 3 and 4 from 250
      onwards?
A.    That is true.    That is   right, yes.    Could you just read
      the last part of what Mr. Holdswurth said there about the
       static camera.
Q     That is a reference to     the club camera, I think, but he
      says - and there is no     doubt that this is what he saying
      that he saw     on the police cameras 3 and 5, that   pens 3 and
      4 were full.      He hasn't said that until quite recently.
A     Can you just clarify that.      What Mr. Holdswurth is
      suggesting is that from the club system he has had access
      to the pictures from all five cameras?
Q     Yes. We know that he has got access to, at any rate, four
      of them.    I am not sure if he had to the colour one.
MR.   BONE:    He told us he could choose which one to watch.
A   So he would have to select?
MR. BONE:   Yes, he had a switch so he could choose.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       And he was able to choose camera      1,
      and was in fact looking at our camera 1 for some time.          At
       the bottom of page 14 I say:
            "Would this be right.   If one were to have a record
              of what camera 3 was doing in the ten minutes before
              3 o'clock, say, it would be focusing on the Leppings
              Lane terraces, would it?"   Answer:    "Whether it was
              focusing there all the time, or not, I do not know.
              It was just that when we looked at it they had swung
              the camera away and then swung it around to Leppings
              Lane and one of the shots was a fairly wide angle,       I
              would say about half zoom, which shows the central
              pen was quite full.   No 5 camera was parked in an
              area that you can see the central pens at a fairly
              wide angle.   It was taking the two.     It was not
              concentrating on one camera because, as I say, I had
              no control over the camera.      It was a case of
              switching between cameras."
       Then later on he says:
            "It was showing the build up of the crowd.         You could
              see that the central pens were full but there were
              spaces both this side of the pens and the far side."


                                     23
1             I have asked you about that and you have commented on it.
2             Although you cannot remember now precisely where those
3             cameras were, it doesn't look as though you agree with
4             what he is saying?
5     A       I am intrigued - and perhaps I have just not picked up the
 6            thread - he has got five monitors -- no, he has got one
 7            monitor and he switches.
 8    Q       That   is right.
 9    A       When   he says he couldcomparescenes   on camera 5 and
10            camera 3 it is by switching?
11    Q       Yes.
12    A        Again, the issue he has mentioned there about the wide
              view, and I think certainly within the transcript, we had

£
15
              passed comment about the wing pens being fairly empty.
              That is measured up to the volume of people outside as
16             well.
17    Q       Yes.   I mean,everybody    in the policecontrol box    could
18             see that pen 2 was pretty empty, and they could see that
19            pens 3 and 4 were pretty full.     Do you think there is
20             anything else, Chris?
21    MR.      BONE:  I don't think there is, Sir Murray, no.
22    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is there anything else that you
23             want to tell me?
24    A        There are just two things that have come to mind.       It is
25             on record that I consider that camera 5 does not give you
26             the ability to see how dense the crowd is because of its
27             position at a low angle looking across the heads of the
28             crowd.   It creates an illusion, not a 3-d picture.      You
29             are looking at it in two dimensions. If somebody is
30             suggesting they could judge density from that through
31             mathematics or some scientific technique, I am sure it
32              would not be an accurate way ---
33        Q    It doesn't seem to me it is any better than looking with
34              your eyes out of the window.
 35       A    That is quite true. You are getting the same effect.
 36       Q    From a slightly different angle.
 37       A    And again within transcript it says quite clearly, because
 38             I was asked, if you needed to get an accurate picture of
 39            the density, where would the camera have to be, and we are


                                           24
 1         talking about behind the goal looking down on the centre
 2         pens.
 3   Q     I follow that.
 4   A     The other thing is we did talk about comments during
 5         inquest, and I think it was page 8 0 we were referring to.
 6         What I was trying to convey to the inquest then was that
 7         if I am looking at events on a camera I would be recording
 8         it and I would expect a record to exist.      If it didn't
 9         exist, it is suggesting to me that either I haven't
10         switched the recorder on or I was doing something else.
11         Perhaps that is not quite as clear.       On first reading,
12         what I am saying is not quite correct.      Perhaps I am just
           not conveying what I was trying to say.

     Q     I think we have clarified that a bit now, where you think
           there should be some film about it.   I think you are
16         mistaken about that.   There isn't any?
17   A     No, that's right, there isn't any film.      What I am saying
18         is if I am looking at an incident, I would expect to be
19         recording it.
20   Q     Therefore, if there isn't a recording, you are not looking
21         at it?
22   A     Yes.   It is just that it doesn't come across at the
23         inquest.   I have not made myself clear at the inquest what
24         I actually meant.
25   Q     I think it is clear to me now anyway.
26   MR.   BONE:   I think the position would be if you are not
27         recording something then you are probably not looking at
28         it rather than definitely?
29   A      It is quite clear from events here that you look through
30          the times of events and incidents happening at Leppings
31         Lane, quite clearly the emphasis is what is happening at
32          that place;   that is where the problem was and that is
33        where I am watching.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    We could actually follow where your
35          attention is directed, I think, throughout this period
36          because you can see what the camera is doing?
37   A      Yes.




                                        25
 1   Q     The only question is what is happening to the cameras when
 2         you are not looking at them or not looking at the screens.
 3         Right, do we need to look at the small screen.
 4   MR.   BONE:     I think that is up to Mr. Bichard to say.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Do you want to look at the small
 6         screen?     My impression - I can tell you, comparing TB1 and
 7         TB2 on the big screen and on the small screen - is that on
 8         the small screen it is slightly darker and slightly better
 9         definition in a way, although, of course, it is not the
10         big picture, but it is actually slightly clearer.
11   A     Are you looking at it on an actual black and white monitor
12         as well.

     Q
     A
     Q
           Yes.
           It would be a clearer picture than a colour screen.
           I am afraid I still don't quite understand why what       you
16         see on screen 5 is less good than what we see on the
17         tapes.     You cannot really explain that?
18   A     There may be some technical explanation.
19   Q     You still think that is so.
20   A     I am just thinking there.     There is a suggestion by    Mr.
21         Holdswurth that there was not a fault with camera 5.
22   Q     No, he doesn't say that.     He said there was a fault but he
23         cleared i t .
24   A     Clearly, there must be some record of the fault being
25         there from previous weeks, and obviously there was a fault
26         because it was there first thing.
27   Q     There is no dispute that there was     a fault, and there
28         isn't any dispute that he came to rectify it on the
29         morning in question.     The only issue, I think, is he says
30         it was working perfectly afterwards;     you say it was
31         working, but it wasn't as good as it should have been?
32   A     Yes.    Again, when I looked at some   of the statements I
33         made, the fault that was on the camera, I think I
34         described somewhere that it was a progressive fault.        The
35         longer it is on, the fault actually gets worse, and Mr.
36         Holdswurth may well have seen it first thing in the
37         morning and considered that he had achieved a reasonable
38         picture there but the fault progressively got worse
39         through the day.


                                         26
 1   Q     What I think is being said now is that the footage which
 2         we can see from camera 5, and we have looked at a certain
 3         amount of it, doesn't show any significant difference
 4         between that camera and the other cameras, and I think you
 5         accept that?
 6   A     From what we have seen here, yes.
 7   Q     Apart from that flaring.
 8   A     Apart from the flaring, yes.          The actual video recordings
 9         are of a comparable standard.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes, you are right.   There we are.
11         I do not think there is anything else.
12   MR.   BONE:   I do not think so, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:


     MR.
           out?
           BONE:   I d o n't , n o .
                                        Do you want to bring anything else


                                       Thank you very much.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Thank you very much indeed.    We
17         will let you have a transcript of that in due course, and
18         if you find there is anything wrong or you have not made
19         yourself clear, you should let me know.
