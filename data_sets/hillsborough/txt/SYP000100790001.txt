MICHAEL       CHRISTOPHER           WALPOLE




POLICE       CONSTABLE        1669




HAMMERTON       ROAD     POLICE         STATION




I c o mmenced duty            at    the    Sh e f f i e l d    Wednesday            Football          Ground       at

9.45    a.m.    on Saturday,              15th April           1989,      and a 10.00                a.m.    briefing             took

place    in the North              Stand by Chief              Superintendent                  Duckenfield .             I was

under    the    su p e r v i s i o n    of Police         S e r geant        Chapman,           serial       1,    covering

track duties          t h roughout         the operation.                 B r i efing was             completed          at

approximately          10.20 a.m.             and I s u b s e q u e n t l y         took up a position                   on       the

track under          the N orth        Stand betw e e n           the     half way             line    and    the       Spion

Kop    end.     I usually           work      the    same      duty      for      all S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

home    games       and I have w o r k e d many                se m i - f i n a l s    at      the    ground       du r i n g my

14 years Police            Service.            I usually           take      up     the     same      position          as

stated       for all matches.

I noticed       that     a few         fans    had entered             the Spion            Kop by      11.40 a.m.                and

there was       a constant             trickle       of   fans        a r r iving      after         this    time       again       on

the Spion       Kop     (Notts         Forest       fans).

Meal    was    taken     at    approximately              1.15        p.m.     on     the      direction          of    Police

Sergeant       Chapman        and      this    was    a hot        meal      eaten        in    the    gymnasium             at    the

rear    of    the    North     Stand.

I returned          to my previ o u s          position          on    the     track        at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

1.40 p.m.           I remember          that     by this         time     the       Spion       Kop    had    filled          up

considerably          and by 2.15 p.m.                the Spion           Kop       and South          Stand       appea r e d
                                                                                                   PAGE    2
                                                                                                   R287



to be near i n g           full      capacity,          these     parts      of    the ground b eing             taken          up

by Notts          Forest       fans.        At    this     same      time    I noticed           that    the North

Stand was          perhaps          only    half    full       and    this    also b eing          the    case       with       the

West       Stand       seats.

The    Leppings          Lane       terrace       has    three       pens    for standing           only       and    at

approximately              2.15      p.m.    I can recall             the    centre        pen    being    quite          full,

the pen nearest                the    police       control was             about     one    third       full    and       the

pen    towards          the N orth Stand            was     almost         empty.      This       was    c e rtainly

unusual       for a s e m i - f i n a l m atch being                  only    45 minutes           from kick off

time.        It was        obvious         that    the L i v e r p o o l     fans     had not       arri v e d       at    the

ground early             as    the    Spion       Kop and South             Stands     containing          the       Notts

Forest       fans were          almost       full.

By a p p r o x i m a t e l y    2.45       p.m.    the    North       Stand       a p p eared     to be    quite          full

but    the Liv e r p o o l          fans    in    the    seats d i r e c t l y       facing me were             very

intoxicated.              At normal          Sheffield          W e d n e s d a y matches         such    youths          would

have       been    arrested          at    the    turnstiles          for being         drunk      at a

sportsground.                 The    prob l e m was       that all          the young        white       males       aged

about       20-30       years       were    all    the     same      and    it would        have    been       impossible

to arrest          them all.              It was    quickly          evident       that     these       Liverpool          fans

were       very    hostile          and    abusive       towards       m y s e l f as a Police            Officer          and

Press       photographers             who were          taking up          p o sitions      on    the    track nearby.

At    about       this     time      (2.45 p.m.)           I can recall            hearing        on my personal

radio,       Superintendent                Marshall       at    the    Leppings        Lane       t u rnstiles

stating           there       was    a serious          p r o b l e m with     the    crowd       outside       and       that

he wanted          to have          the main       gate     opened.          I recall        Superintendent

Marshall          asking       for    the    gates       to be       opened       about     3 or 4 times             during

the following              few minutes            and    from his          voice,     he was       obviously          in some

distress.              I r e m e m b e r Police         Sergeant       626 G o d d a r d     in    the Police

C ontrol      saying           over       the radio,           'IF IT LOOKS AS T H O U G H                     S O M E O N E M IGHT

BE KILLED          THEN W E ’LL H AVE                 TO OPEN THE GATE'.

By 2 .5 5     p.m.        the       central        p en     fo r    standing          at    the     Leppings             L a ne    end

appeared          to     be    absolutely             packed        solid       whilst        the    p en      towards            the

Police       Control           was    about        half      full        and    the    pen     towards             the     North

Stand       was    perhaps           only       one    sixth        full.        For       normal        big       games      the

standing          fans        at    the    Leppings          Lane        terrace       have        filled          each     pen

slowly       well        before       kick       off.

At    this    t im e      (2.55       p . m . ) the         Liverpool           team       c ame    onto       the       pitch         to

'warm up'          and        this    brought          the     usual       'big       cheer'        from       the       Liverpool

fans.        I then           heard       Police       Constable           1868       Buxton        on    the        Police

radio       asking        for       the    kick       off    to     be    delayed.           I heard           Police

Sergeant          &1 6    Goddard          in    Police       Control           say,       'WE'VE        NO    CHANCE,            ONE

OF    THE    TEAMS        IS A L R E A D Y       OUT'.        The        Notts    Forest           team       an d    the

officials          ha d       NOT    at    this       point        come    out    onto       the     pitch.              About         two

minutes       later           the    Notts       Forest        team       and    officials           did       come        out     onto

the    pitch       to m o r e        cheers.

The    game       kicked           off at       3.00 p.m.           and after          a few minu t e s               L i v erpool

hit    the    crossbar,              again ma k i n g          the       crowd    shout with              excitement.

Normally          I would by              this     time      take        up my    seat       on     the       track        (when

Police       Sergeant              Chapman       retreated           into       the    players           tunnel),           but        as

I looked          towards           the L e p pings          Lane        terrace       (now a p p r o x i m a t e l y             3.05

p . m . ) I could             see    fans       being       allo w e d     onto       the    track        from        the     pens.

At    this    time        the       drunken        Liverpool             fans    in    the N o r t h Stand                 directly

in front          of me were              s h o uting       abuse        and    threatening              an o f f icial

Press       photographer              who       was d i r e c t i n g      his    camera           towards           the

Leppings          Lane        terrace.           I realised              that    these       fans        were        so hostile

that    I told           the       photographer             to go away           as I b e l i e v e d          he was         in

danger of being                    attacked.

There       were       now L i v e r p o o l       fans      runn i n g down           the     track          in     front        of
                                                                                                            PAGE       4

the North        Stand o b v i o u s l y          having       come       onto    the    track    from       the

Leppings       Lane      terrace.            I stopped           the      first    three youths             and       asked

them where         they were           going.           They    all       produced       North    Stand          seat

tickets       so I d i r e c t e d      them to go towards                      the Spion       Kop     then         turn

left    to get        into      the    seating          area.        By now all          I could       see       at    the

Leppings       Lane      end was        people          s p i lling       out    onto    the    track       and Police

Officers       trying         to prevent           them going             onto    the    pitch.        I then          saw

Superintendent            G r e e n w o o d run         onto     the pitch         towards       the referee,

obviously        requesting            him to stop             the     game.       The    players          all       then

went    off     the     field     and by          this    time       there       were    literally          hundreds

of fans       spilling          out    onto       the    track       through       the    gates       at    the

Leppings       Lane      terrace.            I recall          Inspector          Sewell       saying       on Police

radio    he     had     five     serials in         the     gym w h i c h were           then     sent      out       to

the    track     in front         of the N orth Stand                  and Leppings            Lane        terrace.              I

then saw the            St.     John's       Ambulance          drive        across      the    pitch       to       the

track    in     front      of    the L e p pings          Lane       terrace.

I was    at     this     time     in the same            position          on    the    track to prev e n t            the

drunken       Liv e r p o o l         fans    invading          the    pitch, but        a s s isted       by another

Serial who were               spread        out    in    front       of    the    N orth       Stand.

By 3.15 p.m.            a number        of casu a l t i e s          were       being    carried        across         the

pitch on stret c h e r s              and    shortly        afte r w a r d s      I noticed       c a sualties

being    carried         on a d v e r t i s i n g       hoardings          by    other    fans.         It was         now

apparent       that      a large        number          of fans        had been         crushed       in    the

central       pen.       It was        not    until       about        3.15      p.m.    that    the       scale       of

the disaster            became        apparent.           I was        by now very            frightened             for my

own    safety      as    the      crowd       in the North S t a n d were more                     hostile and I

feared    they would              invade          the    pitch en mass at any moment.                            I    began

to feel very sick                as    there        appeared           to be      total m a y h e m        everywhere.

Casualties         were       b eing    carried          across        the      pitch    in    their       dozens          and

many were        o b v iously         dead.        By about           3.40 p.m.         the Fire        Brigade            and
                                                                                                         PAGE      5

medical       services         were    present        and people             were    receiving           t r e atment

over    the    full      length       of the pitch.               I was       approached           by a male

Liverpool        fan aged        about       45 years        who was          gasping          for b r e a t h     but

able    to walk.          I assisted          him     towards          the    track       at the       corner          of

the    Spion     Kop,     but we were             unable     to get up             the    track      to the rear

of the N orth S tand             due    to    the     amount       of people             and    casu a l t i e s       being

carried on a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings.                      The    man    stated          he w o u l d   sit       down

for a while         on    the    track       at    the corner           of    the Spion           Kop.        I then

noticed       a number         of Police          Offic e r s     trying       to place           a male      casua l t y

onto    an    advertising         ho arding          on    the    pitch so I went                 to assist.                I

then helped         carry       this    c a s ualty up           the    track       to the        gymnasium            at

the rear        of the N orth Stand.                  There       was    a serial          of Po l i c e       forming

a cordon       to the      entry       at    the rear        of    the North             Stand.       There        was

only just        s ufficient room             to get        the    casualty          into       the gym where

other oficers            pulled       the man        in on       the    advertising             hoarding.              The

man was       s e m i-conscious,            white,        aged    about       25 years.

The    g y m n a s i u m was    full    of bodies           and    c asualties            still      alive       were

being     taken     to    the    far end.            I am unaware             who    the officers             were          who

took over my c a s ualty or who                       a s s i s t e d me      as    they were         from other

divis i o n s .

HAMMERTON            ROAD       POLICE       STATION




I commenced               duty       at    the    Sheffield           Wednesday            Football           Ground         at

9.^5     a.m.        on    Saturday,             1 5 th A p r i l     1 9 8 9 , and        a 10.00          a.m.       briefing             t oo k

place      in     the      North          Stand     by    Chief       Superintendent                  Duckenfield.                 I was

under      the       supervision             of     Police         Sergeant        Chapman,             serial         1,    covering

track      duties          throughout             the     operation.             Briefing             was     completed            at

approximately                 10.20        a.m.     and       I subsequently               took       up    a position             on       the

track      under          the    North       Stand        between         the    half       w ay      line       and    the       Spion

Kop      end.        I usually             work     the       same    duty      for     all      Sheffield             Wednesday

home      games        an d     I have       worked           many    semi-finals             at      the     ground         during          my

14      years     Police          Service.             I usually          take     up      the     s ame      position            as

stated         for     all      matches.

I noticed            tha t      a few        fans      had     entered       the      Spion        Kop      by    11.40          a.m.       and

there      wa s      a constant              trickle          of   fans     arriving          after         this       time       again        on

the      Spion       Kop      (Notts         Forest       fan s).

Meal      wa s    taken         at    approximately                1.15     p.m.      on    the       direction             of    Police

Sergeant          Chapman            and     this      was     a hot      meal     eaten         in     the      gymnasium             at    the

rear      of     the      North       S tan d .

I returned             to my         previous          position        on    the      track        at      approximately

1.40      p.m.         I remember             t ha t     by    this    time      the       Spion        Kop      had    filled          up

considerably               an d      by 2 . 1 5     p.m.       the    Spion      Kop       and     South         Stand       appeared
                                                                                                            PAGE 2
                                                                                                            R287


to be     nearing            full       capacity,            these       parts       of    the     ground           being       taken       up

by N o t t s       Forest         fans.         At     this    same       time       I noticed           t h at      the    North

Stand     was       perhaps            only     half     full       and    this       also       being      the          case    with       the   *

West     Stand        sea ts.

The     Leppings            Lane       terrace         has    three       pens       for    standing            only       and    at

approximately                2.15       p.m.     I can        recall       the       centre        pen     being          quite       full,

the     pen    nearest            the    police         control          was    about       on e    third           full    and       the

pen     towards          the      North        Stand     was       almost       empty.           This      was       certainly

unusual        for       a semi-final                match     being       only       45    minutes         from          kick    off

time.         It    was      obvious           t hat    the    Liverpool             fans    had     not        arrived          at    the

ground        early         as    the    Spion         Kop    and    South       Stands          containing               the    Notts

Forest        fans       were      almost        full.

By a p p r o x i m a t e l y       2.45        p.m.     the    North       Stand          appeared         to be          quite       full

but     the    Liverpool               f ans    in     the    seats       directly          facing         me       were    very

intoxicated.                 At    normal        Sheffield           Wednesday             matches         such          youths       would

h ave    been       arrested            at     the     turnstiles          for       being       drunk      at       a

sportsground.                    The    problem         was    that       all    the       young     white           males       aged

about     20-30          years         were     all     the    s a me     and    it       would     ha ve       been       impossible

to a r r e s t      them         all.         It was     quickly          evident          that     these           Liverpool          f an s

were     very       hostile            an d    abusive        towards          myself       as     a Police              Officer       and

Press     photographers                  who     w ere       taking       up    positions           on     the       track       nearby.

At    about        t hi s    time       ( 2.45       p.m.)     I    can    recall          hearing         on       my    personal

radio,        Superintendent                   Marshall        at    the       Leppings          L ane     turnstiles

stating            there         was    a serious            problem       with       the    crowd         outside          and       th at

he w a n t e d      to      have       the     main     gate       opened.           I recall        Superintendent

Marshall           asking         for     the    gates        to    be    opened          about     3 or        4    times       during

the     following            few       minutes         and    from       his    voice,       he     wa s    obviously             in    some

distress.             I remember               Police        Sergeant          626    Goddard        in     the          Police

By 2 . 5 5      p.m.         the      central         pen        fo r    standing             at    th e    Leppings             L ane     end

appeared            to     be     absolutely              packed         solid         whilst        the     pen       towards           the

Police         Control            was      about      half        f u ll      and      the     pen     towards            the     North

Stand       was      perhaps             only       one    sixth         full.           For       normal       b ig      games      the

standing            f a ns      at    the      Leppings           Lane        terrace          have        filled         each      pen

slowly         well        before          kick      off.                                                                                           !

At    t hi s    time         ( 2 .55       p . m . ) the         Liverpool             team        came     onto       the       pitch        to    j

'warm       up'      and        t h is     brought         the        usual        'big       cheer'        from       the       Liverpool          j

fans.          I then           heard         Police       Constable               1868       Buxton       on     the       Police

radio       asking           fo r     the      kick       of f    to     be    delayed.              I heard           Police

Sergeant            6l 6     Goddard           in    Police        Control             say,        'WE'VE       NO     CHANCE,           ONE

OF    THE      TEAMS         IS      ALREADY         OUT'.          The       Notts       Forest           team      and     the

officials            had        NOT      at    this       point         come       out    onto       the     pitch.              About        two

minutes         later           the      Notts       Forest           team     a nd      officials           did       come       o ut     onto

the    pitch         to      more        cheers.

The    g ame        kicked           off      at    3-00     p.m.        and       after       a    few m i n u t e s        Liverpool

hit    the      crossbar,                again       making           the     crowd       shout        with       excitement.

Normally            I would           by      this    time        take        up    my    seat       on     the      track        (when

Police         Sergeant              Chapman         retreated               into      the     players          tunnel),            bu t      as

I looked            towards           the      Leppings           Lane        terrace          (now        approximately                 3.05

p . m . ) I could               see      fans       being        allowed           onto       the    track        from       the     pens.

At    this      t i me       the      drunken         Liverpool               f an s     in    the     North         Stand        directly

in    front         of     me     were        shouting           abuse        and      threatening              an     official

Press       photographer                   who      was    directing               his    camera           towards          the

Leppings            L a ne      terrace.             I realised               that       these       fans       were        so    hostile

that     I told            the       photographer                to     go    away       as    I believed              he    wa s     in

danger         of     being          attacked.

There       were         now      Liverpool           fans         running          down       the     track         in     front        of

the     North       Stand       obviously                  having       comeonto            the    track        from        the

Leppings        Lane       terrace.               I        stopped          the f i r s t    three         youths         and       asked

them     where       they       were        going.              They    a ll       produced           North      Stand          seat

tickets        so    I directed              them          to    go    towards            the     Spion        Kop    then          turn

left     to    get       into    the        seating             area.         By n o w       all      I could         se e      at    the

Leppings        Lane       end       wa s    people             spilling           ou t     onto      the      track       and       Police

Officers        trying          to    prevent              them       going        onto      the      pitch.          I then          saw

Superintendent              Greenwood                 run       onto    the        pitch        towards         the       referee,

obviously           requesting              him       to    stop       the      g a m e.        The    players            all       then

went     off    the       field       and       by     this          time     there         were      literally            hundreds

of    fans     spilling          ou t       onto       the       track        through           the    gates         at    the

Leppings        Lane       terrace.               I recall             Inspector             Sewell         saying         on       Police

radio     he    had       five       serials               in   the     gym        which     were       then         sent       out       to

the     track       in    front       of     the           North       Stand         and     Leppings           Lane       terrace.                I

th en    saw    the       St.    John's           Ambulance             drive         across          the      pitch       to       the

track     in    front       of       the     Leppings                Lane     terrace.

I wa s    at    this       time       in     the       same          position         on     the      track      to       prevent          the

drunken        Liverpool               fa ns      invading              the     p i t c h , but       assisted            by a n o t h e r

Serial        who    were       spread          o ut       in    front        of     the     North          Stand.

By    3.15     p.m.       a number           of       casualties              were        being       carried         across          the

pitch     on    stretchers                and     shortly             afterwards             I noticed           casualties

being     carried          on    advertising                    hoardings            by     other      fans.          It     was      now

apparent        t h at     a large           number             of    fans      had       been     crushed           in    the

central        pen.        It    was        not       until          about      3.15        p.m.      t h at    the       scale       of

the     disaster          became          apparent.                  I was      by now          very       frightened               for    my

own     safety       as    the        crowd           in    the       North        Stand were           more     hostile and                   I

feared        they       would        invade           the       pitch        en     m a s s at    any      moment.             I    began

to    feel     very       sick       as     there           appeared            to    be     total         mayhem         everywhere.

Casualties           were       being        carried             across         the       pitch       in    their         dozens          an d

many     were       obviously             dead.            By    about        3-40        p.m.     the      Fire      Brigade             and

medical        services             were       present          and       people          were       receiving                treatment

over     the     full         length          of    the       pitch.           I was       approached                by       a male

Liverpool           fan       aged       about          45    years       who    was       gasping             for       breath       bu t

able     to    walk .          I assisted                him    towards          the       track          at    the       corner       of

the     Spion       Kop,       but       we    were          unable       to    get       up    the       track          to    the    rear

of    the     North       Stand          due       to    the    amount          of    people             and    casualties             being

carried        on     advertising                  hoardings.              The       man       stated          he    would       sit     down

for     a while          on    the       track          at    the    corner          of    the       Spion          Kop.        I t hen

noticed        a number             of    Police             Officers          trying          to    place          a male       casualty

onto     an    advertising                hoarding             on    the       pitch       so       I went          to    assist.            I

then     helped          carry       t hi s        casualty          up    the       track          to    the       gymnasium          at

the     rear     of      the    North          Sta nd.          There          was    a serial             of       Police       forming

a cordon         to      the    entry          at       the    rear       of    the       North          Stand.           There       was

only     just       sufficient                room       to    get    the       casualty             i n to     the       gym    where

other       oficers           pulled          the       man    in    on    the       advertising                hoarding.              The

man     was    semi-conscious,                      white,          aged       about       25 year s .

The     gymnasium             was    full          of    bodies       and       casualties                still          alive       were

being       taken        to    the       far       end.        I am u n a w a r e          who       the       officers          were        who

t ook    over       my    casualty             or who           assisted             me    as       they       were       from       other
