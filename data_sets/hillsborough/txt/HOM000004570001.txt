   TAYLOR REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW OFFENCES AND PENALTIES:

   (i)     TICKET TOUTING OFFENCE           [70]
   (ii)    OFFENCES IN THE GROUND           [71]
   (iii)   USE OF ATTENDANCE CENTRES        [72]
   (iv)    USE OF ELECTRONIC TAGGING        [73]



   The Home Secretary has seen your submission of 11 July.

   2    He considers that there is a case for a ticket touting
   offence limited to football, where there is a particular
   problem of people travelling without tickets and then causing'
   trouble. He is also in favour of the three proposed offences
   in the ground, which he considers would have a greater
   deterrent effect than the one offence of disorderly conduct.
