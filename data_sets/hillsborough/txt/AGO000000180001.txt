Further to my letter of 24 July I have now had an opportunity
together with Derek Spencer to examine in detail the application
made under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for authority to
apply to the High Court for an order directing a fresh inquest
in relation to the six persons who died in the Hillsborough
tragedy.

You were concerned especially on behalf of Mrs Anne Williams,
whose son Kevin was one of those who died.    I am sorry that my
decision has taken longer than I would have wished but, in view
of the strength of feelings amongst the families of the deceased
and its intrinsic importance, I was determined that it should be
considered thoroughly.

Section 13 of the Act applies when an inquest has been held and
"by reason of fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of
proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the discovery of new facts
or otherwise, it is necessary or desirable in the interests of
justice that another inquest should be held."

I have considered the matter very carefully but I have come to
the conclusion that there is nothing which would justify my
authorising an application to the High Court for a new inquest
in any of the cases.   I have reached my decision on the grounds
that the application would have no reasonable prospect of
establishing that it is necessary or desirable in the interests
of justice for a fresh inquest to be held.

In examining the application I had full regard to the various
considerations which were urged upon me during the meeting with
Merseyside Members held on 15 June.    Colleagues emphasised the
importance to the families of the deceased of having the fullest
possible information about the precise circumstances of the
deaths and I have taken that carefully into account when
considering the sufficiency of the inquiry made by the Coroner
and his directions to the jury.    All those issues must however
be considered in the context of the statutory framework within
which Coroners are required to work and the questions required
to be answered on the inquisition.       It is not appropriate,
therefore, that I should authorise an application to the High
Court under section 13 unless it could be said, with reasonable
confidence, that further information would be likely to be
elicited which would have a bearing on the issues to be
considered at any such further inquest.
              *
I recognise that this decision will be disappointing to the
applicants, for whom I have the deepest sympathy, but they can
be assured that I have looked at this matter with great care.
