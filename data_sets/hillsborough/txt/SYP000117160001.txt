      On Saturday,               15 A p r i l         1989       I commenced            d u t y at 9 . 0 0 a m           at    the N i a g a r a

      stables.             I intended             meeting             officers        who      were          attending         on a m u t u a l

      aid      basis       from      other        forces.              On    arrival         at N i a g a r a        1 saw         that

      Superintendent                 Marsh        was       already          in a t t e n d a n c e          there      and    since        I h ad

      a   radio       and       went    to       the       North Stand            where        the       briefing         commenced              at

      10.00am,             Following             the       briefing          refreshments                were     available              and

      serials         were       instructed, to                  be    in    position          by       "11.0 0 a m .     Having           had

      something            to    eat    and       a dri n k ,          I went        out     into        the    street         on the

      Pe n i s t o n e     Road      side        of    the       ground        just     before           11. OOaifi.          My    i nitial

      patrol         was    around          the       triangle          area      where        1 noticed             that      all       officers

      and      barriers          were       in    position,                 X had     a short            conversation with                      each

      pair      of    constables             as       1 walked          round        this      area and was               satisfied              that-

      it was         properly          contained.                 I continued              and walk ed            out     into       the

      Catchbar            Lane    and       then M i dd le w o o d             Road     area        where       I saw         that       officers

      were      deployed          on    their          patrols          and      it w a s      at       this    time      that       1 noticed

      that      the       Park    Hotel          on W a d s ley L a n e           was      obviously            closed and               the

      windows         boarded          up.        1 t ook         particular            notice           of    t his     because           at    the

      Setrii-F i rial        19a 8     I had          to    close       these        premises            at 2 . 1 5 p m       following

      trouble         with       persons          drinking             therein.            I then wa lk ed               back       along        the

      length         of    Leppings          Lane          to    the    traffic         roundabout              end,      again          seeing

      that      officers          were       deployed             on    their        patrols            as    required and               I spe n t

      s o me    time       at    that       end       considering              the    segregation               of      supporters              after

      the      match.           This    proved             to    be    somewhat         problematic               last        year       when

      lar g e    numbers          of    people             left       the    ground        because            opposing         fans'

      coaches         are       often       parked          in the          Herries        Road         area    and      this       is     one    of

the    closest         points           that       the        two    opposing           sides      come        together.              L ast

year,       I had      had        to    deploy a              l a rge     cordon across                the     r oad      here     to

ensure       that      segregation,                  and       I spent          some      time     wondering              how     this

could       be a c h i e v e d         th is    year.

During       my      initial           walk     round there                were        supporters            already         about         but

there       were      not       that     many.            I am       not     aware        what     t ime       the     turnstiles               at

Lappings          Lane       actually           opened.              I recall           from      the     briefing           t ha t     some

gates       were      to     be      o p e n e d at       11.00am          but     that        the m a j o r i t y        were     to      be

opened a t           1E n o o n .

As    the m o r n i n g         progressed               1 p atr o l led on             foot      in the        area       I have

previously            described              but     I did          not    go     right        down     to     the     Hillsborough

shopping          precinct,             having           had a s h o r t          conversation               with      Inspector

Humphries            who     stated          t hat       things         w e r © r e 1a t i v e l y      quiet        at    that       end.

Road     area        gradually            i n c r e a s e d as          time      went      by    particularly               with       the

comment:: a merit          of     the    arrival              of    coaches        which         were     initially             parked            in

As    the    pedestrian                traffic           increased,             and     particularly with                    the

weather        being         good       at     the       t i m e , groups          of     people        were        making        t h ei r

way    to    the      ground           while       others           were     sitting           on w a l l s     or     standing            :i.n

groups       on      spare        land and           a    significant              number         of    these        were       drinking

alcohol        from        tins        and     large          plastic        bottles.,            I myself           advised

numerous          people          that       t hey       would       not     be    allowed         to     t ak e     alcohol          into

the    ground         nor       would        they        be a d m i t t e d       if    they were            drunk        and     I heard

the    crowds         as     they       built        up,,          With    regard         to     the    behaviour            of    the

Liverpool            f ans      as     they a p pr oa ch ed               the     ground,         I would describe                    it as

boisterous            but       there        were        no    outbreaks           that        1 saw      of    public          o r de r

problems          although             1 do     recall             hearing        transmissions                on    the     radio

At     about       1.30pm          I walked             along       Leppings         Lane       which       wa s     very      busy       on

both      sides         of    the       r o ad     with       pedestrian           traffic           a n d as      I passed           the

Lappings           Lane       end       1 saw       that       it w a s      very       busy.         1 remember              stopping

there      a few moments                     and    seeing          mounted        officers           encouraging              people             to

enter       the     ground          or       to    c le a r    away       from     the      rear      pen     if     they were            not

ticket        holders.              I then walked                   out    into      Mi d d 1e w o o d R o a d        where          it w a s

again       fairly           busy,       Liverpool             supporters            being         encouraged            to    park

their       cars        in    that       a r e a,       particularly              in s i d e       roads.

I recalled              t h at     the       one    special          train        e x p e c t e d w as      due      to a r r i v e       at

around        2.COpm          and       with       t ha t     in m i n d     I returned              along      Leppings             L a ne

intending           to       go    to    the       traffic          island        end     and      observe         the     movement               of

spectators              with       regard          to    segregation.                As     I walked         f r o m C a t chtoar

Lane      I saw         that       the       area around             the     bridge         over      the     river        was       very

busy      indeed with               people          and       that     the       Leppings          Lane     enclosure            was

similarly                t r erne J.y b u s y           although          apparently            under       control.             I

continued           along          Leppings             Lane which           was     also       extremely            busy      toward

t he    traffic          island          end.           As    I approached              the     traffic         island         I saw          the

front       en d    of       the    escorted             fans       who    I assumed were                 the      occupants            of

t he    special          train.              They were           being       escorted           by m o u n t e d      officers.-

foot      officers,-              and    I s a w at           le ast      on e    dog     van.        The    majority            of     these

people        appeared             confined             to    the    f o o t p a t h arid t h er e          wa s     a. considerab.1 e

number        of    them.           I a r r i v e d at          the       traffic         island       end      of    Leppings           L a ne

and     saw    that          there       we re      no       difficulties            regarding            segregation             and         I

remained           at    t h at     traffic             island       for     some       time.

It     is d i f f i c u l t        to    be       precise       but       1 think         it w o u l d      be a p p r o a c h i n g

2 . 3 0 pm w h e n       I heard             a message          on m y       r a d io     which       was    officers            at     the

Leppings           Lane       ent r a n c e        to    the    g r o u n d a s k i ng        f or    v e h i cui-nr t r a f f i c to

be     stopped          along       Leppings             L an e .      I re c a l l       t hi s     particularly             because              I.

was     s t a n d i Tig n e xt          to    the       PC    working        traffic          duty     on    the      i s l a n d who
had    an a l t e r c a t i o n         with        a    driver       who       had     driven         at    speed        through

persons          crossing            the      road       while      sounding            his      horn       but    making        no

attempt          to    slow       down.          The      officer          advised          this       driver          quite     properly

but    in no          uncertain             terms        a n d as     he    set       off     he was         in f a c t      the      first

vehicle          to    be     denied          access       to L e p p i n g s         Lane.        Still          being      busy with

pedestrian             traffic          but w i t h        apparently              no    threat         of    segregation

problems,             L left the t r a f f i c               island         end       of L e p p i n g s      Lane        and    started

to w a l k       b ack      towards           the L e p p i n g s      Lane        entrance            to    the       ground.         As    I

was    walking           along         it w a s         fairly      evident           to me       that       the       persons

approaching                 the     ground were            those       who       had     either         beers to          licensed               j

premises          or        had     stayed away            from       the    ground           in o t h e r        places        drinking         ,
                                                                                                                                                 I

stood       at    the       back       of     the       crowd     in the         area       of    the       sweet       shop     in

not    in the          middle          of     the       road.       I could           see m o u n t e d       officers           among

large       there        was      no    indication              to me       that        there      was       any       serious

problem          by    the      turnstiles               themselves.               f r o m my      position             I c o u l d see

the      teams        had    c o me     out.         As    I recall             it was         not        the      start       of    the      game

left      and        an    Inspector          using        the       pubic         address             system         asking        the      cro w d

to    top      pushing           forward         and      he    repeated            this       message             several          times .            A

rnome n t or          so a f t e r      t h is     I r eca 11            seeing         Gate       A    being         tugged        open

although             I could       not       see     due       to    the      crowd          in f r o n t        of     me    who    wa s

opening          it «       I r ernerftbe r t h i n k i n g              to m y s e l f       that        if     th at       gate    wa s

opened         it w o u l d       never       be m a n a g e d           to   be    closed again.                       However,          after

s o me    fe w       seconds       the       gate      in f act           was      pulled          to.         During         that       time      a

significant                number       of    people           passed         throug h Gate                 A.        I am. not          in a

position             to    estimate          how many           but       I can         say     that        after        that       gate      had

been      c 1o s e d       the    numfaers         i n the L e p p i n g s              Lane       ent rance            pen had          reduced

significantly.                    Whether          other        gates         were       opened           at     about        the    same

time      I am        unable       to      say.        After         the      closing           of G a t e         A,    people

continued             to    enter       via      the      turnstiles               and       the       numbers          in that

entrance             pen    further          reduced.               In the         few m o m e n t s           that      followed

things         seemed        to    have       quietened              down       considerably and                        I then       heard a

time    what         had      happened within                 the       ground         and       I assumed           it w a s      some

sort     of    public           order         problem.           I then          heard       a message           on m y          ra dio      to

the    effect           that       no    further          persons          were       to    be a l l o w e d     into        the       ground

Leppings           Lane       entance          pen of       people          and       not    to a l l o w a n y         further

of L e p p i n g s       Lane       fairly        sterile.              There         were       still       quite      a    large

number        of     people         out       in L e p p i ngs L a n e           itself.              While    hoi d i n g        the     rear

Superintendent                  Marshall          returned            to    my    position             and    having         had a

short      conversation                  with     h i m we       estimated             that       we    had    some         40    or    so

officers           with       us    and       available.              Superintendent                   Marshall         attempted               to

use    his     radio          to a s k        control       where          these       officers          could        be     best

deployed           but     he      received          no    reply.           In v i e w       of       this    inability            to

communicate              he     i n s t r u c t e d me      to     go      personally             to    the    control            box and

advise        regarding             the       situation          in L e p p i n g s         Lane.        I entered               the

ground        by G a t e        C and         headed       for     the      police          control          box.       I s aw

nurne rous         p e o p 1e together               with     police          of f i cers         in that        apen area

behind        the       West       Stand       and    s ome      of     the      people          appeared        to     be       injured.

I continued              towards          the     control          room a nd           climbed          the    stairs-             On

looking        o ver       the      playing          area     my      initial          impression             wa s    that        the r e
had    been          s om e     sort       of    p i t,c h i n v a s i o n       but     I then        saw      that       there           were

what       appeared             to    be    numerous           casualties,                 I entered            the      control            box

and    spoke          to,       I think,          Superintendent                   Murray.            I explained              that         we

had    s ome         officers          available              for     deployment            in L e p p i n g s         Lane        and      he

said words                to    the    effect          that     we w e r e         to    hold       the     back       end.          1

returned             to L e p p i n g s         Lane     and    conveyed            the     message            to Mr.         Marshall.

Realising             t hat      something             fairly major                had     occurred            and     hearing

snatches             of    transmission                referring            to a m b u l a n c e s        and     casualties                I

decided          to       c l ear     as    far     as      possible          the       rear     of    the      Leppings             Lane

instructed                the    PCs       with     rue to      keep        the     rear       of     the      service            road and

the    entrance                p e n as     clear        as    at a ll        possible           and      1 asked Sergeant

Thomas          of     the      Mounted          Branch        to     try a n d         clear,        again       as     far       as

possible-              people         away       from       that      b ack      end.       1 walked            out      .into L e p p i n g

traffic          mobile.              I asked          officers            in t h a t      mobile         to    close         Leppings

spoke       to a t r a f i c           motorcyclist                  and    then        to a t r a f f i c        supervisor

was      approached               by    two       doctors             in L e p p i n g s       Lane       who    said     that       they       had

answered             the    public           appeal          and       1 was        able       to    use    my    radio        to ask

where         these        should           be    directed.                 X was        told       the    gymnasium.               Things

had      begun        to    quieten              down       outside           by    this       time       and    I personally              took

these         two     doctors           underneath                the       North Stand              through        to    the

gymnasium.                 I entered              the       gymnasium              and    directed          the     doctors          to    the

injured            persons         area.           I there             saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Marsh     and       it was          at

t h is     stage          t hat    the       scale          of    the       disaster           was    made       known        to me.           in

view       of      the     situation              I suggested                 to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      Harsh        t hat      faced

with an            incident            of    these          proportions              t hat      he a n d        I could        perhaps

serve         the     joint        effort          better             by m a n n i n g     our       p o sts     at H e a d q u a r t e r s »
