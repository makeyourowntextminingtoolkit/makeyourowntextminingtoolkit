Dear sirs

re;  CASE NUMBER C O /1009/92 - REGINA -V- HER MAJESTY'S CORONER FOR SOUTH
YORKSHIRE - EX-PARTE STRINGER AND OTHERS

Due to the various commitments of Dr Popper, the Coroner for South
Yorkshire, at the time of the Inguest which is the subject of this
action, the Plaintiff has agreed to an extension of time for the filing
of affidavits to 30 July 199 3. I enclose a copy of letters dated 17 May
and 2 June 1993 confirming this position.

I trust that the Court will have no objection to this agreed extension of
time.

Please let me know if you require anything further.

Yours faithfully

Contacted Mr. Coghlan and spoke to his clerk. Asked him to put a marker with
Mr. Coghlan for instructions on this case. He has just been made a Q.c. but
the clerk indicated that in the circumstances given the nature of the case he
will probably be very pleased to deal with it and recognition would be taken
as a fact that he had only just been made up to a Q.c.

I am writing to request your agreement to an extension of time for the
filing of the affidavit on behalf of HM Coroner.

Dr Popper, who as you will appreciate, is crucial to the preparation of
the affidavit has a number of commitments including a three week holiday
to 1 June 1993.

In the circumstances I would be grateful if you could write to confirm
your agreement to an extension of time for filing affidavits to 30 July

I trust that you will be able to accede to this request and look forward
to hearing from you accordingly.

Meeting with Andrew Callaghan, Dibb Lupton Broomhead

Andrew Callaghan is representing the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service.

At.present he does not see the point of becoming involved.  I have agreed that
subject to obtaining instructions from my client then we will circulate the
draft Affidavits in advance of filing them with the Court to ensure that any
further relevant information that can be included is so included.

His information from Gregg and Co. was very similar to mine but he also learnt
that the legal aid certificate is limited to Counsel's Opinion on the
Respondents Affidavit.

                                            you would contact my office to arrange a mutually convenient time

                  Dear Mr Sturt,

                  Hillsborough Inquest

                  Thank you for your letter of 30th April and.in particular for the most
                  helpful enclosures.

                  In our subsequent telephone conversation I indicated to you that I did not
                  feel it proper to take a substiative part in dealing with the Hillsborough
                  Judicial Review and that my Deputy Judith Naylor will represent the interests
                  of this Office in all the preparation woifk. Mrs Elizabeth Bashforth from the
                  Legal and Admin Department for the Sheffield City Council is acting as
                  "our" solicitor and I will send her a copy of your letter and its enclosure.

                  I know that the Legal and Admin Department are very much inclined to use
                  experienced Counsel but I will stress to them nonetheless that senior
                  Coroners such as yourself   and Dr Burton view   this  case as having important
                  implications in years to   come.  I would also suggest to Mrs Bashforth that
                  she liaises directly with Dr Burton about the possibility of an Amicus
                  Curiae.

                  Many thanks once again for the helpful document, quite apart from anything
                  else this will certainly be useful in the day to day cases w h e n lack of care
                  crops up for consideration.   If you have a transcript of the judgement in
                  the Buckley case I would   be grateful ifyou could consider letting me have a
                  copy.  Obviously I would   be prepared tomeet your charges.

                  Best Wishes          ___

NOTE FOR FILE




Note of a Telephone Conversation with Linda Cunningham
Tel:

Linda Cunningham has been asked to represent the Coroner in her area in a
judicial review against a decision to allow a jury to consider a verdict of
unlawful killing.  In this case an individual has died in a police cell and
the jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing. The police have made an
application for judicial review of the Coroner's decision to allow the jury to
consider the verdict of unlawful killing.

She is concerned as to whether or not the local authority can act for the
Coroner. I explained our thinking that the local authority paid for the
Coroner's Office and although he was an independent appointment we were able
to act for the Department which funded his office. Apparently no one has
suggested that they cannot act but it is a concern.  I informed her that we
had written to the Court on the Coroner's behalf and informed the Solicitors
involved and nobody had suggested that we could not properly act. The only
issue that we were considering was whether there was a potential conflict of
interest given our involvement as licensing authority.

VJe agreed that should any further information arise at either end then we
would contact the other.

         Dear Mark

         Hillsborough Inquest - Judicial Review

           Further to our conversation on Monday afternoon I am writing to enclose
          copies of the various notes and transcripts in my possession concerning the
          present law on "Lack of Care".  I hope these will be of use.  It would be of
          great interest to receive copies from you of the most recent cases.

          I am also enclosing a copy of the letter sent to the Home Office (and
          subsequently copied to me) by Mr J Glover who was one of the applicants.
          I have sent a copy of the letter to Dr Popper and suggested that he respond
          direct to the Home Office but I have also made it quite plain to both Stefan
          and the Home Office that a full reply may be inappropriate now in view of the
          pending case.

          We agreed at the meeting that I would now step back from any dealings with
          the Judicial Review, I am asking my Deputy Judith Naylor to undertake that
          responsibility on behalf of the Office of HM Coroner.  J u d i t h ’s home address

          We discussed the difficulties of the City Council Legal Department dealing
          with this case on behalf of the Coroner.  We agreed that on the information
          presently available there was no reason to believe that there was any
          conflict on interest and that yourself and Liz Bashforth would continue to
           deal with the matter.

           If any problems arise please do not hesitate to contact me.

           yours -sincerely________                                                    •i

  ar Sir,
            I am the father of Ian Thomas Glover (deceased) who died at the
Hillsborough S*adium disaster on 15th April 1989* I have tried to get answers
to how and why he died that day (nearly    k (four) years ago) without success.
Now I'm putting some of those questions to you.
We were told by Mrs Thatcher (prime minister at the time) that there would be
no cover up and the truth would be told .Up to now the truth has not been told
 nd as a British, citizen I think I am entitled to know how and why my son died.
If the South Yorkshire Police did wrong on that day they should be accountable
to the public in the same way as a member of the. public would be accountable to
them if they done wrong.
If you find the questions difficult to answer then ask Lord Justice Tayliir who
carried out the inquiry into the disaster he may be able to help you.If you don't
answer my questions then I shall write to the queen to see if she cam help.


1) Why hase I not received a death certificate for my son?                      r
2) Video tapes of the disaster unfolding were viewed by the South Yorkshire
Police .When Dr^Popper (coroner) askee to show them at the inquest to the jury
 jPK
he was informed that they had gone missing. Where are those tapes?
3) Myself and other     families attended a public court in Manchester to decide
liability and blame     for the disaster.lt was attended   by barristers representing
South Yorkshire Police,Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Sheffield City Council and the
stadium designers. As we sat in the court the Police admitted liability in neg­
ligence and the judge said isn't anybody in this court blaming the supporters
for the disaster.Nobody answered.Just after that we were asked to leave the court
and the case was carried on behind colsed doors .All the families present       were well
behaved and no one was allowed in the court.I would like to know why we were not
allowed to find out     who     is taking the blame.
*0 My son was taken     out of the pen approximately 20 minutes past 3 by two Police
Officers and layed on his back.At approximately 4p.m. he still had a pulse .Why was
he not taken to hospital in the    bo minutes in between?when there was a line of
ambulances waiting to take people to hospital?
5) Dr Popper said he was conducting the inquests as if it was a road accident
with one death.The fact is it was inside a stadium and 95 people died consequently
it became the largest inquest in British history why was he allowed to get away
with this?                                                       continued
  >ny was Dr Popper allwoed to stop questions which arose after 3«15p»m«   when seme,
 people who died were clearly still alive after that point?
' 6) Why was the South Yorkshire Police praised for a full day during the inquests
 and allowed to read out statements praising one and others actions during the
 miners strike when clearly this had no bearing whatso ever on the Hillsborough
 Disaster?
 7)Because my son was over 18 and unemployed the only compensation we recieved was
 his funeral expenses?
 8) My wife ancTI travelled to Sheffield Town Hall every day of the inquests (four
 months) at a cost of    over £17,000 (seventeen thousand pounds).££ South Yorkshire
 Police were negligent that day why do they not pay me all the expenses we have
 incurred?


 I beg you to bring put the truth    of the Hillsborough disaster in order to allow     “
 the souls of the ninety five people who died to rest in peace as I am sure this is •
 not possible while the cover up goes on.




 Yours sincerely,




 Mr J. Glover.
NOTE FOR FILE


Note of a Meeting with Chris Dorrfes, Mark Webster and Liz Bashforth

1.   Discussed the conduct of the case generally, in particular the potential
      conflict of interest and agreed that we would act at present.

2.   Andrew Callaghan, Dibb Lupton represented the ambulance service, we
      should also contact West Midlands Police and the Fire Brigade.

3.   in relation to lack of care there are two cases - Poplar and a West
      Yorkshire case.  I undertook to pass to Chris Dorr'es a copy of the
      Poplar case in the first instance and on appeal.

4.   We need to check the Coroner's rules as to what happens if the verdict
      is quashed. The application makes reference to a case which allows the
      verdict to be quashed and an open verdict instead.

5.   Judith ? is to take over the day to day running of the case given Chris
      Dorres involvement although he will be keeping an eye on it.

6.    They do have a complete set of the papers.

1.    E=fea«e to send a copy of the letter from one of the applicants to the
       Home Office which it seems advisable not to respond to.

8.   Which Counsel to use was discussed and it was agreed that we should look
      at using the same Counsel who had dealt with the Poplar case on appeal
      given that he had opposed Fitzgerald (who is acting for the Applicant on
      this case as well) as he should be familiar with the arguments on lack
      of care.

NOTE OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH CROWN COURT LISTING AND SOUTH YORKSHIRE
POLICE RE HILLSBOROUGH JUDICIAL REVIEW


Liz Bashforth rang Crown Court Listing to confirm that it had been listed for
20 minutes at 10.30am and if we rang up after 2.00pm on the day before we will
find out the actual time and which Judge is hearing the case.

Also rang South Yorkshire Police and spoke to                  | tel number
50 0700 ext 3068. He confirmed that South Yorkshire Police would not attend
the hearing on advice from the Joint Secretariat and Hammond Suddards. He
also said that if the hearing went ahead then it would have an affect on the
Tony Bland inquest and apparently pressure is being brought to bear on the
Bland family to use their son's inquest to re-open the issues.

Draft copy of the letter was sent to the Coroner for his instructions and he
had no comments to make on the letter.

NOTE OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION ON 4.3.93 BETWEEN EB AND CHRISTOPHER DORRIES,
HM CORONER

Christopher Dorries rang about the letter informing him of the date of the
hearing in the High Court on the 6.4.93. He said he was on holiday for two
weeks but that he did not intend to attend the Court Hearing. I responded that
at this stage it was simply an application for leave to apply for judicial
review and therefore would usually be ex parte. He had not realised that and
was therefore more comfortable at not attending. He told me that he had
informed the Police and Ambulance service about the new date. I confirmed
that I would inform the Director of Health and Consumer services, the Leader
of the council and the Chief Executive.  I informed those people later on the
same day.

    Dear Mr Webster

    INQUEST INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - JUDICIAL REVIEW

    Further to your letter of 5 October 1992, I understand from Messrs
    Malcolm J Gregg & Co that their Application for Leave to Apply for
    Judicial Review has been re-listed for 6 April 1993.  I am presently
    instructed by the Chief Constable that it is not necessary for the West
    Midlands Police to be separately represented at this Application, but I
    would be grateful if you could advise me of any steps you intend taking
    on behalf of the Coroner.

    Yours sincerely

    We thank you for your letter of 7th September 1992.

Further to our recent discussions regarding the potential legal action in
relation to the Hillsborough Inquest I enclose herewith copies of two
letters, for your information.

The first is a response from Municipal Mutual regarding the insurance
position and you will note that, in the Insurer's view, any costs
incurred as a result of the applications in relation to the Hillsborough
Inquest cannot be met by insurance.

The second is a copy of my letter to the Solicitors acting for the
various families requesting an update on the current position.

I will contact you again as and when I receive a response.

SI 2HH




Dear Mrs Bashforth,

Hillsborough Inquest

I refer to your letter of the 24th August, 1992 and the enclosed copy
documentation relating to the applications for Judicial Review etc,
following the Hillsborough Inquest.

I can confirm that any additional costs incurred iri carrying out a
Judicial Review would not be covered by any of the Council1s Liability
Policies with us in force at the time of the Hillsborough Disaster.
The reasons for this are as follows

1.     The relationship of the Council to its appointed Coroners is not
       the normal relationship of Employer and Employee. It is most
       easily considered as a "statutory office" to which the Council
       appoints and meets the salary and other expenses. Except in this
       narrow sense, the Council is not responsible for the conduct of
       the Coroner, who occupies an independent Judicial cffu^L

       Our Liability Policies operate in respect of claims against the
       Council and its Employees only.

2.     The Coroner enjoys the same qualified privilege as Judges and
       Magistrates and, therefore, cannot be sued in negligence.

       Our Liability Policies operate only in respect of claims brought
       in negligence.




                                                                                       Continued

3.    Judicial Reviews are not actions for compensation.

      Our Liability Policies provide Defence Costs cover provided there
      is at the same time a claim under the Policy for compensation
      following negligence.


For the above reasons, therefore, I am afraid we cannot be      of any
help to the Council in this matter.




Yours faithfully

Dear Mrs Bashforth,

Hillsborough Inquest

I refer to your letter of the 24th August, 1992 and the enclosed copy
documentation relating to the applications for Judicial Review etc,
following the Hillsborough Inquest.

I can confirm that any additional costs incurred in carrying out a
Judicial Review would not be covered by any of the Council's Liability
Policies with us in force at the time of the Hillsborough Disaster.
The reasons for this are as follows

1.   The relationship of the Council to its appointed: Coroners is not
     the normal relationship of Employer and Employee. It is most
     easily considered as a "statutory office" to which the Council
     appoints and meets the salary and other expenses. ’Except in this
     narrow sense, the Council is not responsible for the conduct of
     the Coroner, who occupies an independent Judicial -Cppt

     Our Liability Policies operate in respect of claims against the
     Council and its Employees only.

2.   The Coroner enjoys the same qualified privilege as Judges and
     Magistrates and, therefore, cannot be sued in negligence.

     Our Liability Policies operate only in respect of claims brought
     in negligence.




                                                    Continued
3.    Judicial Reviews are not actions for compensation.

      Our Liability Policies provide Defence Costs cover provided there
      is at the same time a claim under the Policy for compensation
      following negligence.


For the above reasons, therefore, I am afraid we cannot be \    of any
help to the Council in this matter.




Yours faithfully

Dear sir

re: HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

I refer to previous telephone conversations and correspondence regarding
the various applications relating to the Hillsborough Inquest.

I should be grateful if you could inform me of the current position of
the various applications and what steps you now intend to take.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully




City Solicitor and Head of Administration

FILE NOTE

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I rang Malcolm Gregg and Co, the Solicitors acting for the applicants on the
Hillsborough Inquest, and the person dealing with the matter was not
available.  I therefore left a message asking if they could contact me to let
me know what the current position was regarding the various applications that
they had made regarding Squashing the Inquest verdicts and having new
Inquests. They confirmed that they would ring me back in response to my
query. They haven't but that may be because they are currently taking
instructions on the position.

NOTE OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION BETWEEN CHRIS DORRIES, THE CORONER, AND
LIZ BASHFORTH - 24 AUGUST 1992


Chris Dorries confirmed that he had heard the same rumour as myself that the
Attorney General had decided that the Fiat should not proceed.  He therefore
assumed that the application for judicial review should go ahead. I confirmed
that I had heard nothing from the Solicitors and that it was an ex parte
application at present, but that I would try and ascertain from the' Solicitors
what their intentions would be.

He also confirmed that he had no objection to the information being sent to
the insurers.

He also raised the issue of the application by Williams who had written
wanting various statements. They had been given statements where people
consented but there was one police officer whose statement they had requested
bat the policeman was refusing consent. The Coroner has written to the
Solicitors acting for Williams saying that it does not fall within rule 57
because the individual has not given their consent and therefore he does not
have to make a determination as to whether <?r not it is relevant. The
Williams' have also asked for copies of various photographs and the coroner
has no objection, provided the police have no objection and there is no
copyright infringement. The police are looking at the photographs to see
which ones they are and I think they will probably release them.'

The Coroner has a standard response which is that the police will generally
release photographs but gives the police the option to refuse, if appropriate.

I also pointed out that the majority of the photographs had been circulated at
the Hearing and therefore had been seen by individuals in any event.

Dear Ms Faal

HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

Further to our telephone conversation on 6 August 1992, I enclose
herewith a copy of the documentation in relation to the applications for
judicial review/the Inquest verdicts to be quashed/new inquests.

Once you have had an opportunity to consider the documentation perhaps we
can discuss what the position is vis a vis insurance, etc.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely          ^

Dear Chris

HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

I refer to your letter dated 16 June 1992 regarding the application made
to the Attorney General relating to the Hillsborough Inquest.

Although we have not had an opportunity to discuss the matter due to our
various commitments, I have kept a watching brief over the issue,
although there seems to be very little information available at present.

The only step I would suggest taking at present is to inform the insurers
of the applications and provide them with a copy of the documentation in
order that they can consider their position.

I will assume that you have no objection to this course of action and
make the appropriate arrangements unless I hear from you to the contrary
in the next few days.

If you have any further information or wish   to discuss the matter, please
give me a ring.

Yours sincerely




City Solicitor and Head of Administration

                 Dear Hike

                 HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

                 I have received a bundle of papers from Messrs Malcolm Gregg & Co, Solicitors
                 of Liverpool and enclose the same herewith for your attention.  I have
                 retained a copy of the application to the Attorney General and of the High
                 Court papers but not of the bundle of statements.

                 I am on leave for a week from this Friday (Majorca!) but suggest that we             have
                 a discussion about the situation shortly thereafter.

                 I did not manage to       speak to Stefan Popper about this before it became public
                 and he has not been       in touch with me since.

                 I look forward to hearing from you.




                 Yours sincerely

       Dear Sir

       Inquest into the Hillsborough Disaster - Judicial Review

       I refer to the telephone conversation between myself and your Miss Bashforth on
       the 3rd August, and write to confirm that the Chief Constable of the West
       Midlands has been advised by Messrs Malcolm J Gregg & Co, Solicitors for the
       Applicants in the above case, of their application and of the reference to the
       Attorney General under Section 13 of the Coroner's Act 1988.  The Chief Constable
       of the West Midlands has been invited to make representations  to the Court if and
       when the application for judicial review is renewed.

       I believe you are currently acting for the Coroner in responding to this
       application, and I would be grateful if you could advise me.,if and when the
       application is renewed,of the proposed response by the Coroner   so that I may
       further advise the Chief Constable whether any response is required on his
       part.

       I am grateful for your assistance.

       Yours faithfully

             Judicial Review of the Hillsborough Inquest:

             The High Court has powers to order judicial review of an inquest under Secdion
             13 of the Coroners Act 1988. It may do so on an application by or under t!he
             authority^of the Attorney General and such an application has already been
             made by Malcolm Greggj & Co., Solicitors for dhe applicant’s. The High Court;
             has powers to quash the inquisition on dhe first inquest, order a new inquest1
             held eidher by t'he original Coroner or a Coroner for another district in tihe
             same administration area, and order the original Coroner do pay costs
             incidental to the application as appears jusd. Alternatively, rather t'han
             order a new inquest, dhe High Court has powers do sdrike down dhe inquesds
O            findings without ordering a fresh inquesd as exercised by dhe Divisional Courd
             in the case of R. v. St. Pancras Coroners Courd ex parte Higgins 1988.

             The grounds for making eidher of the above order are where dhe Court is
             satisfied "thad (whet'her by reason of fraud rejecdion of evidence,
             irregularity of pleadings, insufficiency of inquiry, dhe discovery of new
             facts or evidence or odherwise) it1 is necessary or desirable in dhe inderest1
             of justice dhat another inquesd should be held" Section 13(i)(b) Coroners Acd
             1988. The application for relief in t'his particular case summarises dhe
             grounds and later describes in greater dedails dhe shordcomings of dhe
             original inquest:. Briefly the grounds are as follows:-

             1. The Coroner wrongly conducted dhe mini inquesds.
             2. The Coroner failed to comply with Rule 37 of dhe Coroners Rules, i.e.
                 introducing documentary evide
                                          evidence wit'houd firsd summarising it and asking
                 if there were any objecdions.
             3. The Coroner wrongly limited dhe scope of dhe inquesd by introducing a
                 cut off point of 3.15 p.m.
             4. The Coroner failed to call dwo widnesses dhat1 may have influenced dhe
                 Jury's decision.
             5. The Coroner did nod consider the quesdion of whedher lives could have been
                 saved by the emergency services acding more effecdively.
             6. The Coroner did nod advise thejury of dhe availability of dhe verdicd of
                 "lack of care".
             7. Some of dhe widnesses evidence were summarised, omiddirig vidal facds.

             As dhe verdicd reached by dhe Coroners jury was on dhe 28th March, 1991 and

             dhe grounds firsd arose (i.e. in this case the date of the verdicd). A late
             application may be allowed if the Court' is satisfied dhad there are good
             reasons for extending the time limit and that granding relief would nod cause
             substantial hardship to or substandially prejudice dhe rights of any person or
             would be detrimental to good adminisdradion. Where there is a delay the
             reason should be explained to the Courd in an affidavit. In this case dhe

Judicial Review' of the Hillsborough Inquest

The High Court has powers to order judicial review of an Inquest under Section
13 of the Coroners-Act 1988. It may do so on an application by or under the
authority of the Attorney General-and such an application has already been
made by Malcolm Gregg & Co., Solicitors for the applicants. The High Court
has powers to quash the inquisition on the first inquest, order a new inquest
held either by the original Coroner or a Coroner for another district in the
same administration area, and order the original Coroner to pay costs
incidental to the application as appears just. Alternatively, rather than
order a new inquest, the High Court has powers to-strike down the inquests
findings without ordering a fresh inquest as exercised by the Divisional Court
in the case of P. v. St. Pancras Coroners Court ex parte Higgins 1988.

The grounds for making either of the above order-are where the Court is
satisfied '^that (whether by reason^of fraud rejection of evidence,
irregularity of pleadings, insufficiency-of inquiry, the discovery of new
facts or-evidence or otherwise) it is necessary or desirable in the interest-
of justice that another inquest should be held"-Section 13(i)(b) Coroners Act
1988. The application for relief in this particular case summarises Che
grounds and later describes in greater details the shortcomings of the
original inquest. Briefly the grounds are as follows:-

1.   The Coroner wrongly conducted the mini inquests.
2.   The Corener failed to comply with Rule 37 of the Coroners Rules, i.e.
     introducing documentary evidence without first summarising it and asking
     if there were any objections.
3.   The Coroner wrongly limited the scope of the inquest by introducing a
     cut off point of 3.15 p.m. -
4.   The Coroner failed to call two witnesses that may have influenced the
     Jury's decision. • • -        -   .              -         ..
5.   The Coroner did not consider the question of whether lives could have been
     saved by the emergency services acting more effectively.
6.   The-Coroner did not advise the jury of the availability of the verdict of
     "lack of care".             -
7.   Some of the witnesses evidence were summarised, omitting vital facts.

As the verdict reached by the Coroners jury was on the 28th March, 1991 and
the application-for judicial review was made on the 15th April, 1992 the
applicants are technically out of time. An application for the judicial
review must be made promptly and no later than three months from-the date when
the grounds first arose (i.e. in this case the date of the verdict). A late
application may be allowed if the Court is satisfied that there are good-
reasons for extending the time limit and that granting relief would not cause
substantial hardship to or substantially prejudice the tights of any person or
would be detrimental to good administration. Where there is a delay the
reason should be explained to the Court in an affidavit. In this case the
application-for judicial review contains the affidavit of Jeremy Hawthorn,
Solicitor for the applicants in which there is a schedule of events in exhibit
marked "JJH/2" explaining why it took from the 28th March, 1991 to the 15th
April, 1992 to make an application.
To summarise the High Court: has power to make an order following an
application for judicial review out of time to quash a verdict reached by an
inquest provided the application satisfies She requirements for late
applications and the Court is satisfied that any of the grounds contained in
13(b) are present.

   if there were any objections.    -     . I .                '.
3. The Coroner wrongly limited the scope of the Inquest by introducing a
   cut off point of 3.15 p.m. -     . . .                         . . .
4. The Coroner failed to call two witnesses that may have Influenced the
   Jury's decision. -- -          -     .           - ,
5. The Coroner did not consider Che question of whether lives could have been
   saved by the emergency services acting more effectively.             >
6. The-Coroner did not advise the jury of the availability of the verdict of
   '•lack of-care"*             ^
7. Some of the witnesses evidence were summarised, omitting vital facts.
As the verdict reached by the Coroners jury was on the 28th March, 1991 and
the application for judicial review was made on She 15th April, 1992 the
applicants are technically out of time. An application, for the judicial
review must be made promptly and no lifter than three months from-the date when
the grounds first arose (i*e. in this case the date of the verdict). A late
application may be allowed if the Court Is satisfied that there are g o o d -
reasons for extending the time limit and that granting relief would not cause
substantial hardship to or substantially prejudice the rights of any person or
would be detrimental to good administration. Where there is a delay the
reason should be explained to the Court in an affidavit. In this case the
application for judicial review contains the affidavit of Jeremy Hawthorn,
Solicitor for the applicants in which there is a schedule of events in exhibit
marked "JJH/2" explaining why it took from the 28th March, 1991 to the 15th
April, 1992 to make an application.
To summarise the High Court has power to tsake an order following an
application for judicial review out of time to quash a verdict reached by an
Inquest provided she application satisfies the requirements for late
applications and the Court Is satisfied that any of the grounds contained in
13(b) are present.

              Dear Sirs

               Re:      Hillsborough Inquest

               We thank you for your letter of 22nd May 1992. We enclose herewith
               a copy of the Memorial submitted to the Attorney General, to which
               are attached two bundles of further material. In relation to Appendix
               1, in relation to the section dealing with Ian Glover, by an
               oversight the middle page of the letter from John Glover dated
               15th October 1990 was omitted. A copy of that middle page is separately
               enclosed which we have marked 50a for insertion into Appendix 1.
               Incidentally, in relation to this letter, we are not sure if Page
               3 has been correctly copied in the bundle and would be grateful
               if you would supply us with a copy of the Page 3 that you actually
               received.

               Omitted from the material sent to the Attorney General was the
               transcript of the "mini in qu es t11 of Ian Glover held on 4th May
               1990. We have submitted this to the Attorney General by separate
               letter.

               Also enclosed are copies of the Form 86A and the Affidavit in Support
               which comprise the application for Leave to Apply for a Judicial
               Review. As you are aware, that application stands adjourned pending
               a decision of the Attorney General on the Memorial.

                If we can assist you further at this stage please let us know.
                                                                                                  V

Following a conversation with the Coroner, I spoke to Mr. Gregg, Tel. No. 051
236 9055, the solicitor dealing with it, and agreed with him that he would get
their Counsel to explain to the Judge that they had forgotton the service and
in the circumstances he had agreed that the Coroner would therefore not be
attending the hearing or be represented.

I then agreed with Mr. Gregg he would serve the Coroner with the documents
and send us a courtesy copy indicating that prior to the conversation I had
been on the point of instructing London agents which would have simply
incurred costs to no profitable end, with which he agreed.

Ms Katherine Thorpe - Reynolds Porter Chamberlain,                     represent Eastwood & Partners.



Ms Norcliffe -    Hammond Suddards,        represents SY Police.


I want to introduce Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police and

he is acting as my C o r o n e r ’s Officer for the purposes of this meeting and also for the

purposes of the Inquests.
                                               -   2       -



The purpose of this meeting is to try and tell you some of the thinking which I have been
engaged in, the proposals which I have with regard to resuming the Inquests and toobtain
from the legal representatives, confirmation that what I am proposing would appear to be
an acceptable way forward.         I ought to make it clear, that I have had a preliminary
discussion with Mr Fraser and Mr Kennedy last week, with a view to exploring the very
subject which we are discussing today.             These are the 2 solicitors I have had most
                     •                     f   .       /   ^
correspondence with.


The second thing I want to say, the fact that we are meeting today and I am thinking,of
resuming the Inquests rather sooner that I had originally intended, does not mean that
the Director of Public Prosecutions has either informed me of any decisions or taken any
decisions with regard to this matter.


My Coroner’s Officer who is also heading up the Team which is preparing the paper work
for the DPP informs me that the Director at the moment is not able to take a decision
because all the paper work has not been delivered to him.


As you will note from the letter I sent to you, it is my intention subject to this
meeting to try and resume shortly after Easter.                The timing for that has got nothing
whatever to do with any action or inaction by the DPP.
                                                                                •
J
)   ■    •
             ’   ■       ■   ■



The present time schedule for submission of papers to the DPP is such that if we do
resume these Inquests shortly after Easter, the papers will not yet have been submitted
to the DPP in full.          The position will be exactly as it is today. It may be that whilst
we are proceeding with the Inquests, the papers will go to the DPP and indeed the
submission may well be completed.         We had considered something of this sort some time
ago and we rejected it because we were concerned that people might feel that there is
something going on which I’m not letting on about.                That is not the case.


The reason why I revised my opinion as to the possibility of resuming these Inquests, was
because we received a letter from Miss Steel, who is a member of the Hillsborough
Steering Committee, in which she had enclosed a letter which she actually wrote to the
DPP, and by chance we also had a letter from Hammond Suddards, who didn’t actually make
the same point but it was also raising points relating to timing and disclosure.                I
realised that what Miss Steel was saying was similar to my original thoughts and felt it
was appropriate to reconsider my earlier decision which was to do nothing until after the
DPP has answered.

                                                 -   3   -



      I want to indicate three possible scenarios before the Inquests.              Please listen to these
      bearing in mind what I have said as to my knowledge as to what the DPP is going to do.
      The first one is, having considered all the paper work and the evidence, he decides to
      bring a prosecution against somebody or bodies, corporate or otherwise, but he decides to
      bring a prosecution for a major offence which falls within Section 16, and the only one
      which is likely to apply is manslaughter.              If he were to bring such a charge, then the
      procedure under Section 16 of the Coroner’s Act is that I would adjourn the Inquest.                 At
      the end of the Town Hall proceedings, it would be my option whether I resumed the
 V l n q u e s t s or not."   It’s only fair to say that I’ve been Coroner now for about 4% years and
      I’ve never yet resumed an Inquest which was adjourned under Section 16.


      Scenario     two is the DPP says no prosecution but that one or more or some other person
      decides that they wish to bring a private prosecution against somebody corporate or
      otherwise.     If that were to occur and if a charge were laid,'then Section 16 would apply
      again with exactly the same consequences.


      The third scenario is that the DPP says no prosecution, and nobody else wants to proceed.
      In those cases, we would in a normal run of events, resume the Inquests and complete it
      within the ...... that I consider appropriate to the circumstances.


 ( I don’t know which of these scenarios will apply but if we were to resume before the DPP
 ...’makes a decision, and if a Section 16 situation were then to arise, I would immediately
      after resume the Inquests purely and simply for the purposes of               adjourning under the
      provisions of Section 16 in order to comply with the Act.              That   would be a formality but
      woulda’t take very long but in a sense, getting the information now, would have the
      advantage that we would be able to deal with it fairly quickly.               One of the reasons you
      adjourn under Section 16 is that families can get their death certificates               which they
      can’t normally do until the Inquest is complete.
Following receipt of Miss Steel’s letter and my reconsideration, I got in touch with the
DPP or one of his representatives, to see whether he would agree that I should resume the
 Inquests on a limited basis.    What I proposed to him was that we would resume for the
purposes of taking the medical evidence, and we would deal with the alcohol levels of the
 individuals at that time.    We would endeavour to put before my Court of where the
 deceased were within the Stadium and if possible, evidence of where they were seen either
 alive or dead at various points within the Stadium and probably, some evidence as to how
 they got to the Stadium.    We would not deal with how or why they died or who is to blame.
^The reason for this is:
                                                      t




 a) the DPP would not agree to me resuming the Inquests if we were to deal with
 controversial matters.     He would not agree if we dealt with matters which would impair
 his investigations or the scope for action which he might wish to take.     It is in the
 interests of justice that nothing I do should muddy the waters and perhaps hinder other
 proceedings which make take place in a different Court.


 If I resume these Inquests, they will be of a limited nature.     They will be designed to
 be non adverserial, to present the factual evidence.     The way I want the evidence
 presented to meet the legitimate requirements of everyone involved is as follows.


)We will deal with post mortems.     Some Inquests will require the Pathologist to be present
)others will only require documentary evidence.     We will discuss this with the
 Hillsborough Steering Committee and other relevant parties to determine whether the
 Pathologist is required.


 We will deal with the alcohol levels of the deceased.     They were all done apart from one,
 and we will tell you at the Inquests what the individual levels were. Dr Forrest will
 attend some of the Inquests to formally prove his evidence and if there is any individual
 case where the alcohol level might be controversial, we will ask Dr Forrest to attend.
 My intention is to hold a short Inquest for each individual deceased and complete the
 evidence as far as we are going.

 W Midlands Police are preparing the remainder of the evidence following Lord Justice
 Taylor’s report and the publication of the interim report and submission to the DPP.             The
  Inquest cannot be held until the DPP has. completed his work, so I said get the paper work
  done for the DPP, my documents can   come   later.    A file of   each   individual deceased will
  be presented to me containing copy   statements      together with a summary by one of the W
  Midlands’ Police Officers which will summarise, factually and non adverse'rially, the
  evidence of the witnesses.   We intend to present that summary to Court.
                                                '1

• .in order to help the legal representatives and the bereaved families, we intend to
  circulate the summaries before the particular Inquest to enable comments regarding
  inaccuracies or unclear statements, to be made to me via legal representatives.             If it
  is possible, we will either get the Summary Officer, who will be here and will be giving
  evidence, to elaborate on the particular point, or I might decide it is possible to get
  witness to deal with that point, or   we    will read a witness’ statement b} way of
  documentary evidence on that point.    Under no circumstances are we going to call any S
  Yorkshire Police Officer to the hearing.

The Officers will either themselves or possibly other W M i d l a n d s ’ Officers, will explain

to me the identification procedures and I am expecting to make use of plans where they

will indicate on the plan where a deceased was seen.        I do not intend to use the video in

the Court and I am going to be very reluctant to look at either video stills or

photographs.       Partly because it is logistically very difficult and partly because I d o n ’t

 think it is particularly helpful and because in many cases the photographs or video

 stills have already been seen by members of the family because they helped in locating

,and identifying some of the deceased.

\
 In summary, we want to have a limited Inquest, we vant to present the evidence in a

 particular form and we d o n ’t want to do anything which could possibly be construed as

    impeding the DPP or could constitute an attack or criticism of any person or persons or

    corporate/incorporate body.



    Are there any questions?


    Mr Fraser - the only question which you may come to    ...   .......   is the question of timing

    of the issuing of the summaries.    The logistics from our end would be, as I anticipate

    it, the solicitors will want to go through those summaries in some detail with families,

    for those families who want to see them,    and they will then have to report to yourself

! and to us and explain w hether or not they want to be here, 'what questions if any they
.'have to put. Those questions will have to be notified to Mr J o n e s ’ Officers and answers

    found if they are available.    So the logistics of that may occupy some time.       Is it
    possible when the summaries are complete to give an indication of when they might be

    issued?


    I an well aware that the more time I give you,    the easier it is.      All I can say is that !

    have got to read them first, but we will try and let you have them as soon as possible.

    Please bear in mind the limitations,    the summaries will be designed to give the factual

     evidence,   so you will know the names of the witnesses and you will know what they are

     saying with regard to that particular factual bit of evidence.
                                            - J   -



Mr Fraser - how far in terms of time do you anticipate the summaries will go, to the
point of identification or beyond, or not as far; as that?
                                  \                                                     .


I would expect that they would go at least up to the temporary mortuary and possibly up
to the point of identification.        The identification in a sense will be dealt with at the
opening so we may well stop at that point.            The objective is to trace each individual
from the moment he left home to the point in time when he was in the temporary mortuary.
We may not succeed but that is the intention.           We feel that is what you want to know.


We will probably have available but I don’t think we will circulate, documents called
anna-cappas, these are rather nice summary charts which have clocks on them and it is
easier from that to see where certain events occurred.            There will be a copy in Court on
the relevant day.


It would be unreasonable for people like Dr Forrest who did the blood alcohols, to sit
here for every Inquest, so what I intend to do is to ask Dr Forrest to come along on Day
1 and to prove formally to the Court, his evidence and to explain as far as is necessary,
the method used for the test.         We also want to have Inspector Leighton and may be one or
two others, who will explain the anna-cappas, the codings, etc.            I am also considering
asking probably Professor Usher to give an overview of the pathology of the type of
injury which occurred.
)
We are aiming to hold eight Inquests per day.            We want to have enough time so that each
individual family can feel that their particular loved one has been given full
consideration.   This means the duration is likely to be 2% to 3 weeks of sittings.
Clearly for each Inquest, it’s a relatively short period of time but for me and the legal
 representatives and for the Jury, it’s weeks of stress and it’s not fair to them to make
 this longer than it has to be.        But I don’t intend to rush it, they have to be as
 thorough and sympathetic within the limits I have indicated to you.           I want people to be
 able to leave at the end of the day and be able to say, well we know we haven’t heard all
 the answers, but we know more than we did when we started.

     The Inquests will not be held in numerical or alphabetical order.        The listing of the
     cases is a very difficult problem and I don’t think we have solved it.        I had made up my
     mind that we were going to do them in Pathologist order, in a sense that is still the
     order.   But in a few cases, more than one person died in a family, and because of the way
     their identifications were done and the way the post mortem was done, it wasn’t always
     the same Pathologist who dealt with family units.        For that reason alone, we will have to
     break the general order because I don’t want to deal with the same family on different
     days.    There are other factors that come into play.
 i

     I appreciate that it may be important to you, but the decision as to which order we are
     going to take the cases is going to be mine and my Officers.         We will certainly not want
     to inconvenience anybody deliberately,       I think itwill be an   impossible task to try and
     take individual preferences into account, or if we do take them into account, they would
     come at the bottom of the list.     We are conscious of where people live and that they have
     to come a long way in many cases.


     My initial intention was to hold the limited Inquests, assuming that we proceed, without
     a Jury being present.    I have reflected on this and despite the fact that the Jury at
     this stage will not have very much to do other than to listen, I feel that we will have
     to have a Jury present for each Inquest.         I think you should assume that we will be
     ^dealing with a Jury.   Even if this were an Inquest from start to finish, an Inquest        is
     not an adverserial procedure.     The job of the Jury is to reach a verdict on theevidence
     which they hear in the Court.


     I intend, assuming that we proceed, holding the Inquests here at the Medico-Legal Centre.
     I intend to arrange for the proceedings to be transcribed so that transcripts will be
     available in a reasonable time.     I don’t think there is any need for them to be available
     on a next-day basis.    Of course, they will have to be paid for.


     Do any of the lawyers think this is a non-starter?


     Mr Fraser - in view of your opening remarks, we have had an opportunity to discuss these
     proposals at some length and there is a general         ....   towards the idea and you are to
     be commended for putting forward the suggestions you have.
                                                ■ <§ -


     Are there any other legal representatives who have any other comments as to whethe r we

     should proceed on this basis?                         j



     I am well aware that there is a Hillsborough Support Group and I want you to feel that I

     w o u l d n ’t do anything to h arm or hinder your endeavours.   On the other hand,   I think we

     have got to have correct lines of communication.          Probably the right way of looking at

     this is to say the support groups are really family orientated.           I know that you have

     thought of other groups,    for example the Jury, who may need some support at some point in

I, the   future, but I am talking about the families now.         What I intend to do is, we will be
     listing hopefully when we anticipate the Inquests will be held and what we will probably

     do is give you a provisional date and try and confirm as soon as possible.            If somebody

     could be nominated from the Hillsborough Support Group,          I or my Officers woul d endeavour

     to inform you of the dates when a particular family will be involved.           Once we have done

     that, we would expect the solicitors to liaise with the Support Group.           The lines of    '

     communication should be through the solicitor rather than through the Coroner to relieve

     me of a certain amount of work.      It may well be if time allows that we will arrange for

     an informal meeting with the Hillsborough Support Group and myself and maybe the
     Officers.   If a family is informed of the Inquest and they do not arrive, we will proceed

     with the Inquest.
