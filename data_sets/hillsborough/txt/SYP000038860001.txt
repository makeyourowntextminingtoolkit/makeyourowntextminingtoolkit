        DCS 6930            Thank you.

        DCI 2514            Sorry 1990 (000090), I think Is...

                             apparently said 1989 (000089).

01.27   DCS 6930            At the conclusion of the interview

                            Mr SMITH I will give you a notice

                            explaining what will happen to the

                             tapes we mentioned to you earlier.

                             Do you understand that?

        PES                 Yes thank you.

01.38   DCS 6930            On the 15th of April 1989 (150489) a

                             disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                             Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                             Following a public inquiry and report

                             the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire

                             Police consulted with the Director of

                             Public Prosecutions and as a result

                             the West Midlands Police were

                             requested to do a criminal

                             investigation.     This investigation

                             came at the same time that certain

                             members of the public decided to make

                             specific allegations against named

                             police officers.    You are one of those

                             officers and you have already been

02.11                        served with Regulation 7 Notices

                             dealing with those specific

                             complaints. The nature of those

                             complaints and the particular duty

                             you were performing at Hillsborough
SMITH              PETER   EDWARD                                      4


                            on the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                             suggests that you may have

                            contributed to the deaths of some of

                             those that died.   Also that you may

                             have failed to perform your lawful

                             duty as a police officer on the 15th

                            of April 1989 (150489) at

                            Hillsborough.    I will explain the

                             specific allegations to you in

                             interview but do you now understand

                             the nature of this interview which

                             raises matters of both a criminal and

                             a disciplinary nature.     Before you

                             answer I need to formally caution you.

2.52                         You do not have to say anything

                             unless you wish to do so, but what

                             you say what you do say may be given

                             in evidence.   Do you understand the

                             purpose of the interview?

3.01    PES                  Yes sir.

        DCS 6930             I would remind you that you are not

                             under arrest and you need not remain

                             here unless you wish to do so.       In

                             addition, you are entitled to the

                             legal representation that you have

                            with you in the form of Mr HOLROYD,

                             and it is right that I would in any

                            event give you this right of legal

                             aid notice that applies.    Do you


                                                                           348
SMITH              PETER   EDWARD


                            understand what I've just said?

        PES                 I do sir.

        DCS 6930            Thank you.

3.26    DCS 6930             Right if we can just go through a few

                            preliminaries first really.     Do you

                            agree that you submitted for the

                            benefit of the public inquiry and to

                            the West Midlands Police a statement

                            of recollection as which you would

                            call it dated the 29th of April 1989

                             (290489)?

3.45    PES                 Yes sir.

        DCS 6930            Do you also agree that you gave

                            evidence to the public inquiry at

                            Sheffield in respect of the disaster

                            and that evidence was given by you to

                            that inquiry and then put into the

                             form of a transcript?

        PES                 Yes sir.

        DCS 6930            It may well benecessary to refer to

                            one or other of those during the

                            course of this interview and there

                            are copies therefore if you wish to

04.17                       refer to them.     A number of photo­

                            graphs were taken, PC SMITH in respect

                            of what took place that that may

                            feature you.     There are I think just

                            three that I would to try and get some

                            confirmation of and Police Constable
SMITH              PETER EDWARD


                           BROWN will find the exact documents

                           but I think that they are come under

04.39                     Document 155 and Photographs 8, 9 and

                           10, and if Police Constable BROWN

                           would just show the original album

                           could you just confirm that these

                           photographs show yourself and perhaps

                           you could describe for me where you

                           are.     If we can look at number 8 first,

04.59                     Document 155 Photograph number 8.

                           (Pause)

05.09   PES               I would imagine that that is me on the

                           bottom right-hand c ---

        DCS 6930          Yourself on the bottom right-hand

                           comer is a possible?

        PES               Yeh.

        DCS 6930          Okay, you have been shown Document 155

                           which is a photograph and the

                           photograph number is number 8.     The

                           second one is the same document,

05.33                     Document 155, and it's Photograph

                           number 9.    Do you see yourself there?

05.40   PES               Sir it's possibly at the bottom right-

                           hand side.

        DCS 6930          Possibly at the bottom right-hand

                           side.    You'll see a Superintendent I

                           think on the, just to the left of

                           there.    Does that give you any help

                           in recollection?
SMITH                PETER EDWARD


        PES                 No, none at all.

        DCS 6930            It doesn't.

        PES                 Not in, not in I can't even recognise

                             who it is.

        DCS   6930          Okay that's fine.    And the   final one

                             I think for the time being again

06.00                       shewing you Document 155, Photograph

                             10A, and I think there are two police

                             officers, one is a Superintendent.

                             Is there any possibility that that

                             is yourself on the right?

06.13   PES                 Yeh, every possibility I would imagine.

        DCS   6930          Every possibility.

        PES                 Having said ...     (pause)

                             I would favour that one though sir.

        DCS   6930          You would favour that one.Now we're

06.40                       looking at Photograph number 1QA of

                             that same document and there is a

                             picture of two police constables both

                             near the gate to gates number 3 which

                             is open and you are suggesting you are

                             the lower in the picture of the two

                             officers where you can just see the

                             helmet and the head.

06.58   PES                 Yes sir.

        DCS   6930          Thank you.

07.06   DCS 6930            I'd like to start firstly just going

                            back to a not particularly to do with

                             experience of shall we say monitoring

        DCS 6930            I think it was yes.   I think in fact

                             before that the it would have been

                             1981 (000081), so you probably didn't

                             got much experience of capacity crowds

        PES               Yes, they'd they'd start filling up

                           round the sides.

        DCS 6930          Yes.

        PES               Then they'd go to the top of the ...

        DCS 6930          The pais.

        PES               Would be open as well as the gates

                           from the tunnel.

        DCS 6930          So now we're talking about the gate

                           right at the back of the terraces

                           below the seating?

        PES                 Yes.

        DCS 6930             So people can walk across from all the

                             away across the terraces in fact?

        PES                  Yes sir.

        DCS 6930            And that's how they'd slowly filter

                             and go in?

        PES                  Yes sir.

15.25   DCS 6930             Okay.   I think is it right to say that

                             that system is normally used where

                             there were perhaps originally segreg­

                             ated crowds for different matches

                             whereas perhaps the difference here

                             was the fact that it was all one team?

        PES                  Yes.

        DCS 6930             And that would make a difference?

        PES                  Yes sir.

        DCS 6930             Now I think that's what you're

                             talking about.

        PES                  Yes.

        DCS 6930             Thank you.     So we're happy that you

                             can recollect nothing in terms of

                             that tunnel being closed because of

                             problems in pen three and four.     It's

                             always been done as a way of of

                             filling up individual pens depending

                             on the game.     Thank you.

                     of disruption to the people round the

                     ground etc.   The things that would

                     stick out in my mind are the fact that

                     we would told that we weren't to do

                             the same location?

        PES                 Yes.    Mr DUCKENFIELD's was more a broad

        PES               and perhaps PC CUCKSON ...

        DCS 6930          Yes.

        PES               it would be, but having said that PC

                          CUCKSON didn't particularly do that

                          the fencing at that end of the ground,

                          he was more on the comer of the North

                          Stand.

        DCS 6930          Mm.

        PES               PC RICHARDSON would more, Ithink,

                          originally sat in front of the seated

                           area on the South Stand.

        DCS 6930          Yes I see.   You went for your meal

                           and I think as you've said there was

                           a bit of a delay because it was closed

                           or whatever reason,

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          and you eventually came back at what

                           time?

31.32   PES                Quarter to two (1345), ten to two

                           (1350) sir, ten to three (1450),

                           quarter to three (1445).

        DCS 6930          Quarter to two (1345), to ten to three

                           (1350), but there's no way you can be

                           exact on that?

        PES                No sir.

        DCS 6930           You came back at the same time as PC

                           ILLINGWORTH or just a little bit

                           sooner.

        PES                Probably I think PC ILLINGWORTH

                           arrived shortly before I did, but not

                           I made a call on the way back sir.

32.04   DCS 6930           When you got back at around two forty

                           five (1445), two fifty (1450), can you

                           then recall how many other officers

                           were on that perimeter track in front

                           of Leppings Lane?

        PES                I was there with PC ILLINGWORTH and

                           I seem to think PC HELLIWELL was

                           possibly still there, I can't be, I


                                                                         375

                            seem to think I spoke to PC HFn'iTJWELL.

                            I couldn't be certain on that sir, but

                            other than that I can't recall anybody

                            else being there but that's not to say

                            there wasn't sir.

        DCS 6930            No okay then.    What I'd like to do now

                            is just take you through your

                            at the present time.    Thank you Mr

                             HOLROYD.

        DCS 6930             Yes can I, before I actually take you

33.43                        through your statement, Inspector

                             DARLING and Sergeant CHAPMAN who

                            were the supervisory officers for

                             that particular Serial, do you

                             recollect them at any time prior to

                             Leppings Lane end of the ground?

33.57   PES                  Certainly Inspector DARLING was,

                             yes.

        DCS 6930             He was.    Can you tell me approximately

                             when, are we talking prior to two

                             o'clock (1400) when you're out for

                             refreshment?

        PES                  I would think it was about two

                             o'clock (1400) sir, yeh.

        DCS 6930             Prior to two o'clock (1400).

        PES                  I think it was, yeh.

        DCS 6930             Okay.   What about Sergeant CHAPMAN?

34.17   PES                  I can't recall seeing Sergeant

                             CHAPMAN no.

        DCS 6930             You can't?

        PES                  At that end of the ground, no sir.

        DCS 6930             When you came back at around quarter

                           you recall either Inspector DARLING

                           or Sergeant CHAPMAN being at that

                           end of the ground then?

        PES               I don't recall it sir, but again

                           that's not to say they weren't.

        DCS 6930          No.     It doesn't particularly ring a

                           bell with you?

        PES               No sir.

        DCS 6930          No. Okay then.

34.42   DCS 6930           If I can take you through some parts

                           of your statement, you actually have

                           already said you placed your stool

                           at around gate four.     I'm actually

                           referring now to the statment

                           recollection submitted by the officer

                           to the Public Inquiry,

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          and that's at page 3on actually on

                           your one there, just about the fifth

                           line down, you place your stool at

                           gate four.

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          Right.    Further down towards the

                           bottom you go through the last but

                           one paragraph going through explaining

                           about going for a meal.

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          Right, and if we can follow that

                          through to the next page which is the
SMITH              PETER EEWARD


                           fourth page there, you exactly say at

                           the very top the two centre pens

                           behind gates three and four had filled

                           considerably while you were away, so

                           you've now arrived back and you've

                           noticed a considerable difference in

                           the two central pens.

        PES                Yes sir.

35.53   DCS 6930           Was that something that was unusual

                           from your experience and I accept

                           that you were possibly only there on

                           one previous Semi-Final when you

                           talk about there was no gap in the

                           centre pens then?

        PES                No not at all, it it it has   in the

                           past been noticeable that the two

                           centre pens do fill up first.    I think

                           it's because they're behind the goal

                           ... and it's not particularly unusual.

        DCS 6930           So that would not have been   an alarm

                          bell to you in any way?

        PES                No sir.

36.25   DCS 6930          Going further down there just before

                          half way, if you can see where it says

                           'I walked back towards gate three and

                          saw a group of fans numbering 20 to

                          30 jumping up and down pushing,

                          causing surging etc.' Can you see

                          that?
SMITH              PETER EDWARD                                        36


        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          'This group were positioned about

                           half way down the terracing to the

                           left of gate three as I looked at

                           them.'

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          What was your impression on seeing

                           that of the crowd?

        PES               They were happy and apart from that

                           they were behaving quite normally, er

                           there was plenty of room to be moving

                           about and what for them to be able to

                           do that.

        DCS 6930          Okay then.    So we're then talking

                           around this is within a couple of

                           minutes of you getting back.

        PES               Yes sir.

37.16   DCS 6930           Can I ask, just I'd just like to

                           show you a video that that may

                           assist you at around that time.      It's

37.24                     actually Document number 128.     Police

                           Constable BROWN will put the video on

                           and I'd like to come around to about

                           1450, 1455, just to see if this

                           assists in the sort of visual

                           description that you've just that

                           you've described in your statement at

                           that time.   If you can look at the top

                           right-hand comer, it shows 1450 and


                                                                            380
SMITH              PETER EDWARD                                      37


                           gate three as you can see on that

                           bottom right.   Is that the sort of

                           general view that it that you recall?

        PES                As well as I could from where I was

                           stood then the the aerial shots always

                           give a different view to what it looks

                           like when you're, actually stood down.

                           What I actually see when I'm stood

                           down there is is more more more that

                           they're just moving.

        DCS 6930          Yeh.

        PES               You know.

        DCS 6930          So your view really is probably what

                           at sort of, if you were looking at

                           that crowd you'd be looking if you're

38.44                     looking straight ahead, how far back

                           up the terraces do you think a sort

                           of eye view would be?

        PES               Possibly half way up w... would be

                           immediately to your what you're

                           looking at, if you start going higher

                           up your attention starts being drawn

                           to what people are doing on the stand

                           above it.   It's very difficult to say.

        DCS 6930          Okay.

        PES               Obviously    the fencing itself obscures

                           your views to some degree.

        DCS 6930          Okay, can you stop the video now.

                           We've now stopped the video Document


                                                                          381

                             128.    You're quite right, that is

                            obviously a very different view to

                            what you would have had, and the

                            reason I wanted to show it to you

                            because you do describe then what

                            appears to be a a group of people,

                            thirty jumping up and down, causing

                            surging to the front but as far as

                            you were concerned did that cause any

                            alarm to you?

        PES                 Certainly not the the people at the

                             front, it certainly weren't affected

                            at all by that.

        DCS 6930            No.

        PES                 No it certainly didn't, it was a

                             fairly usual football crowd scene.

        DCS 6930            Right.     What I'm trying to get at is

                            to say that that video to some extent,

                            albeit from a different angle, at

39.56                       around 1451 would tend to show that

                            people were reasonably happy at that

                            time.

        PES                 Yes I I think I've seen one that

                            would show it better, but yes.

        DCS 6930            Yeh.     To keep, does that, I mean if

                            you want to use that or refer to it.

        PES                 (Mumbling) I can't remember which one

                            it is.

        DCS 6930            Okay.      I mean we will, we will be


                                                                           382

                           having a break shortly anyway to

                           give you a time to think about that

                           if you want to bring it back.     What

                           I'd like to do now is show you

40.34                      three photographs which are in fact

                           from Document number 162 and after

                           the first two are document ...

                           photograph numbers 28 and 29.     The

                           first one is taken at 1452.      If you

                           can have a look at this one PC

                           SMITH.   So it's Document 162,

                           Photograph number 28, and I think if

                           you look at that can you see the

                           time clock on this top left-hand

                           comer which shows 1452.

        PES               Are we satisfied that that's right?

        DCS 6930          Well that, there are differences in

                           terms of what is the BBC time and

                           that is obviously the, the Club

                           clock time.   Is there anything in

41.29                     that photograph if we say that it

                           could be a minute out either side, it

                           may well be more?   Is there anything

                           in that photograph there, it's not a

                           particularly perhaps clear one, that

                           would cause you any concern at 1452?

                           (Viewing photograph).

42.16   PES                I don't think so, no, no.

        DCS 6930          Could you have a look at the next

                           one which is again from Document 162

                           and the officer is now looking at

42.26                      Photograph number 29, and if you look

                           at the same clock it's now timed at

                           1454.   Is there anything there that

                           would cause you any alarm and again

                           this is accepting that these

                           photographs are taken at a very very

                           different angle to what you would

                           have been privy to?

                           (Viewing photograph).

43.12   PES               No I can't see there is particularly,

                           no.

        DCS 6930          How would you describe the crowd frcm



        PES               Possibly bottom right-hand comer is

                           that?

        DCS 6930          How you yourself describe those two

                           as far as the crowd were concerned?

        PES               It it's certainly a great deal denser

                           in the centre two than it is on the

                           first pen underneath the Control Box.

44.03   DCS 6930          Any problem with those central pens

                           as far as you're concerned?

                           (Slight pause).

44.27   PES               It's a difficult question to answer

                           sir 'cause I know what happened.

        DCS 6930          Yes that's right.

44.39                       I think as the tape is now coming to

                            an end if we can agree that it is

                            1054 and that we can terminate this

SMITH              PETER EDWARD


                           and say that firstly that you are

01.06                      still under caution.   May I remind

                           you of that.

        PES               Yes sir.

        DCS 6930          We have just been looking at two

                           photographs, Document numbers once

                           from Document number 162 Photograph

                           numbers 28 and 29, and I asked you

                           really just for your opinion of them.

                           Could I ask you to look in the same

01.25                      document 162, at the very first

                           photograph, Document number 1 which

                           is a very similar shot, it's not a

                           very clear picture but it's actually

                           timed on the same clock at 1459 and

                           it's from a very different angle.

                           If you consider all three photographs

                           do you see any marked difference in

                           terms of the crowd within that seven

                           minute period?

                            (Short pause)

02.09   PES                Yes it's certainly very crowded sir.

                           The impression you get from the first

                           picture is that it's certainly very

                           crowded towards the front, but

                           whether that's just some ---

                           number 1 you're saying looks quite

                            crowded, bearing in mind that there is

                             a reflection from the camera possibly

                             of the sun.

        DCS 6930             Okay thank you.

02.37                         I think you mentioned earlier to us

                              that in terms of video that I'd

                              showed you that you would like to

                              refer to another part of the video

                              that perhaps describes the crowd

                              scene.

        N HOLROYD             If if I can help there.

        DCS 6930              Yes.

        N HOLROYD             I think the point that the officer's

                              referring to is somewhere round

                              twenty to two (1340) on the same

                              vid... sorry twenty to three (1440)

                              on the same video, Document 128.

03.06   DCS                   That's Mr HOLFOYD speaking and Police

                              Constable BROWN could you put us that

                              video on which is Document 128 and

                              just go to around that time at about

                              twenty to three (1440) and we can

                              view that.   If I can recap while

                             we're doing that, that I particularly

                              asked that question in terms of your

                              view when you arrive back at around

                              two fifty (1450).   Would it be true

                           sort of banana thing jumping up and

                           down.   Is this is this part of the

                           slow down now.    That's now at about

                           1440 which is possibly between five

                           and ten minutes before you arrive

                           back.   Is that the area that you

                           wished us to consider?

        PES               I think what what what I was after

                           bringing out was the fact that how

                           far this surging was taking place.

                            it's very likely, in fact almost

                             at 1455.     Now we've got a shot of the

07.48   DCS 6930             If I can just explain again for the

                             benefit of the audio, we're looking

                             at that document, there is a very

                             short piece of video here at 1455,

                             at 1455.45, and you are actually

                             pointing out there's quite a surge

                             from the back of the Leppings Lane

                              and the tape is now being switched

                             off.     Can you explain to me Mr SMITH

        DCS 6930             28 and 29.     You haven't looked at a

                            closed the gate immediately and no

                             one tried to get out." I am going

                             on to the next page, "I assume the

        PES                 Yes sir.

                             sir.

        DCS 6930            Yes.     Was there anything at that

                             time that made you think, bearing in

                             mind earlier that you said that you'd

                             moved so that young children or what­

                             ever frcm there in terms of

                             overcrowding that made you think

                             there was a problem in those terraces

                             then?

        PES                 No sir, because the the gates had

                             flown open on previous occasions and

                             it didn't really overly concern me

                             to do so again once people had moved

                             back and were stuck.    No.

11.25   DCS 6930            I know you've described this

                             but can you explain how those gates,

                           fits into the ...    into another catch

                           is actually shaped at an angle so that

                           any pressure would make it fall out.

        DCS 6930          It just jumps out?

        PES               Yeh it just jumps out sir.

        DCS 6930          Okay.   You actually do say in

                           fairness then that there was no

                           great pressure on the fans at the

12.10   DCS 6930          When that gate opened did anybody

                           try to get out that you can recall?

                           allegations against you are that

                           when that gate three did open that

                           in fact you allegedly pushed people

                           back in without realising that there

                           was an overcrowing situation.     Do

                           before we finished we were going

                           through one or two things around your

                           duties around the perimeter gate side.

                           What I'd like to start off with is

                           before I ccroe onto the specific

                           allegations that there are quite a

                           number of people who have praised

                           the officers at those on that

                           perimeter track and the gates, quite

                           a considerable number, for example,

                           if I can bring one up to you you may

                           even know this chap actually, he's a

                           in fact on that area very quickly saw

                           what was happening and assisted a lot

                           start off with we we mentioned a few

                           photographs earlier on that you refer

                           to which was the Photographs numbers

                           28, 29 and number 1 again.          I think

                           what is important to perhaps clarify

02.53                      is this firstly, that your view and

                           and particularly when you talk about

                           what took place that the view of

                           those photographs is a lot different

                           to yours, but perhaps the thing to

                           emphasise is, when you stand on that

                           perimeter track you're not actually

                           looking directly at the people at the

                           front, you are actually looking

                           probably at least a third of the way

                           back at eye level.

03.21   PES                Yes eye level, yes.

        DCS 6930          Yes, so people at the very front would

                           not particular be, if they were in

                           distress, would not necessarily be

                            you to sort of be looking down, you

                            would more be looking across the crowd

                             at a general angle, it's not very

                             often people look downwards.

                             make that point earlier on but perhaps

                             it it's something I didn't pick up on.

                             it's obviously important that if if

                             talk to you in a minute we are talking

                             about the people perhaps towards the

                             clear what your vision was ...

                           occasion was purely because we'd got

                           a new Chief Superintendent.

        DCS 6930            Yeh okay.    I mean one of one of the

                             specific people that made the

16.31                       complaint, Mr HENDRY, who says that

                             and you've said, I mean he said that

                             they were sort of shouting at the

                            policeman at gate three, "Open the

                             gate let us out," and you've said how

                            people were saying that they're being

                             squashed.   He says that you were you

                            were shouting to them to push back but

                            what he's actually saying is that you

                            wouldn't open the gate at that stage.

                             Can you put that into any order, is it

                             possible you shouted to them to push

                             back before the gate was opened?

        PES                 Possibly, yeh, Idon't know.

        DCS 6930            It's possible.

        PES                 Yeh.

        DCS 6930            I mean I know it's it's seme time ago

                             now, but you obviously you you agree

                             that you were shouting people to push

                            back an' push back, but what you're

                             saying is that you opened the gate in

                             any event at the earliest possible

                            opportunity.

17.19   DCS 6930            Right.   The same man Mr HENDRY,

                             specifically refers to yourself when

                            he says that a supporter presumably


                                                                           412

                           his belt and pushed back over the

                           about to throw them over that fence.

        DCS 6930           No.

        PES                It would an impossibility for me to do

                           so.

        DCS 6930           And how high do you describe that

                           fence as?    I mean I know it's on the

                           video but ...

        PES                I would imagine it's nine, ten foot.

        DCS 6930           Nine, ten foot.

        PES                from the ground from where I'm stood

                           and certainly a lot higher from their

                           side.

        DCS 6930           You'd actually have to climb up the

                           fence.

18.02   PES                Well to see over the top I would have

                           to be stood on the advertising

                           hoardings,

        DCS 6930           Yeh.

        PES                and even then I don't think I could

                           see like a clear view.

        DCS 6930           Right over then.   So you say that

                           that would be a very difficult thing.




                                                                         413

                             have done with people coining over that

                             could be interpreted that you were

                             somebody back?

18.29   DCS 6930             Did I hear you right earlier that you

                             may well have stopped people coining

                             over because you were trying to get

                             them out the other way?

        PES                  Through the gate itself.

        DCS 6930             Yeh.

18.38   PES                  People were actually coining over the

        PES                  There certainly was yeh.

                            The other chap that made the similar

                            allegations was a chap called Mr

19.06                       LACKEY, LACKLEY, he again says that

                             he feels that you could have opened

                             that gate and should have opened that

                             gate when they were asked, because it

                            would have helped to to save sane of

                             lives of those supporters but are you

                             adamant that you actually opened that

                             gate at the earliest possible

                             opportunity?

19.31   PES                  Yes and I think in any similar

                             same.

                             At that time I I wasn't aware what was

                             actually pushed one lad back into the

19.58                      you're saying to me is that yeh that

                           is a possibility pushing people into

                           that gate, back through gate three,

                           but that the the reason you were

                           doing it was to get sane sort of

                           semblance of order at getting people

                           out because you couldn't get them

                           out.

20.10   PES               The on.. yeh the only, my only

                           thoughts at that time were the people

                           that down on floor, not the people

                           that were managing to climb up and

                           round into the gates and over the top

                           of us.

20.19   DCS 6930          Yeh, can I just pursue that because

                           right at that gate we now know that

                           there were people lying perhaps two,

                           three, four deep down and others

                           coming across the top, and what

                           you're saying is that you were

                           concerned for those lying down and

                           trying to get them out and that

                           people coming over the top were

                           stopping you - because there's such

                           a narrow entrance you were pushing

                           people back to try and relieve the

                           situation at the front.

                             no chance of, having said that at

                             that stage I wouldn't have realised

                             pushing people back, it's quite

                             problem was that perhaps supporters,

                             perhaps was.    I would suspect that

                             people in that crowd would be

                             expecting the gates to be be and

                             perhaps more of them which would

                             perhaps explain people expecting us

                             to open the gate that wasn't there.

                             happened?

24.32   PES                  Well later on there were a number of

                             pulling people up and down.    I can

                             imagine that the way to pull somebody

                             out over that fence is to get get

                             hold of the collar and I think pull

        DCS 6930            No. Had you ever envisaged that the

                             reason that you were doing it was to

                             deal with somebody that was injured

                             or it was brought to your notice

                             somebody was injured/ and let's say

                             sort of action would you have taken?

        PES                 I think the only thing I could do

                             was to notify the Control Room of

        DCS 6930          Have you got any knowledge or any have

SMITH              PETER   EDWARD


                            you have thought that perhaps the

                             stewards had a responsibility there

                             or did you feel that it was the

                             responsibility yourself?

        PES                  I think er, it's very difficulty

                             objective really, I think basically I

33.01                        think ray my assumption would have been

                             that access to the ground was was

                             limited by the turnstiles which would

                             lead to a situation whereby there was

                             no overcrowding and that that that the

                             fact that there is a crowd limit on

                             the ground ...

        DCS 6930            Mm.

        PES                 would leave me to assume that a

33.19                       serious overcrowding situation would

                             not occur ...

        DCS 6930            Yes.

        PES                 It may sound blase' but that wouldn't

                             be my understanding at that time,

                             that time.

        DCS 6930            Just going back to cover one or two

                             little areas now, you actually said I

                             think when you asked for permission to

                             open the gate you actually said,

33.34                       "People are dying."   Do you remember

                             saying that?

        PES                 I've certainly gone through on the
SMITH              PETER EDWARD


                           radio later and said that but I'll

                           have to ...

        DCS 6930           Do you remember exactly when that was?

                           Would it have been ...?

33.48   PES                It'd been after after the gates after

                           the gates were opened I got up on the

                           fence and wait back, possibly when I

                           I took them to one side and had

                           another look at the fencing then

                           people started to turn blue on the

                           fence.

        DCS 6930          Again, in fairness, your your

34.01                     statement recollection says that gate

                           three was open fully, you saw people

                           were forced in and you passed another

                           radio message saying, "This is serious

                           people are are dying." That's on page

                           five of your statement recollection

                           two thirds of the way down, so as far

                           as you can recollect ...

        PES               Yeh it'd be about that time that it's

                           very difficult ...

34.23   DCS 6930           Can I summarise that then that you you

                           recognised a problem, you've asked

                           permission to open the gates, you've

                           got no response and within seconds

                           you've opened that gate and you've

                           started to help people or to try and

                           get some people out.

        DCS 6930            You've then gone back on your radio

                             and specifically told the control

                             that it is very serious, people are

34.59                        certainly I know PC HELLIWELL said

                             after me that'd he'd heard me say

                             this is serious and then then he said

                             I cut out so I don't know, I just

                             don't know what they received.    He he

                             certainly received on the talk-through

                             this is serious and he knew it was me

                             'cause he's known me a long time.

        DCS 6930            Yes.    Superintendent GREENWOOD was

        PES                  Yeh.

        DCS 6930            Okay then, so but but until that time

                             you had been continually engaged in

                             if you like the, the file of releasing

                             people and bringing them out ...

                             time.    I know you —

        PES                 Well eventually there were just that

                             many policemen there that you couldn't

                             get near.

        DCS 6930             Mm mm.


                                                                            434

        PES                 And at that time ... that was it

        DCS 6930            Okay.     Mr SMITH you you've heard me

                            put to you a number of things,

                            specifically the allegations that that

                             form the notice of the two Regulation

38.58                        7 Notices, the first one from Mr

                            HENDRY and the second one from Mr

                            LACKEY.     I I've covered as much as I

                            think is relevant.     Is there anything

                            that you want to add and tell me now

                            additional to what we've explained and

                            gone through that you feel is

                             important in response, firstly to the

                            overall thing and, secondly, to those

                             specific allegations?

                             (Pause)

39.37   PES                 Just that I think basically if I think

                             if I did know what was going to happen

                            that day that everybody would have

                            been sat on the pitch at half past two

                             (1430), and if I'd have got the vision

                            of the forward vision yeh, there are a

                            lot of things I could have done but

                            basically that I've done everything I

                            could tell everybody and it will be

                            the greatest regret for the rest of

                            my life of what happened that day.

        DCS 6930            Okay then, well that's fine an' it's

                            just just to remind you, a lot of


                                                                            435
SMITH              PETER EDWARD                                       92


                           people have said how well, not just

                           yourself but other officers, worked

                           to obviously save a lot of life.     The

                           situation is then that that the facts

                           of these allegations and the incident

40.23                     will be reported to the Director of

                           Pros... Public Prosecutions and it

                           will be a matter for him to decide

                           whether there should be any action

                           taken against you in terms of criminal

                           offences.    Do do you understand?

                            draw your attention to the caution at

                            the bottom, that it says you are not
