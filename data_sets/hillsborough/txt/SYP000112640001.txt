Penistone Road             heavily          c o ngested w ith fans             entering          ground.     Due to

park    via Catchfoar Lane,                  P a r k s i d e Road.          As we    turned onto Leppings

Lane    I saw a heavy            build up of fans who were                          very noisy wit h

continuous         streams       of fans           still     approaching            the ground along

P e n i s t o n e R o a d North.           M any of these were                 rushing     towards       the ground

in obvious         attempts          to enter as soon as                    passible.        Fro m where      1 was

walking          I could see         that       the entire        driveway        leading       to the entrances

to the ground from                this      side were           totally     packed w ith         people.           I

c ould see the P o l i c e L a n d Rover                   parked oh the           perimeter          of the       crowd

and      could     plainly hear            its    public a d d r e s s      sy s t e m in o p e r a t i o n a n d

as    people were            being    s q u a s h e d at    the    front        of the    turnstiles.              It was

obvious          that m a n y    of the         suppo r t e r s were       taking, no notice and                  I could

hear      some jeer i n g at          the appeals.               Many    of the        s u pporters      in this

a re a    seemed to be the w o r s e                  for drink.         I was     unable       to assist          due to

the      sheet     numb e r s and         the    fact I was         in plain        clothes.          Upo n      looking

around      I could see            numerous           supporters        on C a t c h b a r Lan e who were               on

the      roof of the Po l i c e            section house           and     others who were             climbing          up

adjoining          b u i l d i n g s and trees.            I went w i t h        the    int e n t i o n of       removing

these      for sa f e t y       reasons whilst             en route        back     to H i l l s b o r o u g h    car    pari*

Upon      reaching        the H i l l s b o r o u g h     car    park a rea we a g a i n          liaised with

the Park          patrol      officers who             stated their         section was           only     three

qu a r t e r s    full    and    ever y t h i n g      there was all            in order.        We    then moved

on thro u g h the            centre       of the Park           heading     for     the second         car       park

situ a t e w i th i n        the Park       at the H awks ley Avenue                   entrance.

Whilst we were               head i n g    for the       second      car    park       I heard numerous

emergency           vehicle      sirens         and    saw Poli c e /Amb u l a n c e       vehicles        heading

al o n g P e n i s t o n e    Road    towards the           direction           of the ground.            At this

              ACCOUNT OF PETER EUGEN DRAJLING TDC 1181 HAMMERTON ROAD CID , SHEFFIELD.
                             C Under command of X Bet. Stipt, McKay.)

0900 Hours , Saturday 15th April 1989 « on duty Hammerton load CID office in connection with
duties to be wofcked at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground the event being the FA Cup
Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Football Clubs.
0955 Hours attended in North Stand at SWFC together with other CID Officers for general
briefing to all Officers. Dressed in Plain clothes ; Blue Jacket , Grey trousers , grey
sweater f pale yellow shirt , black shoes.
1040 Hours paised up with PC Moulding C E2 CID Aide ) for observations in connection with
theft of and from motor vehicles from Hillsborough Car park y this in turn being situate
within Hillsborough Park , access gained via Parkside Road nearto its junction with Penistone
load. This duty scheduled to be woiked before y during and after the game. This duty to be
worked m foot 9 one radio between two of us which was tuned in to channel 19 which was being
monitored by a Mobile CID communication vehicle*
At time shown I left the Ground on foot and due to lack of people in area at this time had a
general patrol covering P&rkside Road , Middlewood Road and entire park area.
Together with PC Moulding I liaised with Park patrol Officers who were cm static duty at
Hillsborough car park at the location previously mentioned. At this time there were very few
pedestrians and vehicles in the area. We maintained foot patrol in and around the Park up to
1.50pm noticing a general but not excessive build up of pedestrians in the area.
1350 stairted to make our way from the Park area towards the Football ground. We walked along
Parkside load onto Penistone Road at which time Penistone Road was full of supporters making
their way to the gotrad y many of these supporters having or appearing to have consumed
alcohol of differing levels. Quite a large number of these supporters carrying cans of beer
or lager with them. General attitude of the supporters at this time appeared to be quite
friendly. Having wofcked both inside and outside the ground for the last 16 years ( including
several Semi Final matches ) the general build up seemed to be as normal , and where the
supporters were carrying beer and lager it was anticipated this would be taken from then as
they attempted entry nearto the turnstiles at the ground.
1400 Entered gymnasium at rear of North stand at Ground for prepared hot meal.
 1440 Left gymnasium to resume duties as before with PC Moulding. Penistone Road heavily
congested with fans entering ground. Due to this we walked along Penistone Road North , turned
left onto Vere Road , left again into Leppings Lane where we intended to reach the park via
Catchbar Lane , Parkside Road*As we turned onto Leppings Lane I saw a heavy build up of fans
who were very noisy with continuous streams of fans still approaching the ground along
Leppings Lane both from the direction of Middlewood Road and Penistone Road North. Many of
these were rushing towards the ground in obvious attempts to enter as soon as possible.
From where I was walking I could see that the entire driveway leading to the entrances to the
ground from this side were totally packed with people. 1 could dee the Police       Rover
parked on the perimeter of the crowd and could plainly hear its Public address system in
operation and recognised the voice of PC Buxton appealing to spectators not to push as people
were being squashed at the front of the turnstiles. It was obvious that many of the supporters
were taking no notice and I could hear some jeering at the appeals. Many of the supporters
in this area seemed to be the worst for drink. I was unable to assist due to the sheer numbers
and the fact I was in Plain clothes. Upon looking around I could see numerous supporters on
Catchbar Lane who were on the roof of the Police section House and others who were climbing up
adjoining buildings and trees. I went with the intention of removing these for safety reasons iQ
whilst en route back to Hillsborough car park.
We managed to remove the fans from the buildings and shepherded them along Catchbar Lane
towards Penistone Road and away from the general direction of the ground. The time now would
have been approximately 2.50/2.55pm.
Upon reaching the Hillsborough car park area we again liaised with the Park Patrol Officers
who stated there section was only 3/4 full and everything there was all in order. We then moved
on through, the centre of the Park heading for the second car park situate within the park at
the Hawksley Avenue entrance.
    TDC 1181 DRASLING*                  TWO                                          ^   f

wkilst we were heading fir the second car park I heard numerous emergency vehicle sirens
and saw Police / Ambulance vehicles heading along Penistone Roadt towards the direction of the
ground. At this time I realised that something was obviously not right and together with PC
Moulding I ran through the park towards the ground via Parkside Road and Penistone Road North.
At this time there were still people approaching the ground along Penistone Road North although
not in great numbers. The large driveway within the clubs ground which runs at the rear of the
South stand was littered with fans who were approaching the Penistone Road North away from the
direction of Leppings Lane. I continued running along Penistone load North heading for the
Police Control room at the rear of the North stand and I entered the ground through the large
access gate which is situate between gate*0* and Vere load. I could see numerous emergency
vehicles scttered around the area and as I made my way into the ground X could hear people
screaming , crying and moaning. X was still making my way to the Gymnasium whan I was greeted
by people with make shift stretchers made of advertisement boards which wre carrying people
some alive , some obviously dead , other people were carrying persons by their arms and legs.
I went immediately into the Gymnasium and commenced to assist with the carrying of bodies and
laying them out on the gym floor checking for vital signs. Almost immediately Doctors were in
attendance volunteering their services and were administering first aid to some of the victims
and certifying others to be dead. As the bodies were being placed in the Gym , the Officers
assisting with the earrying of a particular body remained with that body. To try and form some
kind of order I assisted in making rows of the corpses as the numbers of dead bodies coming
into the Gym kept increasing. I am unable to recall any of the times from hereon due to the
sheer urgency of events, and full attention having to be paid to other matters.
When the flow of bodies had stooped coning into the Gym I was instructed to pair up wijh one
of the Uniform Officers standing by the bodies and assist him with the searching of and trying
to identify that particular body. This particular body that of a white male was unknown and
although carrying property had no means of identification. The Officer in this instance was PC
172 of *C* Division who at my request made a full log of the property , clothing and descriptio
of the body. The body then had the Officers details attached thereto t was placed in a body bag
and remained supervised by the uniform Officer. I then moved on and joined up with PC Booking
( F1 CID ) and remaining in the gym together we in turn numbered 12 bodies (37 to 48) having
liaised with the respective uniform Officers standing by the relevant body. When all of the
bodies had been numbered a form of reception area was set up within the gym where people
wishing to try and identify bodies would enter the area. Upon coning through the door they
were then met by a CID Officer who would ask them to view a photograph of the faces of the
dead bodies. These photographs were all numbered ( relevant to the body numbers)!! and were
pinned together on notice boards within the reception area. Having done this the relative
or friend would then furnish details to another CID Officer who would log all of the details
with the corresponding number for the selected photo referring to a particular body. The Photos
were then taken by hand to the area where the bodies were laid numbered awaiting viewing. The
body would then be trolleyed to the reception area t behind screens , accompanied by the
uniform Officer who had remained with the body throughout. Having viewed the body the relattive
or friend would then leave the reception area with the Uniform Officer and a CID ©fficer in
order to supply a statement. I remained throughout in the reception area dealing with
identification of photos and bodies.
The last person waiting to identify was seen at about 3*40am after which I was informed to
return to FI CID Office , where I went off duty at kam.
