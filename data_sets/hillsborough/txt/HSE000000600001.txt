1   INTRDDUCTIOT

    As part of the investigation undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive
    into the incident at Sheffield Wednesday PC's Hillsborough football ground
    on the 15th April 1989, I was asked by Dr C E Nicholson to investigate the
    audibility of the Public Address system (PA system) at Hillsborough. This
    report sets out the results of that investigation. Information on the
    design of the PA system and the equiment used in it was supplied by Mr R
    Annible (Contracts Director) of DP Sound Systems Ltd at a meeting on the
    8th June 1989 and in subsequent correspondence and telephone conversations.

    This report contains details of investigations performed both on site and in
    the laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other members of the
    Noise and Vibration Section of the Research and Laboratory Services Division
    (RLSD) working on irty instruction and under my general supervision.

2 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM

    I was informed by Mr Annible that the PA system at Hillsborough was designed
    and installed by DP Sound Systems Ltd of Sheffield. The principle
    components, loudspeakers and amplifiers, were made by TOA Electric Co Ltd, a
    Japanese company which is a specialist manufacturer of public address
    equipment of seme 55 years standing.

    Mr Annible informed me that the PA system was installed primarily as a means
    of communicating with the spectators for crowd control or in an emergency.
    The system is controlled from the police control booth located between the
    West and South Stands. In the booth is a control unit (TOA VR 1012) on
    which the microphone input to the system is located together with a button
    which activates the system when depressed. The control unit also has a
    series of buttons which enable sectors of the ground to be selected so that
    messages can be relayed to specific areas (see Figure 1). The PA system has
    been divided into eight sectors; inside and outside of each of the four
    stands (Figure 2). The outside sectors also include the passages leading to
    the upper seated accommodation in each of the stands. Any combination of
    the eight sectors can be selected or, using the button labelled 'ALL CALL'
    every sector can be selected. The sector outside the West stand also
    includes loudspeakers directed at the approach to the turnstiles at Leppings
    Lane. Thus it is possible for the police to talk to those inside the ground
    independently of those approaching it or vice versa. It is also, for
    example, possible to talk to those inside and/or approaching the West
    stand/terracing independently of those anywhere else in or around the
    ground.

    A second input to the PA system has been provided for use by a Disc Jockey
     (DJ) to play music and jingles to the spectators and to make announcements.
    This input uses part of the same PA system, that directed at all spectators
    inside the ground, ie the four sectors inside the stadium. The DJ's input,
    whether music or speech, is automatically overridden when the police control
    panel is used. Thus a message from the police can be relayed to one portion
    of the crowd whilst the rest hear the DJ. The DJ's booth is underneath the
    police control room.

    The location of the loudspeakers in the West stand, inside and outside
    sectors, are shown in Figure 3. These are controlled by buttons 1 and 7
    respectively. The 12 loudspeakers inside the stand are mounted under the
    front edge of the roof and are alternately directed into the upper stand and
    down to the terracing. These loudspeakers are TOA TZ 201 units. Outside

                                         1
  the stand TOA TC 15ML horn loudspeakers have been used. Using TOA data for
  the loudspeakers calculations were made of the sound pressure level (SFL) at
  various locations inside and outside the ground (see Table 1).

3 NOISE LEVELS IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS

  No useful information on typical noise levels in football grounds was found
  in the technical literature. Consequently limited measurements were made at
  the first available opportunity which happened to be the Liverpool vs
  Arsenal match at Liverpool FC's Anfield ground on the 26th of May 1989.
  Tape recordings were made of the sound level at the pitch side and on the
  collar of a member of RISD's Noise and Vibration      Sectionwho was a spectator
  in the 'Kop'. The sound pressure level was also       logged as 1 minute averages
  using noise dosemeters in both cases. The pitch side microphones were
  located approximately 1m from the goal line, 8m from the nearest goal post
  and 4m from the spectators at the 'Kcp' end of the ground. The equipment
  used is detailed in Annex 1.

  Plots of the 1 minute average sound pressure level (SPL) are presented in
  Figure 4. The match kicked off at about 20:15 and finished about 22:00.
  During this period the 1 minute average level in      the Kbpwas always greater
  than 90 dB(A) and above 100 dB(A) for much of the time. The corresponding
  figures at pitch side are about 5 dB lower, viz 85 dB(A) and 95 dB(A).

  Unpublished data from a football match at Bristol, and from the Rugby League
  Cup Final, at Wembley, were made available to HSE. These data were obtained
  as 3 minute averages and are presented in Figure 5 together with the HSE
  data re-calculated as 3 minute averages. Clearly the HSE Anfield data shows
  much higher levels than at Bristol and Wembley.

  The logarithmic units used to measure noise as a 1 or 3 minute average can
  mask much lower levels which may have occurred during the period. Thus it
  is possible for the sound level to be relatively lew for a significant
  proportion of the time whilst the average level is high. A statistical
  distribution analysis of the sound levels illustrates this effect. Table 2
  presents such data for the Anfield recordings for 3 minute periods leading
  up to and just beyond the start of the match. From these data it can be
  seen that althou^i the 3 minute average levels in the Kbp were between 97.9
  and 105.7 dB(A), the level was below 91.9 dB(A) for 10% of the total period
  (as shewn by Io0) 31x1 belew 96.9 dB(A) for 50% of the time (I5 Q) •
  Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the various statistical
  measurements of fluctuating sound for a 3 minute period of the Anfield
  recordings in the Kcp. In this period 108.2 dB(A) was exceeded for 1% of
  the time; 105.2 dB(A) for 10% and 97.2 dB(A) for 50%; whereas the average
  level (Leq) was 101.1 dB(A).

  In Figure 6 various crowd activities which give rise to high levels of sound
  are identified.

4 TESTS ON THE HILLSBOROUGH PA SYSTEM

  Recordings were made of speech relayed by the Hillsborough PA system at
  locations inside and outside the West stand and terracing. The locations
  are shewn in Figure 7 and described in detail in Annex 2. The recordings
  were made on the 7th June 1989 in an empty ground. The speech was input
  using either the microphone on the control panel in the police control room
  or the one in the DJ's booth and consisted of a reading of the team list
  from a match programme and other lists. Recordings were made for two

                                        2
    different voices, one male the other female.  The recordings were analysed
    for their sound pressure level and amplitude fluctuation. The A-weighted*
    SFL at each measurement location is given in Table 1 together with the
    calculated performance of the PA system. As would be expected the measured
    sound levels from the PA system vary depending on hew loudly the passage was
    spoken, or indeed individual words in the passage. However, it is clear
    that the system is capable of producing the theoretical levels calculated
    from manufacturer's data inside the ground (Sector 1). Outside the West
    stand (Sector 7) the levels measured are somewhat less than those
    calculated.

    (* The 'A' frequency weighting is applied to acoustic signals to simulate
    the frequency response of the ear.)

5   TNTETJiTGIBUJTY OF THE HILLSBOROUGH PA SYSTEM

    The 'Green Guide' (Ref 1) states, in Section 12:

    "There should be a canmunications system capable of clearly relaying
    essential messages to all parts of the ground in both normal circumstances
    and in an emergency."

    and in paragraph 194 iii:

    "Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast messages can
    be heard under reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons
    of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the public has access.
    The system should be capable of being controlled from a central point and
    should ideally be capable of addressing messages to each major section of
    the ground. The power supply to the system should be such as to enable it
    to operate in an emergency such as fire or failure of the mains supply."

    I understand from DP Sound Ltd that the Hillsborough PA system was designed
    to fulfil this requirement.

    Whether a message can be clearly understood will depend on many factors but
    it was not possible to identify from the literature any criteria by which
    the intelligibility of speech from public address systems could be assessed
    directly. There are standards for emergency evacuation signals and guidance
    for selecting warning signals but these do not address spoken warnings from
    PA systems. Standards for assessing the intelligibility of speech in rooms
    cannot be applied directly to sports stadia PA systems. Therefore it was
    not possible to assess the performance of the Hillsborough PA system against
    defined performance criteria in terms of intelligibility of messages relayed
    through it.

    Typically tests of speech intelligibility require panels of subjects to
    listen to standard word lists against appropriate background noises. Such
    tests were impracticable in this investigation. Instead an ad hoc
    assessment was made vising recordings of announcements made at Hillsborough
    and of crowd noise made at Anfield.

    In this ad hoc test twelve subjects (HSE staff of age range frcm 21 to 43
    years) were asked to judge if they could understand the recording from
    Hillsborough when replayed together with the recorded crowd noise from
    Anfield. It was not possible to reproduce the exact sound field present at
    Hillsborough at the time of the incident. Therefore the recordings were
    replayed in an anechoic chamber through a PA system which had been set to

                                         3
    produce a uniform diffuse sound field at the listening position (see
    Figure 8 ). The two recordings were superimposed at known relative levels
    and the listeners were asked if they could hear the PA announcements and if
    they could understand them. The test was repeated at four relative levels
    of the two signals. Table 3 lists the level of the announcement relative to
    the crcwd noise at which the listener could understand the announcement.
    Nearly all the listeners could understand the announcement when its average
    level (Leq) was 10 dB belcw that of the crowd noise.

6   DISCUSSION

    Mr Annible informed me that in designing the PA system the installers had
    made the following assumptions in respect of noise levels at football
    matches: ambient levels 77-80 dB(A); average levels 85 dB(A); short duration
    levels 90-95 dB(A). The data frcxn Bristol and Wembley would support these
    assumptions but the Anfield data would not. Obviously the noise level of
    spectators will depend on many factors such as: number of spectators; design
    of stadium; significance of the match; emotional state of the crcwd. Each
    of the crcwd noise measurements presented in this report were taken at
    important matches but with very different crcwd numbers and in different
    stadia. This accounts for the range of noise levels reported. It should be
    noted that the match at Anfield was the League Championship deciding match
    and Liverpool FC fans are noted for their vocal (choral) support for their
    team. The Anfield ground is very compact with roofing covering all
    spectator areas. All factors which would lead to a high crcwd noise level.

    In general a wide range of levels will occur depending on the factors
    mentioned above. During any one match or even any period of a match, levels
    will fluctuate and although the average may be high this will be influenced
    by short periods of very high levels, leaving significant periods at lower
    levels (as illustrated in Figure 6 ). Messages from a PA system can be
    understood from information received in these periods. The simple listening
    test described illustrates this since messages with average sound levels
    10 dB (A) belcw the ambient level could be understood. Thus, whilst it is
    impracticable to design sound systems to overcame the highest levels, a
    criteria based on exceeding a particular level which it is assumed crcwd
    noise will only exceed for short periods of time is perhaps more realistic
    (say I»0)• There is, of course, a difference in the ability to hear and
    understand a message and actually listening to it. Spectators deeply
    involved in watching the game may not listen to messages they can clearly
    hear. At Anfield, and at a recently televised International rugby match,
    spectator safety messages were preceded by a chime which identified them as
    such. This facility seems a sensible way to attract the spectators'
    attention.

    In the particular case of the situation at Hillsborough leading up to the
    incident I have no information of crcwi noise levels on the West terracing.
    Nor do I have such information for the areas inside and outside the
    turnstiles at Leppings Lane. Careful examination of a video tape, supplied
    by West Midlands Police, for the period 14:45 to 15:07 has not enabled noise
    levels at the West terracing to be determined since the 'effects' microphone
    is also picking up crcwi noise from other parts of the ground. Up to 14:50
    it is not possible to identify any chants clearly related to Liverpool
    fans. Additionally, when spectators are at their most vocal they usually
    wave their hands, scarves and banners in the air en masse. There is no sign
    of this activity on this section of the video tape. Throughout this period
    music is being played on the PA system and can be heard clearly above the
    crcwd noise. At about 14:50 the teams were announced over the PA system.

                                        4
    Fran then    chi   there were the usual chanting of the fans as their
    members' names were called and as the teams entered the pitch at 14:54 and
    the match started. Between the announcements of the teams and the kick-off,
    music was being played and can be heard except during the loudest chants
    frcm the crcwd.

    The pattern of crcwi chanting seems much the same as that observed at
    Anfield though visual indications from the video tape suggest that a
    significant percentage of the Liverpool fans were not joining in the
    chanting. Thus given the open nature of the West terracing and the numbers
    of fans there it is reasonable to conclude that crcwd noise levels at the
    West terracing would not have been as high as those found at Anfield. In my
    cpinion it is probable therefore that any messages relayed through the PA
    system would have been intelligible to the spectators. It should be noted
    that although the Hillsborough system is capable of having a chime, one was
    not fitted at the time of the incident. I understand from Mr I A Ramsay,
    Managing Director of DP Sounds Ltd that a chime has now been fitted
    following the publication of the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor.

7 CONCLUSIONS

    From this limited investigation I have made the following conclusions:

    7.1   The Hillsborough PA system had been professionally installed using good
          quality components and meets the performance criteria to which it was
          designed.

    7.2   It is probable that spectators in the West terracing and its approaches
          could have heard any messages relayed through the PA system during the
          period encompassing the incident.

    7.3   There is limited information on crcwd noise in sports stadia and the
          necessary performance requirements for PA systems to ensure
          intelligible communication.
