    LONDON SW19                                Date 7 July 1989




    Lord Justice Taylor was most grate£ul to you £or giving him your
    time yesterday, especially at such a busy time for you, to
    explain some of the arrangements at Wimbledon for crowd control
    and safety.   He found his visit most helpful, and would be
    grateful if you would pass on his thanks to Major Tetlow for
    conducting round the ground.

    As you will have realised, Lord Justice Taylor is particularly
    interested in the arrangements made to accommodate standing
    spectators. During the course of his visit he discussed with
    Major Tetlow how large the standing area available is, on both
    sides of the centre court. He wondered if it would be possible
    for him to have a note of the detailed area involved, if this
    could be measured in square metres at a convenient moment after
    the Championships. If you were able to let him have a simple
    plan of the terraced area, with an indication of the lay out of
    crush barriers, that would be even more helpful. Similar
    information for court No. 1 would be helpful.

    I hope very much that you will be able to assist Lord Justice
    Taylor in this way. If you are not entirely clear as to what is
    wanted, please get in touch with me and I will be happy to
    elaborate further.

                                            Yours sincerely




                                       Secretary to the Inquiry
