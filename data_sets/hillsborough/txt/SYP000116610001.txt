               On Saturday 15 April         1989 I came on duty at W o m b w e 11 Police Station
e/s.
               at 9 a m , to be transported to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium

               at Hillsborough for the match between Liverpool and Nottingham

               Forest.     At 9 . 50am I paraded with other members of my serial                  in the

               North Stand of the Hillsborough Stadium.                   I was with serial      15,

               responsible to Sergeant 1757 Burns.                At 10.15am we ate our packed

               meals then I was given a more detailed briefing with serial                       15 and

               serial    14 on the terraces of the West Stand at the Leppings Lane e n d ,

               by Inspector White.          My s e r i a l , serial    15, was deployed to turnstiles

               9 to 16 behind the West Stand inside the ground to search incoming

               fans for prohibited a r t i c l e s .

               Once the match began we were to be deployed in the North tunnel to

               observe public o r d e r .     I was not deviated to any other            loc a ti on .

               At 11am I began my duties inside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane

               end.     The tur ns tiles    opened to the public at 11 o'olook although very
               few people came through at this t i m e .               Gradually,   the Liverpool fans

               began to trickle t h r o u g h , mostly fami 1 ies at this t i m e .        The

atmosphere was good natured and friendly.              I was engaged in searching

the incoming fans as they came through the turnstiles and directing

them to their places.          At 1.10pm I confiscated a Swiss pen knife from

a male fan which was put in the property store to be collected by the

gentleman after the m a t c h .     At this time there was s t i 11 only a slow

trickle of supporters entering the g r o u n d .

At 2.20pm I remember noting the time and commenting to a colleague

that it did not seem very busy and that it seemed that many fans

were "cutting it a bit fi ne ” to get into the ground for the kick-                   ;

off.     Very shortly after t h i s , large numbers of Liverpool fans began

to congregate outside the tur ns ti l es , pushing and shoving to get                 ;

through the turnstiles.          Most of the fans I searched at this time

smelled of a l c o h o l .   Through the turnstiles I could see people

pushing and shoving and being crushed up against the turnstiles.

People coming through were pale f a c e d , sweating and complaining about

the crush o u t s i d e .    I could hear people banging on the concertina

gate next to the turnstiles             (Gate B) to be let in.   Several   fans

climbed up the wall above the turnstiles and refused to get back down

when we shouted at them,         saying they were being crushed against the

wall o u t s i d e .   A few fans clambered through the turnstiles without            -

ti c k e t s , these were apprehended and ejected from the ground.

As kick-off approached the mood of the crowd w o r s e n e d , there was an

air of apprehension inside the turnstiles as those outside became

more desperate to get in the g r o u n d .        It became obvious that the

situation outside was becoming c h a o t i c .       I spoke to a Policewoman who

came through the t ur n s t i l e s .    She said she had been outside the

turnstiles and had been pinned against the wall by the crush of

people and that she had been f ri g h t e n e d .     More and more fans were        j

clambering up on top of the wall above the turnstiles n o w ,                        j

complaining of the situation outside and trying to jump down inside

                                                                                        i
As they jumped off the turnstile roof they brought down the

guttering.          One such fan almost landed on top of m e .    I helped him to

his feet and asked to see his ticket,           he said he had given it in at

the turnstile.          I told him that if he could not produce his ticket he

would be ejected from the g r o u n d .      At this he became very abusive and

started to struggle v i o l e n t l y .   PC 78 Booth came to my assistance and

he and PC 253 Burke marched the fan away to be e j e c t e d .        I then

resumed my duties at the tur ns ti l es .

By now it was impossible to search e v e r y o n e , as they came over the

wall or through the tu rn sti le s, they were charging into the West

S t a n d , shoving past anyone in their w a y .    S u dd en ly , I became aware of

a surge of fans and saw that the concertina gate            (Gate B } had been

opened.      I had to jump to the side to avoid being knocked over as

fans ran into the g r o u n d .    I would estimate that approximately three

hundred people came through the gate and then it was c l o s e d .         When

the area inside the turnstiles had cleared of people I made my way to

the tunnel      in the centre of the West S t a n d , noticing a number of

e m p t y , crushed beer cans which must have been kicked through the

t u r ns ti le s.   A few fans were coming out of this tunnel and shouting

abuse at me,         saying that they were being crushed in the pens and that

I should do something about it.           One man came up to me in a

distressed state and said that there were some children at the front

of the pen being squashed.             I spoke to PC 3023 Martin and together we

made our way down the t u n n e l .        I did not note the time but it was

only a few minutes after the gate had been o p e n e d .          When we got to

the end of the t u n n e l , which was empty at this stage except for a

couple of fans making their way o u t , I saw that the pens on either
                                                                                       j


side of the central dividing fence were               packed.   Fans were climbing     '

up on to this fence and being hauled up               into the seating area above.     '

Other people were pushing each other up               to be caught by people

leaning down from the s e a t s .        I shouted    at the fans on the fence to      i
                                                                                       i

themselves and partly because I feared the overhanging seating area                    j

might collapse.           I tried to push my way into the left hand pen         (Pen   j

4) by pushing fans back underneath the retaining barriers and up

into the t u n n e l .     As I shoved further down the pen I saw that several

fans had spilled on to the pitch and that there were Policemen

standing on the fence at the front of the pen signalling to me to get                  I

people out to the r e a r .                                                            S

At this stage I realised the seriousness of                the situation and began     |

shoving the fans under the barriers and shouting at them to get o u t .                j

It was almost          impossible for me to make myself heard above the noise of]

get nearer the front of the pen the crowd was hysterical,                 screaming    j

abuse at me as I tried to get them under the barriers,                some because

they d i d n ’t want      to move and others because I think they were

f r i g h te ne d.    I could hear someone screaming " S h e ’s fucking d e a d , do

s om eth in g” over and over again and when I made my way to him I saw a

heap of about six male bodies with a female body on the t o p .               This

pile of bodies was being trampled on by other f a n s .             The woman on top
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R22

had obviously been dead for some time,         her face was purple and her

lips and eyes were black.        I c o u l d n ’t get down to them for the crush

of people around me who were trying to get out and I had got

separated from PC Martin.        Eventually I managed to organise the fans

to carry out these bodies and helped carry the last man from the pile

out myself.    By now there were more Police in the tunnel as it became

obvious that a disastrous situation was occurring.           We had to step

over many bodies which had been put down in the tunnel u n t i 1 we got

to a clear space in the enclosed a r e a , immediately behind the West

Stand.    I made sure that the unconscious man I had helped carry out

was breathing,    put him in the recovery position and left him in the

care of another fan while I went to help with the many bodies which

were now laid out in the area behind the West S t a n d .

It is my opinion that from the sheer number of injured and dead

people and the condition of some of the b o d i e s , the crushing must

have started Some time before the gate was o p e n e d .

Next I helped a col league who was trying to revive a dead m a n , I gave

mouth to mouth resuscitation whilst she worked on his c h e s t .        The man

smelled strongly of a l c o h o l .   A1though we worked for a long time we

were unable to revive h i m .     I covered his face with something and

moved on to help someone e l s e .      I saw a man laying on the ground

who's face was blue                                                        he

was dead so I removed his outer coat and covered his f a c e .         There

were fans wandering amongst       the dead and injured b o d i e s , frantically

searching for friends or relatives who were m i s s i n g .     Most of the

fans were in an extreme state of shock.          I tried to comfort and

reassure several of these people but there was little I could do for

them,   one man clung to me and cried hysterically.         I had to sit him

facing a wall so he c o u l d n ’t see the dead bodies    lying all around,

It seemed to be quite a while before the ambulances a r r i v e d , during
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     R22

         this time I administered first aid to several people as best I

         could.   When the ambulances arrived I tried to organise those who I

         knew were seriously injured to have priority in the ambulances.                The

         ambulances queued up in the lane behind the walled area behind the

         West Stand.     Dead bodies were laid along one side of the lane,

         injured bodies along the other side.            When all the dead bodies had

         been removed from the area behind the West Stand an announcement was

         broadcast,    asking the fans to leave.         I stood with a line of other

         Policemen in front of the gate leading out to where the dead and

         injured people were lying to prevent them from using this gate.                As

         the fans made their way out from the seating area of the West Stand

         many of them were abusive to the Pol i c e , saying such things as ’’This

         is all your fa u l t ” and "Murdering B a s t a r d s ."   When all these people,

         had made their way out I went back into the pens to clear the

         remaining fans from t h e r e .    There were several people looking for

         missing friends and rel a ti ve s, 1 advised these people to go to the

         Pol ice room by the North Stand although at this time I wasn't aware

         that any arrangements had been made to deal with these people.

         Eventually I was reunited with other members of serial              15 and we made

         our way to the North Stand where we were told that 96 people had

         died.    When we were stood down from the North Stand I returned to

         W o m b w e l 1 Police Station and went off duty at 7.30pm.
