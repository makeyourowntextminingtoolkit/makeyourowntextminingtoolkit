DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL POLICY IN THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL




1-        At a meeting of the ACPO                            General      Purposes          Committee         on    1st

June,   1979,          it     was       resolved        to    form     a   Standing Working               Group       to

assess the problems relating to football hooliganism.                                              The Group was

constituted            to     include       representatives                from    other       organisations,

members      of    ACPO       and       anyone        within    the    Police      Service         with    special

expertise         or    knowledge          in    this        matter.       Its purpose was              to examine

issues of national importance.




2.        During             the    life        of     the    Working       Group       it    considered             the

generality         of        policing           football         and       formulated         some       Notes        of

Guidance on policing which related particularly to                                           arrangements            for

travelling         supporters,             their       arrival        and departure           at     grounds         and

information about                  their   movement           through      the    transit          system.          This

guidance was eventually formulated and made available to officers in

a document called                  "The    Public       Order       Guide".       The    Group       met     on      six

occasions         before       it was       allowed           to lapse.        There still remained an

arrangement            for    meetings          to     be     held     on an      ad    hoc    basis       between

interested         parties         and Mr.       Anderton,          the Chief Constable of Greater

Manchester,        was        appointed          to    act     as    Liaison       Officer         and    to    be     a

depository         for       information              about     special        events        and    a    reference

point on difficulties that might arise.                                    The Working Group also set

up a system whereby each Police Force hosting a football ground was

asked   to    nominate              a   Liaison        Officer         to pass         information         to       his

counterpart            in other         Police        Forces     about travelling              supporters.             A
National Register of Liaison Officers was                                     and       is maintained           at    New

Scotland Yard            and    this       system has remained in tact ever                                 since.     It

has    in        recent        times       been         reorganised                and        its      arrangements

formalised, paragraphs 25 - 28 refer.




3.          At    a meeting           of   the        General          Purposes         Committee       on    the     3rd

November,         1983,    in     the       face        of        continued            problems        at     football

grounds     and     indeed       at    other          sporting          events,         the    whole    matter        was

discussed         again    and        it    was        decided          to    resuscitate           the       football

hooliganism        group        but    extend          its        terms      of        reference       so    that     all

matters concerned with hooliganism in sport could be considered.                                                       To

this end the General Purposes Committee approved the constitution of

a Standing         Sub-Committee            on    "Hooliganism                in       Sport".      Mr.       Anderton

has   since       that    time    acted       as       Chairman.             The       Terms     of Reference of

the Sub-Committee included a requirement to act as a reference point

in respect of special problems                          relating to sporting fixtures, mainly

in England and Wales but also with an eye to Scotland and to events

in    Europe.        The        early       business               of     the      Sub-Committee              included

consideration of the initial C.C.T.V.                                   systems        set up in England and

Scotland      and        consideration             of    problems             in        relation       to    alcohol,

particularly on public service vehicles.




4.          The     reconvened             Sub-Committee                on      Hooliganism         at       Sporting

Events met for the first time on the 13th November,                                              1984 and it has

met on a total of twelve occasions                                since.          Early on       its    agenda was

the   question       of    guidance         offered           to police            officers.           It was        felt

this needed to be reviewed                       in    the        light      of    then       recent    events        and

the    Secretary          was     asked           to     undertake                an     examination          of      the

guidance.          The    new     document              was        prepared            and    approved        by      the




                                                              -   2-
Sub-Committee            on     the     23rd    February,          1987    when     it   was        decided      to

issue it as a stand-alone document which should be made                                        available to

all   officers          with     a responsibility             for     supervising        football games.

The document            subsequently           received       the    endorsement         of    ACPO       Council

and    by     October          1987     had     been    circulated          to    all        Police       Forces.

THE HOOLIGANISM PROBLEM




5.           To    compass       a     topic     of    this        complexity       completely            and    in

detail      is clearly not possible within the terms of this                                       submission.

Nonetheless a number of points need to be made which relate both to

current strategies and to ways forward.




6.           First of all it has                to be said that football hooliganism is

almost a worldwide phenomenon                         and has plagued the                    game    in England at

least since the mid-sixties.                           It is difficult to                    guage the extent as

no    real    index       of     the    problem       exists        (arrests     are     a    very    doubtful

indicator).             Nonetheless       the police view is that by the mid to late

seventies it was endemic with police officers                                  subjected to spitting,

abuse       and    assault       so    often that it became                 "normal".         Indeed by the

turn of the             decade       police     officers       were    surprised         if    they       did    not

have to skirmish to preserve                      some kind of control                       over events.




7.           More        organised        and forceful             policing       checked           the    worst

excesses          and    in due        course    legislation          and     technology have              all    in

their       turn    added       to     the plethora of controls which in recent years

have restrained football's belligerents.                                  Despite    these         improvements

policemen          are     in    no     doubt     that        at    many    matches          the    balance       of




                                                          -   3-
control       is    a    fine     one    and     at     the           margins    hooligan         gangs        still

venture       on    a        deliberate       course            of     affray.       The      nagging      strain

associated         with       this     violent        fringe           does     much    to     colour      police

perceptions of crowd control.




8.        It is probably fair to say that traditional policing methods

for handling football were                    largely consistent with                      policing      methods

for    handling          large       crowds      in     general.              During       the     1960's,        as

problems      with       football       crowds        became           notorious,       policing         methods

became     increasingly              defensive        and       a     good    deal     more      co-ordination

between Police Forces developed.                        Over the last two decades policing

football      has       become    a specialist              area       and policing strategies have

been based upon a presumption that violence between rival spectators

is probable wherever they have the opportunity to intermingle.




9.        Analysing           policing     tactics,             certainly over the earlier part

of    these   years,         allows     the    contention              that     substantially           what    has

been     developed           is   an    all    encompassing                  pattern     of      "policing       by

containment".            There are three fundamental aspects to this approach:-




(a)       The development of information concerning                                    crowds      in    transit

           and plans to intervene and escort at every turn;




(b)       A    commitment         to segregation of "home"                       and "away"        supporters

           both         in   transit,     through               the    turn-stiles,           whilst      in    the

           ground and at their departure;




(c)       The      construction          of    containment               fencing       within     grounds        to

           control the movement of supporters.




                                                            -   4-
10.        The       general          strategy       of    "policing             by   containment"              is    near

universal            and    routine to police, ordinary                         supporters          and hooligans

alike.      In       the    great       majority          of cases             it operates          with     relative

ease     and,    perhaps             paradoxically,            allows           decent    spectators            to     feel

secure     within           their       own        controlled             environment.               It    has        been

successful        over          the    years       for    most           fixtures       in marshalling                great

numbers of football                   spectators          within         grounds      more      or    less       trouble

free, despite undertones of aggression at the fringes.




11.        On the negative side its disadvantages are that, it tends to

encourage an          antagonistic             and             tribalist attitude                   between           rival

groups     and       to    some       degree provides               a framework for the                   "war games"

of determined hooligan gangs.                            Equally,         whilst we may have                contained

the    problem,            in    reality       we    require             a veritable          army of       policemen

every weekend to hold sway between hostile groups                                          apparently bent on

violence.            The    sheer       size    of       the police commitment is daunting and

has progressively raised the question of how the problem of violence

might     be     removed          rather      than merely                controlled.           (This observation

has to be set aside the general case that any large crowd needs                                                        some

measure         of        direction          and     control              in    the      interests         of        public

 safety).             Hence       over the      last       four      years, at          least       at    the        policy

 level,     we       have       been    doing        much      more        to     study       the    phenomenon            of

hooliganism and                 to    try    complementary                strategies       designed         to       reduce

 the problem itself.




 12,           This        more       searching          examination             of     hooliganism             has     been

 based in part upon close                      observation                and    in part       upon       the    work      of

 intelligence              operations         which       have       done        much    to     reveal       the       inner

 workings        of       hooligan          gangs.        In    the        event      this     work       has        put   in




                                                                -   5-
question a number of basic propositions.                                    Policing by containment in

a sense       has    been policing             "en-masse".             Faced        with      crowds       of     many

thousands       it    has     seemed          impossible          to    concentrate            on     individual

offenders and police officers have planned to exercise crowd control

over    large       groups    at       "arms    length".          This       tends       to   have        sustained

the    presumption           that      football        crowds          by     their        very      nature           are

volatile       and combustible and that whenever rival groups clash sparks

of violence are inevitable.                     The more we have become                       involved in the

close analysis of hooliganism the more this presumption has been put

in question.




13.           The alternative thesis of football hooliganism has much more

to    do with       concentrating            police     attention            upon       determined criminal

hooligans.          Very     often it seems these people have no other interest

than    violence,           they       are     organised          in        gangs       and    carry        through

pre-determined plans to fight and cause damage wherever they can do

so with        impunity.          Ta    reality    few clashes               are    in fact spontaneous,

they are almost always arranged even if that is not                                           evident        at       the

time.     The numbers          involved vary from 1 0 's to 100's.                                 They are part

of a culture          with    a hierarchy          of    command,             a mythology           of     motives,

and     the    outline       of     national      organisation.                 Football           provides           for

them a magnificent opportunity - the                              nature       of       the   game     is       one    of

physical        confrontation;            support       is    often partisan                  in    the     extreme;

ill     constructed          stadia          provide     an       accommodating               platform;           vast

crowds     provide         both     the      atmosphere       and the cover behind which they

can manoeuvre;          and the fixture list                  organises             a    calendar         for    their

criminal encounters.

14.        It    would        be    wrong     to     describe             these       hooligan          groups          as    a

"tiny minority"          as the          football     industry is want to do.                             Regardless

they are a minority and some explanation of how they can create such

a destructive          level of nuisance              is required.                 Equally          it has          to be

explained why          some        fixtures,       indeed           the    majority of fixtures,                        pass

off   without     any     apparent          trouble.                Football       crowds          can       be    broken

down into at least three broad groups.                                    Firstly, there are those who

are keen supporters,                who    attend     regularly,                who    will       be     represented

within    a wide        age    range and who are in every respect co-operative,

and behave       fairly and reasonably.                        Many of these               people        will       be       in

seated     areas,       family          paddocks      and           be     season       ticket          holders.              A

second broad group who fill the popular terraces will be vociferous

in    their     support       of     their     own    club,              acquiescent            towards           the    ill

behaved and indifferent to                   police            strategies.             A    third       broad       group

of    largely     young male             volatile     supporters                will       be    noisy,       actively

involved      in demonstrating               allegiance              to    their      own       club     as       well       as

belligerence       towards          the    opposition.               Whilst generally passive they

are sufficiently          ill-humoured             that         if       the   opportunity             for    disorder

is    presented        they    will       join     the         throng.          The    determined             hooligan

groups    who     represent          a    special        stratum           of     this       last       element          can

therefore,       and    this       is     really     the       point,          rely    upon a good deal of

tacit support in the event of disorder.




15.        The      hooligan              groups      are            constantly                 surveilling              the

environment         for        opportunities                   to        generate           confrontation                    in

situations       that will          carry    the     uncommitted                with       them.        In    addition

our   present      understanding             leads       to         the    view       that       they    pick       their

fixtures and that the hooligan effort is selectively targetted.




                                                           -   7-
16.           On this alternate thesis it is not surprising that "policing

by     containment"           has        not    found an answer to the problem even though

it has generally held it in check.                                  The hooligan may be arrested on

occasions          but    the       determined          nature          of    his activities               is likely to

remain undiscovered.                      For     these       reasons we have                   been       concentrating

in     recent        times          much       more     on    the        development              of       surveillance,

intelligence and evidence gathering.                                    This    is a developing phase and

might        be    termed       "pre-emptive             policing".                 Many     of      the     initiatives

described later in this evidence are designed to sharpen and target

the police approach to this aspect of the problem.




17 •          A    further      matter          needs     to be examined here and that is the

connection between public safety and hooliganism.                                                 These      issues       are

often        seemingly        at     variance.            Containment                fencing         for    example       may

also         prevent          rapid            evacuation.               Equally           however,              lack      of

containment,          will      allow hooligan                groups           to storm the opposition and

create        a    scenario         within        which       there           are wild          surges,          panic    and

massively           dangerous            crowd        pressures.               In    short        public         order     is

intrinsically linked with safety.                              Those charged with handling large

crowds        know    that      the        greatest       danger             lies    in    the       sheer       weight    of

numbers and that any signs of undue urgency or even panic can create

shock waves          in one part of the crowd felt with tremendous intensity

at     another.          This       is    clearly       likely          to     be    compounded             on    terraces

where        there       is     a    deliberate              incline.               Public        disorder         is     the

occurrence most               likely       to     generate          frantic          crowd movement.                Herein

lies     an       awesome     truth.            Where     large crowds are concerned the sheer

irrational momentum of sudden movement                                       can never          be     wholly      guarded

against.           Every step can be taken to provide a safe environment but

if     the    facilities            are        misused       there       can        be     no     guarantees.             Put

another way any large crowd in a confined space generates potential

dangers,      so long as that crowd is reasonably orderly that danger                                                        is

minimal       but       there     can be       no absolute protection,                          by engineering or

policing,          if    large       numbers       in    the       crowd        are       determined              to     behave

irresponsibly.




18.          Fortunately             the      great           majority              of     regular             supporters

recognise          the    obvious          dangers      and        are        cautious,         particularly               when

entering       and       leaving        sports       stadia.              The       hooligan         is      as    ever     the

bizarre exception and                   in this         category we                 would     have        to      put     those

who    seek        to    enter        an    all     ticket          stadium          without           tickets.           This

unfortunately             is     not       uncommon           and        as     a     strategy            must         involve

something of a mass attempt to stand any chance of success.




19.          These       paragraphs           are       an    attempt           to       characterise              football

hooliganism at its present stage, however the situation is almost by

its    very        nature        ever       changing.              Overall           there      is      probably           less

hooliganism by volume but where                              it occurs          it is often more                   serious.

Two     aspects          of     control       have       done           much    to       change        the        nature     of

hooliganism.             The legislation which prevented the general                                              supply     of

alcohol       to     fans       in    transit        and      the        universality             of    C.C.T.V.          have

made     a    major           impact.       Taken        together              the       effect        has        been     that

displays       of       wild     aggression         from hoardes                of drunken supporters                       are

much    less        frequent.           The    hooligan             has       moved       out     of      the      camera's

range    and        in    a word,          there     has      been        "displacement"                away       from     the

terraces      to the           darker       confines         of     the       stadium        or    to     other         venues

such as public houses and the transit system.




                                                               -   9-
20.          The    evidence        from    our    intelligence                operations            indicates         a

good    deal       of    violence      occurs     away       from       football            grounds       on    other

than    match       days    and     seemingly      having           nothing         to      do     with    football

other than that allegiance to a football team                                     is     the       reason behind

the    gang's      association.          This may be a consequential development or

it may simply be that we are only just learning of how these                                                   things

occur.        A    further       inference      drawn        from       intelligence               operations         is

that the hooligans               are much more          selective            in     their         affairs.       They

do not attend every match with a plan for disorder,                                          rather they pick

particular         fixtures       which     represent              in   their        distorted            mythology

special      challenge or consequence.                      On these occasions                     they may well

contact       beforehand         others     who    are       similarly            minded          and     even       the

opposition.




21.          Whilst much of the worst of the problem relates                                         to hooligan

gangs       this    is    not    the    only    phenomenon.                  Earlier         in    paragraph          14

reference was made to a "third estate" of supporters who were always

capable of wholesale misbehaviour                      if circumstances                  are favourable to

that    end.       Containment          policing       is    designed          to      keep       this    in    check

and    is    usually       effective       in doing         so.         It    should        be     said    however

that policing            "big    occasions"       is    especially             trying because that is

exactly when the atmosphere                    is likely to be so heightened that this

volatile       section      of    the    crowd will          misbehave.                It    is    the sense of

occasion associated with "semi-finals"                              and      "finals"         or    with       end    of

season        clashes        which        determine           championships,                     promotion           and

relegations which induces an atmosphere of challenge                                          and expectation

and    often drunkenness to boot.                   In these circumstances policing can

be    much     more      difficult       but    usually            achieveable           all       other       things




                                                        -   10 -
being equal.              It takes,          however,      very little to change the balance.

A violent incident occurring,                         a late train,                  inadequate             turn-stiles,

supporters       in numbers             without          tickets            - all these things can upset

the best of plans and given the numbers                                      involved reduce policing to

a desparate effort to maintain order.




22.        It       is    recognised           that      safety           is    the       main    concern           of    this

enquiry       and        the       attention       given        to        the       hooliganism              problem           is

purposefully presented in this context.                                        Skirmishes in public houses

away     from the ground will not of themselves put large numbers                                                         in    a

football      crowd           at    risk.But disorder             in and amongst                        a large crowd

is unquestionably                  dangerous.         If    crowds           are     orderly           and    responsive

the    only real danger,                providing spectator                     limits        are maintained,                  is

from     fire.           If    they    are     not,        then        no       matter        what the            policing

arrangements             and       given     the    outdated            nature        of      most          major    sports

stadia, there is a potential for danger if not disaster.

23.        As       previously              mentioned       the             original          ACPO          guidance           on

policing      football              included       the     setting             up   of     a national             index        of

football      liaison              officers.        Their       purpose             was     and        is    to     develop

"match     information"                to     assist       both           the       match      commander             in    his

planning      and        to    provide       information             to      his     opposite          number        in    the

event    of     an       away game.           This       index         is    maintained           at New          Scotland

Yard    and published                annually.           Throughout             the       1 9 7 0 's    this        was    the




                                                            -   11 -
basis of the intelligence                             system.              It was effective to a degree and

provided              information              about       numbers            of        travelling            supporters                  and

their        mode       of        transport.               It    was        consistent with                   the     strategy             of

"containment policing" in that it provided the basis                                                          for control                 and

segregation, escorts and the rest.




24.              In    1985        the    sub-committee                    determined             to    examine           and revise

this     intelligence                   system       recognising                  that       it    lacked         precision            and

formality.               As    a       result        of    that       examination                 the    system           of    passing

information between liaison officers was                                                standardised and                   an    effort

made        to        make        the     information                 available              more        comprehensive.                    A

proforma           was       produced           so    that           information              would        be       stored           on     a

common           basis        and        the     system              required            that       a    match        information

summary          be    prepared           at    the        conclusion of                  each         game     to    record           the

details           of the       match,          viz.,            number            of     travelling supporters,                        the

accuracy of the information supplied,details of coaches and trains,

details           of arrests,            details                of    any incidents                 etc.      A     copy        of    the

report       would           be     retained          by        the        Force         hosting         the        match        and       a

further           copy         sent       to         the        Force         from           whom       the       away          support

originated.              On this basis over time each liaison officer would have

a    file     of       reference          for        all encounters during preceding seasons as

well    as       a     file       on     the    performance                 of     his       supporters              at    all       away

games.            This         system          works effectively                       and    match           commanders              and

liaison officers report it is much more effective than it used to be.




25.           Whilst these arrangements were being put into effect we were

at     the       same         time       examining          more           closely           the       distinction              between

"match information" and "intelligence".                                                Whilst match information is

in     some          degree         intelligence,                in        real         terms          intelligence              should




                                                                       -   12 -
relate to the identity, the known associations,                                                  the known strategies

and,     if       possible,            the     actual          plans        of    those          involved          in     football

violence.              Recognising             that       most        liaison          officers       were           not       in    a

position          to    develop         much        of    this        sort       of    information we have over

the last          two       years       made      additional           recommendations.                       In particular

we     have        recommended               that        for     each        club           there     is        an        approved

"intelligence                officer"        who        should        seek       to        develop        a    portfolio            of

intelligence                in     real        terms.            It     is        recognised,                 however,          that

developing             intelligence               involves       a     different             approach           to        policing

football          than       simply managing                each       game.           It is entirely dependent

upon the progressive development of new skills                                                   through        observation,

surveillance,                undercover             operations,              targetted              use        of       C.C.T.V.,

intelligence             gathering,            active          policies           of       arrest     and           the    use      of

travelling             away        "spotters".              Whilst           such           an     approach             has     been

recommended             by       the    ACPO        Sub-Committee                the       costs     and        professional

difficulties have to be taken into account and many Forces have not

felt     at       this        stage       that          justification                 has        existed        for        such      a

commitment.              Equally          the        development             of        the       skills        necessary            to

build up intelligence takes time and,                                       whilst we              have       been        involved

in    explanation                and    training,          practices              are       not     yet       in     step       with

theory.




National Football Intelligence Unit




26.           In       an        effort        to        give     some           coherence           to         intelligence

gathering          and because               by     its    very nature                intelligence of this kind

needs     a       wide       purview,             the     ACPO        have       presented           the        case          for    a

nationally             organised             intelligence              unit.            Hooligan              gangs        operate

across        a    wide          area     and       may     of        course          be     involved           in        criminal




                                                                  -   13-
escapades       in any town between their point of departure and the venue

of the fixture.            Furthermore,       in recent times there is good evidence

that     they       will     often     plan     criminal          violence        which has          nothing

whatever       to    do with       football.        There        is    a   need    to    overview       such

events    to    identify patterns             and    recognise         what   is behind seemingly

unconnected events.




27.        Equally we         have    argued        that    as    there     has    been       much   public

concern about the conduct of English spectators abroad, particularly

those    following the national side,                     there is a need for             some central

point    to retain,          gather and disseminate intelligence concerning fans

who    travel       abroad    and   cause trouble.               At   present      no     local      Police

Force has any real stake in this matter.




28.        For all these reasons the development of a National Football

Intelligence Unit is seen as of                     critical          importance        and    at present

negotiations         with    the     Home    Office        are    well     in hand       for    it    to    be

funded by Common Police Services (Appendix B refers).




Closed Circuit Television




29.        In 1983 in conjunction with the Football Trust,                                who provided

the    finance,      an experiment was undertaken to examine the usefulness

of C.C.T.V.         in dealing with           hooliganism.             Rudimentary        systems      were

set up in Manchester,               Edinburgh and Birmingham.                 One of the problems

which always         exists    in developing              ACPO    (i.e.     national)         initiatives

is the lack of a central staff to evaluate and formulate policy.                                            It

was    therefore      difficult       to    evaluate        properly       these    experiments            but

in 1985 an approach was made to the Trust to extend these facilities




                                                      -   14-
in First and Second Division grounds.                                  About this       time      as    a   result

of    the    problems       at    Luton,       Birmingham,             Bradford and Heysel              the call

for C.C.T.V.         became a clamour.                 Very           obligingly      the    Football        Trust

made    considerable            funds       available           and    over the last few years                   some

sort of system has been made available to all League clubs.




30.          Because of the considerable expenditure there was                                         an   urgent

need    to    be     more       precise       in    the whole           area    of   C.C.T.V.           A   review

organised by the sub-committee reported that systems                                         were      generally

inadequate          as    far    as    their       specifications             went    and    that      operators

were untrained and operations                        lacked strategy.                In short,         simply      to

put    in    C.C.T.V.       was       no    answer    at        all.     We    needed    to    know what we

expected of the equipment, what the best configuration of                                              equipment

might       be,    operators          needed       to be        properly       trained      (to    this      end    a

whole new area of expertise had to                              be     developed)      and     it had        to    be

allied      to    an intelligence system.                       Protracted negotiations with the

Home Office took place and eventually a technical committee was                                                   set

up staffed by officers and support staff with knowledge in this area

from    various          Forces       and    with     the       permanent       expert       advice         of    Mr.

Andrew      Ford,        seconded from the Scientific,                        Research and Development

Branch of the Home Office.                     This committee has worked in conjunction

with the Football Trust and given professional                                    advice to all Police

Forces providing C.C.T.V. coverage.                              It has also developed advice on

new equipment and proper specifications.




31.          Over    the    last       two    years     training courses set up in Greater

Manchester have trained almost 200 operators nationally and training

is    ongoing.           Additionally         a    training           and   awareness       video      has       been

put together and made available to all Police Forces.




                                                            -   15-
32.         Whilst we have made great strides                                  in     this    area    the    present

lack    of       wholehearted            development               on    the    intelligence          front       still

means       that      the    real       potential         is       not    entirely         fulfilled.        Equally

there       remains         something         of a debate as to the best use of C.C.T.V.

For evidence and intelligence gathering different specifications may

be    desirable           than        those    for    crowd         control         and safety.       Accordingly

the sub-committee has now set up a working party to examine the best

advice on the use of C.C.T.V. for crowd control.                                             On 29th July 1988,

following          presentations              by    the    Secretary           to    "football       conferences"

and    to    the ACPO            national conference,                   a paper       was circulated by the

Chairman         to       Chief         Constables          outlining           the        related        strategies

recommended by the sub-committee in relation to the use of C.C.T.V.

and intelligence operations.                          These are attached at Appendix C.




Football Conferences




33.         The difficulty               of    disseminating              national         policy    has     always

been    accute.             In    the    area of          football         policing        there     is a greater

need for consistent policy and communication with other Forces                                                    than

in     almost             any         other        area     of          policing.           The      reasons        are

self-evident.                Almost           uniquely         we        are    always        policing        events

involving          some level of participation with other Police Forces.                                             In

a word we are policing a crowd and hooligans                                          from    another       Division

or another Police Force.




34.         In     1986          in     an    effort       to       improve           liaison       and     increase

consistency           a     system       was       set    up       to    provide       a   conference        at     the

season's         end        for        the     match       commanders               and    their     intelligence

officers for each Division of the Football League.




                                                               -   16-
35.          At each of these                conferences       the        ACPO       guidance       on policing

football          is    an     agenda    item       and   commanders            are     requested          for    any

views       as    to     its    update.             Copies    are also              issued    to     all       people

attending          the conferences.                 The     conferences have             provided          a    forum

for    wide-ranging             debate,       the    exchange        of    professional              information

and new ideas and the emergence of concerns for consideration by the

ACPO sub-committee.                 A copy of the minutes                      of    those    conferences          is

Liaison with other bodies




36.          Over        the    last     four       years     we    have        sought        to    improve       and

facilitate our liaison with other bodies                              and institutions                that have

a    role    in    dealing with the football problem.                                The Secretary of the

Sub Committee             is in frequent contact with the Football Association,

the    Football          League,       the    Professional          Footballers'             Association          and

the    Referees           and      Linesmen     Association.               On all        of        these       fronts

relationships             are    good     and    generally         a high level              of    co-operation

exists.




37.          As far as the Football Association is concerned recent areas

of    co-operation             include       close    attention           to    international              fixtures

(the Football Association in part funded the intelligence operations

undertaken         by     British        police      officers        in    West        Germany       during       the

European          Cup)       and     a       substantial           agreement           over        handling        of

misbehaviour on the field of play.




                                                            -17-
38.           There       are many matters of mutual                         concern between the police

and     the        Football            League,       in    particular        problems       concerning             the

scheduling of fixtures.




39.           In    the       general          context      match      commanders        are     inevitably         in

weekly if not daily contact with the secretaries of Football League

clubs     and        in       the       great        majority      of    cases       the relationship               on

practical matters                  is first          class..      At the            level of            policy the ACPO

Sub    Committee           through            its    Secretary        deals          with      current       issues and

the    Police           Service         has    no     difficulty        in    making      known       its     views.

Whilst    there          is       no    absolute coincidence of view on every issue,                                in

general there is a spirit of co-operation.




40.           It    should         be    mentioned         too    that       the   Secretary       of       the    Sub

Committee          is    ex-officio            a trustee         of the Football Trust.                  Over the

last few years the Trust have endorsed a number of spending schemes

to assist policing,                     most particularly in the area of closed circuit

television.




PROBLEM AREAS




Old Grounds




41.       Many football grounds                           are over 100        years      old    and    many more

were    built        at       a    time when          it was      sensible         for   the    stadium       to    be

close    at        hand       to       their        support.      Consequently           many     stadia          have

outgrown the sites on which they were built and rise ominously from

the    door-steps             of       terraced      housing     which       presses      almost       up    to    the

turn-stiles.               There          is        inadequate        parking        space       and        crowding




                                                               -18-
problems       are        compounded           by     narrow        streets.            It        is     extremely

difficult           to         sustain        free        routes      for        emergency               vehicles.

Immediately after a game the ground is often isolated for                                                up      to    an

hour    by    the    sheer       volume       of    people    making        their way to car parks,

trains,      coaches and the rest.                   Whereas much is made of large sums of

money involved in transfer                     fees, most of this money is often no more

than     credit          balances        circulated          within        the     League,             in        effect

exchanging          funds       from     the       wealthy     clubs       to    the     poorer          clubs         in

return for better players.                      Either way few clubs have had the money

if    they have          had    the wish       to    do     much to substantially improve the

structural       quality         of    grounds.        Many        are primitive             in    the       extreme

often     with      wholly        inadequate          toilets        and    refreshment                facilities,

often with uncovered areas of terracing and usually comprising in a

main     stand       a    warren         of    passages        and     rooms       which          are       at    best

inadequate.          Although          some     of    the    major     clubs       have           some      part       of

their    facilities            at an excellent standard, they all retain primitive

enclosures          for     the       less     articulate           members        of        their          support.

Football      stadia        have      been     tinkered with          over       many    years,          few were

actually      designed          to    be what        they    are     now.        Radial       and        perimeter

barriers      have       been     imposed      on     an    inadequate          infrastructure.                  Often

the     alignment         between         turn-stiles,             facilities       and           terracing            is

completely distorted.                   In short,         crowd supervision within the ground

and outside at turn-stiles usually consists                                 in making the best of a

bad job.




42.          k point        that      should be made here is that on most occasions

the bulk      of     the       crowds     are home         supporters        and    go       to    exactly            the

same place in the ground every match.                               They know their way and they




                                                            -19-
know     the     problems.                "Semi-finals"                played           at     neutral        grounds,

however,        are       entirely             made     up       of        away     supporters             where     this

directional sense is usually wholly absent.                                        Thus       it may be that on

these occasions the design failings of old football grounds are most

likely to surface.




Capacities and Safety Certificates




43.        The        safety          certification              process            involves          the      general

presumption that segregated parts of the grounds will be safe for a

given capacity.                If the structure has                       failings       then the capacity is

reduced    until          things       are      improved.            There        are    however difficulties

with    this     arrangement              particularly           where          the      area    in    question       is

terracing.        If       it    is    a large area but nonetheless                             sub-divided then

there    can    be    over-          crowding         in     some         parts    balanced           by    spaces    in

others.        Seating          of    course     would          determine          distribution on an even

basis, terracing certainly does not.




44.        One solution would be                       to make            the     segregated       areas       smaller

so that,       provided turn-stiles,                    facilities and terracing are properly

aligned,       capacities            in    a    given       segment         would        be     sufficiently         low

that    over-crowding                should      not       be    a    problem.           The     difficulty with

this proposal          is       that      in    the    event         of    fire     or       structural       collapse

there should be "expansion room" for the crowd to escape.




45.        In short the disadvantage of wide open terraces                                             is that the

crowd can concentrate,                    the    advantage            is    that        it provides         expansion

room.     This       is    a    fine      balance and probably needs greater                                 research.

Unquestionably however more seating would improve the distribution.




                                                                -20-
46.          Policing               arrangements              ideally           would            allow         officers

sufficient           access          to     the       crowd         so      that          they     could        act      to

"distribute" overcrowding and/or remove troublemakers.                                                  There should

be gangways          and access points well enough stewarded to allow passage

and there should be secure corridors as well giving protected access

to    critical       areas.           In general however                  it is in the very nature of

terracing          that        if    the        crowd       is      large       gangways           are        extremely

difficult to maintain.




47.          Not     to    labour         the    point,       if    grounds were being constructed

afresh well designed control mechanisms                                  could produce configurations

which would allow a much safer management of the crowd.                                                  As has been

indicated           the        alignment          between           queueing              areas,         turn-stiles,

facilities          and    spectator            areas    is      critical.           There is a balance to

be achieved between confining sections of                                      the    ground        so    that      undue

concentration             is    avoided         on    the     one      hand,     and       allowing        sufficient

expansion       room       for      safety       on     the      other.         In    reality           few    football

stadia        are     even           moderately             well         designed.               The     containment

arrangements have all been                       disjointedly             fastened          on     to    a basically

inadequate structure.




48.          A question that needs to be addressed here is the relevance

of    "all    seater"          stadia.          Historically             it has       been       tried with           very

disappointing             results.          Coventry was                a noteable          example           and   to   an

extent       other        clubs      have       greatly       increased             their     seating          capacity

only    to    find        spectators            reluctant         to     use    seats       or worse           eager     to

misuse them.              There are a number of considerations                                   which        are   to   be

taken    into       account.           Firstly,         if       seating       is    provided           the    area has

really to be covered.                      People       may      stand     in       the    rain     but       they will




                                                                 -21-
not    sit   in   the      rain.       Secondly,       there     is    a good        deal      of    consumer

resistance.        Many spectators simply want to stand in the traditional

way which they associate with "atmosphere".                              Thirdly of course there

is the question of cost                  and,    on    some    grounds,        the      risk    of    reduced

capacities.




49.      None       of      these        matters       are      fundamental           and       given       the

over-riding importance of safety                       and    the    obvious      benefits           in    terms

of    distributing         spectators       and       making    the     stadium more            manageable

all    seater      stadia        should         without       question       be      the     aim.         As    a

practical matter however it would probably be desirable to develop a

rolling programme requiring club management                             to progressively                  reduce

the    capacity       of    standing        areas      and     increase        the      availability           of

seating.       This      would     allow        spectators      to     gradually           adjust     and      be

more   realistic         from    the     club's       point    of    view.        Ibrox      is perhaps         a

powerful example of what can be achieved.




50.      As a final word on capacities                        the     ACPO   guidance           includes       a

recommendation          that the Police Control Box should have the facility

to monitor turn-stile              readings.           This    is     available         in   some     grounds

but    not   many     and    it     is    probably        timely      that     safety          certificates

require some system of monitoring                       accessible        to      the    Police       Control

Box.




51.      The      issue of Safety Certificates                      is fundamental to the whole

question of ground safety and to Policing.




                                                        -22-
52.        Safety         certificates           are    generally           complex            and    subject       of

detailed     scrutiny.             In    most      cases,           a     Safety      Committee         involving

Police,     Fire          Service,         Local         Authority            and,        sometimes.              Club

Secretary,        work     together        to    determine              specifications.              Whilst       this

is good practice,            its weakness              is that we have no                 guarantee          of     the

real expertise of those involved.                             After a tragedy,              in which so many

young lives have been lost, we really have to ask ourselves whether

the    guidance      in     the    "Green Code"           is sufficient.                 The point is made

again that there is a need for greater                              research into safety problems

and     greater       investment           in     the     training          of     those        who     make       the

decisions.




53.        A final        point     of     concern,          in     respect      of      Certification,             is

that    some grounds         are    now     owned       by     Local       Authorities           who    are also

the Certifying Authority.                  This appears to be wrong in principle.




Late Arrivals and Banned Spectators




54.        A common problem                for    police           concerns        the    late        arrival       of

fans.     If a train is late or perhaps                            a motorway blocked,                 it can       be

that    several      hundred        spectators           will        arrive      at      the     ground       after

"kick    off"     and,     particularly           if     it    is       a critical         fixture,      will be

clamorous       to    gain        entry.         There        is     an     argument           that     in    these

circumstances         the    "kick       off"     might        be       delayed.         The    problem       is    of

course    that       on    this     basis        kick     off times          will        inevitably          slide

further     and      further        back.         To    date there           has      not       really       been    a

convention about this               although it is always open                        to match commanders

to propose a delay to               the referee.




                                                          -23-
55.          A     further        problem         relates      to     people who      for no good reason

are late to reach the                   turn-stiles.                 It was    ACPO's    fear       that       if    an

absolute ban on alcohol was enforced at grounds,                                      and if indeed local

hostelries were closed,                      the effect would simply be to delay arrival

as fans went further afield to find "watering holes".                                           Guardedly it

may be said this             is generally the case.                      If fans know no alcohol                     is

available          some     are    more      likely to be late arriving.                       One answer to

this problem lies in timing critical fixtures                                  so that alcohol             is not

available          anyway,            for        example morning         or mid-day      kick         offs.          It

remains an open question as to whether the general                                      3 p.m.      "kick-off"

time is really appropriate.




56.          A     related issue            is    the      efficient          manning    of     turn-stiles.

Over    many       years     match         commanders          have    complained       about       not    enough

turn-stiles          being            open       or    not being       open early      enough.            As    with

stewarding          turn-stile          operatives             are    often    casual        labour    and          not

entirely           reliable.           These          matters        have     been     raised       with         Club

Secretaries          and,    certainly for major fixtures,                       should not now                occur

too often.           There is however a further problem at turn-stiles about

which       less    is    known        than       should       be.     The     intelligence         operations

referred           to       previously                suggest         that     turn-stile           fraud            is

wide-spread.              This     clearly            is   a   serious       matter     if    borne        out       as

capacities          could        be    exceeded            without      police    or    management             being

aware.        Some       means        of     auditing turn-stile operations                    is     necessary

and    it    is    proposed           to enter discussions with the League to discuss

this issue.

insisted           that for        some clubs,       Leeds          United       being   the        best     known

to    buy    tickets.            This     system    has       in     fairness       done       something          to

moderate             thereputation           of    Leeds      but        largely    by transferring              the

problem.          ACPO did not support the scheme in principle                               although they

agreed       to    stand by it.            In fact,       on the day,            many match commanders

faced with          a mob        outside     the   ground          and    insufficient           resources        to

Police       in    and    out,     simply let them in without tickets.                              This was       a

regrettable          reality but underlines                the      difficulties         associated with

"all ticket"             fixtures.        No doubt long term and short term solutions

are    in    conflict          here,    and no     doubt      resolve        in    favour        of   the       long

term should be best practice,                      but it is only fair to record that on

many occasions match commanders have acceded to the mob at the gate

and let in fans without tickets.




58.          One     other        group    of     banned      supporters           should      be     mentioned

namely those             subject to "exclusion orders".                      Suffice       it to say that

although          many    hooligans        were    excluded         under    the     provisions            of    the

Public       Order        Act,     1986     the    Courts          imposed       bans    for        such     short

periods       that       the     exclusion      scheme     became         wholly discredited in the

eyes    of     the       Police       Service.      Short        term      exclusion        is      simply       not

enforceable and certainly no deterrent.




Touts




59.          The     ACPO       Sub    Committee     has      for    sometime        registered concern

with     the       Home     Office        about    the     problem          of     ticket        touts.          The




                                                          -25-
difficulties          they present are principally two fold: firstly, because

they will       sell     tickets         to    anyone,      they       are    likely          to     disturb       the

segregation          arrangements         (away      supporters          for    example             will    be sold

tickets for the home sections of the ground); secondly,                                             because they

guarantee       the    availability            of    tickets      on     the day,            they effectively

encourage       people       without          tickets       to   attend        all           ticket       fixtures.

There     is    no    particular          offence        in      relation          to    ticket          touts     and

commonly the police               resort to arresting them either                             for       obstruction

or suspicion of forged tickets.                         Regrettably the ACPO were not able

to produce       factual evidence of a problem to satisfy the Home Office

of a need for legislation but the difficulty lies in knowing exactly

what    would       constitute          such    evidence         other       than        the       judgement        of

police    officers          on    the    scene.         There      undoubtedly                remains       a    clear

need    for    an    offence       making       it    illegal       to       trade       tickets           for    "all

ticket"       fixtures on match days.                   There may need to be some exemption

allowing the club to do so with the approval of the Police.




Communications




60.        The Police Service has                    long     struggled with                 the    problems       of

communications          on       major    sporting          occasions,          the          difficulties         are

commonplace         in the Service.             Principally the problem relates                              to   the

high level of ambient background noise associated with a large crowd

and technical gadgets such as ear pieces have not really compensated

successfully.          In    addition,         when     large      numbers         of men are deployed

there is often a problem of providing enough                                   channels            to    avoid    the

system    being       overloaded.             Many    forces       are       not        in    a    position       for

example to provide a dedicated command channel.




                                                         -26-
61.         Regardless,            good     communications            are     of       absolute         importance

and     two       issues          are     probably           of     great     assistance.               Land        line

telephones         at       key    points        connecting          to    the     Match         Control       are    of

critical       importance            and    secondly          good        C.C.T.V.       systems        will     allow

the   Control          to     survey       problems          themselves          reducing         the     need       for

reports back.




62.         Problems         of    communications             are simply technical however and

with a sufficient level of investment should be surmountable.                                                   It is

perhaps        the      case        that       investment            in     this        area       should       be     a

responsibility              of     the     football          club     and     more          clearly      addressed

within Safety Certificates.




63.         One    aspect which             is vital          is    the     siting       and      facilities         of

Control       Posts.          They       should        be    specified           to     give       an    all-round

perspective            of    the    grounds,          allow        C.C.T.V.       monitoring,            have       good

radio    and      telephone         links,        sufficient          room       for    liaison         with    other

services,         accommodate            maps,       plans    and    emergency           systems and so on.

Few   are     really         adequate          and    in     our    view     if        they      fall    short       the

global capacity of the ground should be restricted to 10,000.




64.         Communication               with     the        crowd     is     another           issue.          It    is

recommended good practice to have the ability to override the public

address system at any time in the interests of public                                              safety.          This

should be a rehearsed practice understood                                   by    both police            and    those

who     operate        the        system.        It     is    probably        valid         to    recommend          the

training          of        the     professional              broadcaster              to     present          police

messages.         It is suggested in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds




                                                             -27-
that    portable          public       address           systems          be    at    hand       to     speak      to    the

crowd.        Police experience                  is a little ambivalent in this area.                                   They

can be useful but in serious situations they tend to be ineffective.




Intelligence




65.           Paragraphs          23        -    28     refer       to     developments                in    the    police

intelligence             system        but        under           the     heading      of        "Problems"         it    is

reasonable          to    record       some        of    the       difficulties            police       have       in   this

direction.           First       of    all       with        43 separate Police Forces                        in England

and Wales       it is always difficult to obtain consistency of practice.

Equally       up     to     the       present           there       has    been       no    efficient          means      of

enhancing           the     system              and         enforcing           standard           practice.             The

development          of         the    National              Football           Intelligence                Unit    should

improve       the situation             but       there       is probably             a need          for    the    Police

Service to make a greater commitment in this area.




Costs




66.           The    cost of policing football                            is enormous.             Appendix E sets

out some details of what is involved.                                     On balance         football         clubs pay

approximately             30%    of    the       total       cost       (of which 30% is subsidised by

the Football Trust).                   It has been recognised of course that much of

the    policing          effort        is       directed          towards       the    crowds          on    the    public

highways       making       their           ways       to    and        from    the        fixture.           By    common

practice       these       officers             form     a   reserve        during         the    game       usually     on

duty     in    the        grounds       but        uncharged             for.        The    whole           business     of

charging       football           clubs         has      been       considered         and       re-considered           by

Police    Forces          over        the       last        few    years.         There          are    a     number     of




                                                                  -28-
difficulties.              There     is     some       disparity between                  Police Forces as to

the    rate    at which           charges         are made.             The    number       of    hours       charged

varies       and is bound to both because tours of duty may be longer for

large crowds          and major fixtures                    and/or because officers may have to

travel       long distances to               the grounds.               There is some ambiguity as                       to

what constitutes                "ground duties".                  If the physical perimeter of                           the

stadium is the dividing line then officers engaged in the duties of

turn-stile         supervision          (searching and queuing) would not                               be    charged

for.     Police opinion is that such duties                                should usually be regarded

as ground duties.




67.          There     is       another      area           of   difference          in    that        some       forces

charge       for    specific         numbers           on    a match       by match         basis       and       others

charge according to a formula rating matches                                    as "high",             "medium"      and

"low" priority, gauged over the season.




68.          From the club's point of view there is a feeling that police

charges       continue       to      soar        and    that       they    have      no     control       over       the

numbers       that    the       Chief       Constables            determine         are     required.             Whilst

this    is    true    in        reality they probably                     do    not fare         badly       from        an

equitable          point        of   view but          this       observation takes               no    account          of

their     ability          to     pay       or     otherwise.              Clearly         many         clubs       face

recurrent difficulties in meeting their creditors.




69.          At a practical             level there is sometimes                      a reluctance by the

police       locally to police additional                          fixtures         even where          there       is    a

willingness          to     pay      because           income       from       football          is    usually       not

directly available to the match                              commander         as   "overtime".              In    short




                                                                 -29-
internal budgeting arrangements                       for Police Forces where private cost

charges       are     involved         sometimes           present         difficulties          for     match

commanders.




70.           Whilst      it is thecase that Police Forces are bound to                                 police

what is there rather than what they would like to police,                                        the    burden

of    policing       football         often     falls      most       heavily      on    those        that   are

anyway hard pressed and at particularly                            busy       times.        If   any broad,

new    view   is     to be      taken about policing football                        some consideration

should be       given     to    the     difficulty          Police      Forces       face      in providing

the manpower given that under the present                               (legal)      arrangements only

a relatively small percentage                    of     costs     are      recoverable.           Whilst      it

can beargued that crowds                in public places are a natural part                             of the

police        responsibility           it can    also be         argued       that      football        crowds

have   become       a very      special problem and that perhaps                          some other way

of    funding       police     commitments           out    of    football         revenue        should      be

considered.          An     alternative         to     present         arrangements            might    be    to

raise a levy on persons attending football grounds                                      akin     to    the   old

"aviation security levy" at airports.                             If this proposal was properly

evaluated      a means         might     be     found      of    more      adequately          recompensing

police efforts.




Stewardina



71.       This       seemingly        innocuous        heading        in    fact     raises one of the

most contentious issues which has probably never been satisfactorily

resolved.       On    the      face    of it a football               stadium is privately owned

and the proprietors have a responsibility to conduct and manage the

ground    when       spectators          are     present         in     the    interests          of    public

safety.        Stewards are largely their agents to                           this effect.             In most

circumstances          this would be a fairly uneguivocable proposition.                                      The

debate however          surrounds the role of the police                          and     the      police     are

only     there      because       stewards     cannot       handle       football            crowds    without

the back-up of law enforcement officers.                           An acquiescent crowd could

well     be    managed by         stewards     alone    but    a crowd which                  has     time    and

again     demonstrated            an    eagerness      to     fight          on     a    mass        scale        if

unsupervised          by    police,      simply      cannot        be    controlled             by    stewards

alone.        Because of this, whatever the                  theory,          the       practice       in most

football       grounds      is    that   the    police control               ingress and egress and

determine what parts of the stadium will be kept clear and where the

divisions       between       groups     of    spectators      will          lie.       Usually       this        is

routine and stewards carry out an ancillary role in accordance with

the     police plan.          The question is therefore                   raised who            is in charge

of       crowd control            and    where       does    responsibility                  lie     for     the

management of fans?




72.           Mr.    Justice      Popplewell's       final     report         at paragraphs                4.13    -

4.19     discussed         this    issue.        Indeed      Mr.        Justice         Popplewell           took

evidence       from    the       Chairman     and    Secretary          of    the       Sub-Committee             on

this    point       and his       observations       very much          reflect         this.        In brief

the       final report         resolved       that     the police            presence         is     there    to

assist        enforcement         of    law    and    order        but       that        a    primary         and

continuing          obligation lay upon the proprietors to manage the crowd.

Mr.    Justice Popplewell noted that in the event of emergency,                                            police

inevitably take de facto responsibility for organising the crowd but

added this in no way lessened the obligations of the proprietor.




                                                      -31-
73.          Whilst Mr.          Justice Popplewell's                    remarks       are a wise and              fair

summary       of     the       situation          current       reflection             does         raise     further

questions.              Whilst        legal        responsibilities                may         lie       with         the

proprietor the "de facto responsibility" which falls upon the police

in the event of an emergency is conditioned in its effectiveness by

what    has       gone    on     before       -    otherwise         the        Service        is    very      much     a

"hostage to fortune".




74.          In    particular          if     capacity         control          and     packing          is     not     a

police       function,         which    commonly          (although         not    entirely)             it is not,

then handling the aftermath is a tall order.                                       Equally if the Police

exercise      priority          (which they always do)                    in marshalling segregation

of     the    crowd,           and     through       their          control        post,            C.C.T.V.        and

communications            dominate          the    means       of        crowd     control,           they      cannot

simply       say    it    is     at    bottom       a     matter          for    the     Club.           Most      Club

Secretaries         if     asked        would       simply          say     "the       police        control        the

match".       Whatever          the     legal       niceties         this       often     seems          to   be    the

reality.          Yet    because       police       control         is    only partial              in   the     sense

that     stewards,         turn-stile             staff    and       the        rest    have         considerable

duties, there are grey areas.




75.          The        Safety        Certificate              is        supposed         to         resolve        the

difficulties in part by laying down safe tolerances                                           such that in an

emergency         the    ground       and the men that run it,                     can cope.              The stark

reality may be however that a good many football grounds                                                 are simply

not    safe    enough      in        an emergency         if    they are at or near capacity -

given the present nature of football crowds.                                     Of course,           most of the




                                                           -32-
time     "capacities"             are    not        reached          and    the     problems          do    not        show.

But,    in the last analysis,                       safety is always a calculated compromise

and as practical men safety committees ask for what is possible.




76.        It may be that the ambiguous position of the police                                                    is part

of the problem - that is acknowledging the club's responsibility for

safety on the one hand,                       whilst routinely assuming all those tasks of

stewarding       which        the        stewards             cannot       do,     either        because          of     the

truculence        of        supporters             or     the    limited          talents      of     the        stewards

themselves,       on the other.                    It has to be said that                     the      present         lack

of    clarity     in these           arrangements                can      lead    to     something         of a        'dogs

dinner'.        In some clubs the police actively control                                      the stewards,              in

others     the         stewards           are           quite        independent          and,        despite           some

improvements,          standards              of    stewarding             vary    considerably             with       many

being too old or simply unreliable.                                       The Secretary is normally the

"safety         officer"           but             he         will        have      many         other           weighty

responsibilities on match days.




77.        It     may         be     better              to     acknowledge            that      if        trouble        is

anticipated        or        if     crowd           control          is    going       to     test         the     ground

capacities        then,       in     the       interests             of   public       safety,        police       should

take    control        over        the        stewards          through          their      supervisory            chain.

Stewards would continue to have a vital role in the strategy but two

issues would follow:                 first          if    "packing"         and     "gangway"          control         were

on     occasion        a    police        responsibility,                  the    police       might        require        a

different         standard               of         performance             from         stewards;               secondly

co-ordination              between       the       organisers             and    police       would        have    to     be

clear and formal.




                                                                 -33-
78.         It      is        necessary        to         re-iterate           some       observations             on

stewarding.             They    are    at best        casual       workers         (usually working               one

day    in    two        weeks),       they     are        probably           not     people        who     have     a

supervisory         role       in    ordinary        life       and    are     not    always       equipped        or

used   to    giving       directions         or     facing       obstruction,             many     are     retired

people,     and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee commitment.




79.         In    the     best      circumstances           there       should       be a well qualified

Safety      Officer,          someone     other         than      the    Club        Secretary,           a     Chief

Steward,         Sector        Supervisors          and    well       trained,        carefully           selected

Stewards.         All this is presently recommended.                               To make        it a reality

it would need to be a more                     carefully worded condition of the safety

certificate         with        mandatory         inspection            by     members        of     a     "Safety

Committee"         which       includes        the      police.          The       Chief     Steward          should

report      to    the     Match       Commander           and    maintain          liaison         with       Police

Control      and,        on     occasions         the      Match       Commander          should         have     the

authority to direct the Chief Steward.                                 The Safety Committee                   should

regularly         inspect           stewards        and     any       failings         should        result        in

sanctions.




80.         Regardless          the    police        have       over     the       last     few     years       been

concerned          to     encourage          clubs          to        improve         the     standards            of

stewarding.         Our guidance includes close liaison with stewards                                          as is

recommended         in    the       "Guide     to    Safety       at    Sports        Grounds".           We     also

recommend         police       take     an     active       role        in     training          stewards         and

recently         the Sub-Committee produced a training video which has been

circulated both to Police Forces and Football Clubs.




                                                           -34-
81.         Whilst there               is general      improvement           the     situation          is       still

rather patchy.               As stated earlier,              many stewards are too old or more

interested         in       watching         the     game     than       fulfilling             their        proper

function.          In particular             stewards        rarely      can     intervene           effectively

in    the   face       of    troublesome           supporters.          There       has       however       been     a

marked      improvement in the conduct and organisation of fire stewards

and the manning of exit doors is probably constant.




Training




82.         As     a     very      practical          business        which         is    routine           to     the

Sub-Division which hosts                     the ground,       policing football as a skill is

generally        "picked         up"    by   all     ranks    who     are      new       to    it.     For        many

"specialists"           such      as mounted,         motor       cyclists,         support          groups,       and

the like it is a fundamental part of their duties                                     learned within the

context      of       on-going         events.       Recognising          that       support         from        other

Divisions        is    often      necessary,         good     briefing         is    both      essential           and

general.         The ACPO Sub-Committee recently issued a training video to

all Forces on "briefing" for football.




83.         Specialist            Training          Courses       for     C.C.T.V.            operators            and

Intelligence Officers are hosted by Greater Manchester Police.




84.         Whilst          it is inevitable that much will have to be learned in

the    doing       the       question         of    more      specialist            training          for        match

Commanders         is       an    issue       which     needs       to      be      considered.              Safety

certification,              crowd       movement       and        safety,           communications,                the

intelligence             system,          C.C.T.V.           strategy,           evidence             gathering,




                                                           -35-
membership             schemes        and      the     rest,           are     now     all        difficult        and

specialist            subjects.            Furthermore,               the     need     for        consistency      of

practice         has    been       underlined         several          times    in     this       submission       and

training is the most likely vehicle to achieve it.




85.         The       case     of    a match         Commander's             training       course       cannot    be

separated         from       the     need     for     more       research        and       evaluation.        Taken

together         the     possibility            of     a    developing           package          of    operational

practice         is     most        attractive.            The        subject        may     be    ideal     for     a

"Carousel" course at the National Police College.




The Football Spectator Bill




86.          Police          views       on    this        matter       have      been        made       reasonably

clear.       Compulsory membership                   imposes the likelihood of considerable

resource costs to achieve enforcement but holds out some prospect of

greater crowd discipline.                       The ACPO have                been more        concerned       as   to

the detail than the principle and have sought to emphasise that the

most careful consideration must be given to issues                                          like the capacity

of    the    "agency"         to     prevent fraud;             the expertise of the                    "agency"   to

manage      the process             so   that    it    is       effective;       and       the     robustness      of

the    technology            and     the      regime       at    turn-stiles.              The    ACPO    views    on

these       matters       are       well      set     out        in     the     attached          correspondence

(Appendix F ) .




87.         It    is     the       resolution        of    these        issues       which       will    determine

the balance of advantage between the amount of police time invested

to make       the      scheme        viable     as against any noticeable                         improvement in

crowd behaviour.

CONCLUSIONS




88.          Over the last few years the ACPO has done much to highlight

best       practice       and co-ordinate a nationally consistent approach.                                      It

is    of    course       the    responsibility of                  individual       Chief       Constables       to

interpret       national guidance within their own domain.                                       On balance we

have fared well               in relation to the development of match information

and liaison between forces and other agencies and we are probably on

the    brink        of     major        improvements               on     the     "intelligence"           front.

National       guidance         is     reasonably         sound         but    probably limited by lack

of    systematic          research          into      crowd      safety         issues     -    in     particular

police       concern       with       hooliganism         sometimes            narrows     vision      on safety

matters.           Whilst       there         is    a     conference            system     to     spread     best

practice       there       is   probably           now    a training need for Commanders.                        So

complex       and    technical          has     the      policing         of    football        become    that    a

rethink       on     the       preparation          of     match         Commanders        is    probably     now

imperative          but       must     be     linked      with          more    research        into     managing

crowds.




89.          Two     issues          cast   a      shadow     over       these    general        observations:

the    poor    quality          and     inappropriate              location       of      so    many     football

grounds; and the vexed question of "who's in charge".




90.          Each        of     these         matters         is        intractable.            The    wholesale

relocation of football grounds                           is not possible but some                     substantial

things        can        be     done        within         the          existing         framework.         Three

opportunities in particular may be pursued:




                                                            -37-
(a)       critical       fixtures        test grounds               much    beyond          a     normal              game,

              special     games        should          only        be     played           at        grounds           with

              excellent       facilities          (and       the    League       and       F.A.       may    need        to

              identify and improve some key venues);




(b)       the process of certification needs to be placed on an                                                   annual

           basis        and    safety        committees             need     more          guidance              on     the

              "whole"    concept        of       safety       in    grounds,           i.e.          not    just        the

           physical       tolerances of structures but                           configuration               and        the

              relationship       of     space          and    crowd        behaviour             as    a     process.

           Overall capacities may well need to be reduced;




(c)       a    programme        to    provide          seating,          eventually             to    cover           most

           spectator          sections       of    the       stadium,       needs       to be          implemented

           universally.




91.       As to the question                of    "responsibility"               the       matter           of     civil

liability should not cause us to resile from hard decisions                                                      if they

are    necessary.         Dual       responsibility                for     safety          is     a    recipe          for

confusion.          The Police are always going to seize the initiative in a

crisis;       crowd control          is always going               to be     inextricably                  linked       to

criminal hooliganism;                the Police are never going to accept direction

from    stewards;         stewarding             will        never        (at     least              not     in        the

foreseeable         future)     be     able       to     cope      without       some           law    enforcement

back-up;       and finally Police do               "own" most of                the means             of     control.

In    these    circumstances          the    Police          must       accept    a    leading             role       and,

despite       the   requirements         and      civil       liabilities             of        football          clubs,




                                                          -38-
themselves                take     on        supervision         of    the       overall       conduct       of    events

wherever crowd safety is an issue.                                    This       responsibility itself turns

upon:




(a)         greater               research        to        provide          a     professional             corpus        of

             knowledge;




(b)         the better training of match Commanders;




(c)         through              the    safety     certificate              process,       the    improvement            of

             the           means        of    control       particularly            communications,               control

             posts, C.C.T.V., etc.




92.          Despite             all     these     things         safety          will     always       be        in     the

balance          if       crowd        behaviour       is    unreasonable,               those    who       by    violent

design disturb the equilibrium of large crowds so as to unleash the

terrible         pressures              which great numbers                  can so precipitately create,

carry       an    awesome          responsibility             - as          do    the    Police       and    Courts       in

properly bringing them to book!




93.         As        a    final observation but perhaps of ultimate                                   significance

is    the    matter          of        compliance.          Whilst          the    Police      Service        has      gone

some    way       to        establish          a code       of    best       practice       (which has            focused

primarily             on    the        public    disorder             aspects),         safety    matters          remain

largely          localised              in    concept       and        in    application.             The     Guide       to

Safety       at       Sports           Grounds    is    merely          a    guide       and     in    no     dimension

mandatory.                 Many        "certifying"         authorities             have       just     one       club    to

consider          and       no     real       comparative         yardstick.              This    submission             has




                                                                  -39-
several    times      raised the question of research and training but these

developments alone are not a guarantee of performance.                             It is beyond

the immediate scope of this document to outline the actual structure

which would establish and empower such a body,                        but it is considered

that   there     is    a need   for    a     Safety    Inspectorate which would have a

wide   if not     national      purview,      and would       be   both   the   repository      of

knowledge and the purveyor of best practice on all matters affecting

ground    safety.        Such    a    body     may    need    to     be   multi-disciplinary

(involving       the     Police,      Fire     and    Ambulance      Services      as   well    as

structural engineers and a representative from football).                               It would

not    replace     the   certification         process      but    inspect   and   support     its

affairs.
