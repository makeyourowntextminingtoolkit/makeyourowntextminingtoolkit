f an s    were       milling            outside,           most         of       them       had     d ri n k s .         They        were        in

goad      humour         at       this    t im e      giving            no       ca u s e     for       concern          other        than         the

fact      t ha t     the      pub wa s         open        in the            first          place.            I discussed               th i s        with

th e     communications                  sergeant            who        told        me      that        the       pub    ha d    been

designated             by the           Notts,        f a ns       as    a meeting                 p l ac e as          they     had        parked

in th e        same      area          last    year        when         the       pub       ha d    been          open.         I recalled

that      I ha d       been        on    the    s a me       p at r o l          area       the     previous             year        when

considerable                 numbers          ha d    been         drinking              at      the        pub a n d        I noted with

dismay         that      the       numbers           were      far       greater              than          the    previous           y e a r.          On

continuing             my     patrol          I noticed             th a t        the       fans        outside          the     Royal           H o t el

were      beginning               to    increase.              In v i e w           of w h a t          I had s e e n           I contacted

match        control          and       spoke        to    the      duty          sergeant.                  He    informed           me        that

all      the    pubs         in    the a r e a        had      been          visited             and asked              to   close.             Seeing

the      pubs       th a t    were       open and            the        number           of      people           drinking           I realised

we     were     in a         no w i n     situation.

of     them      obviously            ha d     had      plenty         to    drink        by this           tim e .        By     th i s     time

I saw      that        there         were      Police         officers            present         on the          road       opposite

th e    pub.        As     time       went       on     1 saw       there         wa s    a steady           flow      of       fa n s     along

Penistone           Road        and     from N eepsend                 Lane       many      of    them       ha d     obviously              been

drinking.              I noted a              build      up    of      fans       outside         The V i c t o r i a Hotel

w h i c h w as      situated            along         the     r oa d    from        The     Owl    public           ho u s e .        To     the

best      of my        recollection most                      of    the      people         in the          area were             connected

with      the N o t t s .        Forest          team.

Just      before          2pm    that         da y    we w e r e       c a l l e d to      Th e    Victoria            Hotel          and      on

number          of F o r e s t       fans      stood        outside          the      pub.        They were             in h i g h

spirits          and      were       shouting          and waving              at     the      stream        of F o r e s t         fans       w ho

were      passing          by    in     cars.           I went         into       the     pub w h i c h w a s           packed with

football           supporters              who       were     in a b o i s t e r o u s           mood and           obviously              many

had     had      plenty         to    dr i n k .        1 spoke         to     the       licensee           and     informed             him      to

control          the      people        drinking            outside          otherwise            he w o u l d        be     closed          down.

respective             partners.               On my a r r i v a l           I saw        that a        crowd         of     fans        were

being      dispersed             away         from     the     front         of     the     pub.        I saw         t ha t      many       of

these      were        worse         for      drink.          1' n o t e d     that       the     frontage            of     the      pu b was

cleared.            I was        informed             that there             had been          trouble           and       t ha t     they

had     been      stopped            serving.            I spoke            to C h i e f       Inspector            Price         who      was

v is i t .       I then           left     Mr.       Price's          location which                   by t h is    time        had

nearly          cleared and               returned           to T h e       Victoria.             On m y a r r i v a l            1 saw

that       things          ha d    eased        slightly            since        my     last      visit.        There         were

people          s t il l    on     the     pavement           drinking            and     the      pub w a s       still        full.          I

saw    that PC             Pickering            and a number                of    special          constables            were       in

attendance.                 1 considered                  that      there        wa s    no     immediate          c au s e     for

concern          at    the        pu b    so    I continued               my     p at r o l .      On my way          past         the

communications                    vehicle           1 sa w    t ha t      there         was     st ill    a   lar ge       number         of

fans       outside          with         drinks.           I could          see       that      they were          boisterous             and

many       had       obviously            had       plenty       to      d ri n k .

I returned             to     the        Neepsend          area       sometime           after         2.30pm.        As      I

travelled along                    Penistone              Road      towards           Hillfoot          Bridge      I saw a           large

number          of    fans        streaming           along         Penistone            Road      towards         the     ground.

They were             in a b o i s t e r o u s            mood      but     there        wa s     no    specific         trouble.              It

was    obvious             that        many     of    them       had       been       drinking.            O n my a r r i v a l          into

Neepsend Lane                 I saw        that       the Owl            pub     had     j u st    c l osed.         I was         informed

that       there       had        been     some       trouble            and     they     stopped          serving.               I w e nt

into       the       premises            and    found        it n e a r l y       e mp t y .       By    this      time       as    the

area       had       began        to     clear       and     I considered                commencing           security             patrol

of N e e p s e n d         car     par k s.          As    k i ck     off      t im e    approached           I could             hear    over

my    personal             r a di o      that       there     w as       a build         up of L i v e r p o o l         fans       in the

Leppings             Lane     area        near       to    the      turnstiles.                 I could       hear       t ha t

officers             there        were     experiencing                  difficulty             controlling           the         crowd.           I

could        h e ar    requests            being          made      for m o r e         police         officers.           As      the

messages             increased            1 could          hear       crowd       noises          in the      b ackground and

they       sounded          hostile.                I heard Superintendent                         Marshall         ask       for     a g a te

to    be     opened         because            pressure          of      the     c r o w d was         becoming       so      intense

that       he    feared           there        was    going         to    be     serious          injuries.           I could            hear

the    fans          w e r e trying            to    climb       o ve r     the w a l l s         to    get   in.        I again

heard a         request              from      the        Superintendent                 to       open a gate             and     it s o u n d e d

t h at    t h er e    was          s om e     problems           getting            a key.           The      crowd       noise        in the

background was                     getting           l ou der.           From       other        messages           I could         hear

there        was     immi n en t            threat          that     people           we re g o i n g         to    be    crushed.            I

could        hear     further               requests           to    open        the     g at e      from      the       Superintendent

and with            each       request           he       sounded more                frantic.             I heard          a    request          for

the      st a r t    of       the     match          to     be d e l a y e d .          < I do       not      know       w ho    made     it)

background which                      had      turned          into       a     roar.          After       t ha t    radi o       traffic

seemed        to     stop and               it w a s       a few         short        minutes         after a            call     was

received            from           match       control          deploying              all      handlers            into the       ground

via Gate            *0'.           1 immediately assumed                          that       we     were      being        called

because        of a s e r i o u s              crowd         disorder            and     thought           there         must     have       b ee n

a    pitch      invasion.                   I cannot           r ec a l l       the     precise          t im e     this        call    was

received            but       we    arrived           at     Gate        ’O ’ w i t h i n        three        minutes.            On arrival

with      other       handlers                I went         straight            onto        the     ramp      leading           onto    the

p i t c h at        the H o p         end where              the     Forest           f an s    were       situated.              From where

I was        stood        1 could            see      that      the       g a me      had      been      stopped.               1 could       see

as     far    as     the           penalty           area     to     the      goal      from where I was                   stood       and      on

o ur     arrival          I        saw a y o u t h          running           around           in f r o n t of      the F o r e s t

supporters.                He       was      waving          his     hands.            The      Forest         f an s     were     jeering

at     him.         1 saw          two      Police         officers             run a f t e r       hi m a n d       pursue        him       out

was      obviously              a    person with medical                           experience                 saw    to    it     that        the

he     saw      to    it     t ha t       one     of       his       helpers          remained            with       the     youth.            I saw

at     this        t im e    t ha t       the     p a r t i t i o n was            a means           of       segregation              between

dead and             injured          p eo p l e .          By       this       time       I saw         that m a n y        of    the        people

being        carried            into       the        gym were             dead.           My    intention            no w wa s          to    return

to     the      pitch        to a s s i s t           in f u r t h e r          recovery            of    the       injured.             But    at

that        t im e    1 was          instructed                 to    deploy          the       dogs      into       the     ground           into

the      front        of     the      Kop       the        reason          being        to      enable         the    release            of    other

officers             wh o    were         there        on       crowd         co n t r o l .

Dogs        were      then          deployed           as       instructed              at      SO yard         intervals.                We

remained             at     t hi s    position              unti l         the m a t c h         wa s     officially              abandoned.

Shortly            after        this       we     were          deployed           outside           the       stadium.            I made            my

the     front          of    the       ground         I saw      th at      fighting        had j us t        taken          place       in

front        of    the       turnstiles.                The      Police        in a t t e n d a n c e    appeared             to      have

the     matter          under          control.

While        I wa s         at    my    point         I received            a general           call    for    assistance

outside           Muschet          Tools,         Penistone            R o a d , where          fighting       was       reported              to

be     taking          place.           On my arrival                 all     was    quiet.

Before         standing            down         from    duty       I completed a                public    order          patrol          in

th e    city w h ere              apart         from    one      or    two     isolated          incidents          all       appeared

to     be    reasonably                quiet.

I cannot           comment             upon      the L i v e r p o o l        fans     other      than what             I heard          on

the     radio          but       speaking         of    the N o t t i n g h a m        fans      although          there        appeared

to     be    no    serious             incidents          attributed            to     them,      I felt       t ha t        too m a n y

of     them were             involved            in d r i n k i n g      on    their       way    to    the    ground           and      if

any     real       trouble             had      flared      up     I know where             I would       h av e        attached            the

blame .

With        regards          to    the       incident         leading          to    the    disaster          all       I can

comment           on    is w h a t        I heard         o ve r      the     radio.        It wa s      obvious             t h at    the

l ar g e     number          of    fa ns        who    had a r r i v e d       at    the    turnstiles             at    Leppings

Lane        had    put       the       officers         there         under     extreme          pressure          and       listening

to     the     frantic            transmission              from Superi n t e n d e n t            Marshall             to    o p e n the

gate        it a p p e a r e d         t ha t    someone         was     going       to    be     seriously             injured          or

killed         unless            something            positive         w as    done.

With        regards          to    the       injured        youth        I was       not    in a       position          to     obtain

hi s    identity             and       can      only    describe            h i m as      being    of m e d i u m        height,

slim        build,          short       dark      hair,       wearing          li g h t    coloured       shirt          and       d a rk

trouser s .

During         the      time       the       dogs      were      deployed           in the       ground       PC    B l a d e n ’s

concerned youths                       running         into      the     dog.        It    is not       known       if a n y          injury

               With    regards       to    previous          experience        at     the    ground.          I have        policed

               twelve       years    and    it       is    hard    to   remember       when      I last       saw       so m a n y

               people       drinking       on    their       way    to a m a t c h .

               The    ingredients          of    fine       weather       and alcohol          seem      to   be a       recipe       for

               trouble.

               I would       suggest       in    future       the       only way      to a v o i d t r o u b l e    in t hi s         type

               of    big    occasion       match          would    be   to   play     games      on   Sundaymorning              before

               the    pubs    open,       thereby          removing      a v i t al    ingredient.
