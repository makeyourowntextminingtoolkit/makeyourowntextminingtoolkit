A r e p o r t by the Clerk and Financial O f fi c e r was submitted on p o s s ib le
Government funding of Neighbourhood Watch Signs, and atta c h e d to the
r e p o r t was a l e t t e r from the Home O ffice.

The Home O ffice had pointed ou t t h a t the Government did not provide
funding f o r Neighbourhood Watch S t r e e t s i g n s , because the schemes were
voluntary and as such th e lo cal community should be encouraged to make
sure t h a t they had the commitment and resources necessary fo r t h e i r
success.

The Home O ffice had a ls o commented t h a t although they regarded s t r e e t
signs as d e s i r a b l e , they were not e s s e n t i a l to th e success of
Neighbourhood Watch Schemes.

any d i f f i c u l t y over fin ancin g i t s s i g n s ; indeed schemestook a p rid e in
