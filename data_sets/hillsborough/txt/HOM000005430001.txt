HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE: INQUIRY INTO THE POLICING OF
FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM


1.   I attach a draft memorandum of written evidence (without
annexes) which it is proposed should be submitted to the Home
Affairs Select Committee for their inquiry into the policing of
football hooliganism.   It has been cleared with other Divisions in
the Department and shown to the Association of Chief Police
Officers.


2.   Ministers will particularly wish to note the current drafting
of part 4 of the Memorandum which deals with Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations.   Paragraphs 4.16 and 4.17 cover the proposed new
offences on which the Government's intentions have yet to be
announced.   The Home Secretary wrote to the Lord President on
20 August to seek colleagues' agreement to legislate at the
earliest suitable opportunity.     Responses so far have been in
favour of the Home Secretary's proposals but the Lord President
himself has yet to reply.     We may need to adjust the terms of
these paragraphs when his reply is received.     If it is agreed that
we should legislate, Ministers may wish to announce their decision
before the Memorandum has to be submitted to HAC on 28 September.
If Ministers agree, we will prepare a press notice for this
purpose.


3.   A further recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor was to
consider extending the scope and duration of the attendance centre
orders.   Although the Home Secretary has decided in principle
against such a move, this has not yet been announced.     There seems
no harm in including the paragraphs (4.18 and 4.19) as drafted but
the Home Secretary should be aware that it will be the fir s l ^
occasion that the information has gone into the public domain.     In
practice it will be some time before the Memorandum of evidence is
published by the Committee and we may have made the decision more
generally known in other contexts before then.


4.   The same situation arises in respect of paragraph 4.20 which
is the first time we have given our reaction to Taylor's
recommendation on electronic tagging.     The reaction seems
uncontroversial and suitable for inclusion in the Memorandum.


5.   Are Ministers content for the Memorandum to be submitted as
drafted to HAC?

HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE INQUIRY INTO POLICING FOOTBALL
HOOLIGANISM


HOME OFFICE MEMORANDUM



1. - INTRODUCTION


1.1         The     Home   Office's   memorandum      has   been   prepared   in
consultation with the Department of Environment, who have primary
re^p>nsibility for Government sporting policy.


1.2          Hooliganism has occurred in many forms and in varied
contexts     over    many    years    but   it   has    become     particularly
associated    with     football.      Examples   of    football     hooliganism
involving pitch invasions, attacks on referees and players, and
fights between rival fans can be found going back one hundred
years and more.


1.3         Mr Justice Popplewell in his inquiry into Crowd Safety
and Control at Sports Grounds (Cmnd 9710, January 1986) reached
certain conclusions about football hooligans one of which was
that "there has always been a group, albeit a small group, who
find violence attractive; who currently find the football ground
a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
the occasion for display of their aggressive tendencies which on
other days and at other times they will be exhibiting in public
houses, the city centre or elsewhere".           That view, and associated
more detailed analysis, was endorsed by Lord Justice Taylor in
his report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster (Cm 962, January
1990)   with the qualification that the consumption of alcohol
serves to make less committed hooligans more inclined towards
violent behaviour.          These are conclusions which the Government
accepts.

                                        1
1*4             The role of the Government in relation to football
hooliganism is to ensure that legislation is in place to give the
courts and the police the powers they need to prevent violence,
disorder and other unacceptable behaviour as far as possible and
to deal with it as it arises.                 This involves at national level
the Home Office working closely with the police and at a local
level     the    police       working   closely     with       the   clubs    and    other
organisations concerned to see that practical arrangements exist
locally such that spectators                 can watch the event safely and
enjoyably.           The Government interprets its responsibilities as
extending to international co-operation for the prevention of
misbehaviour by our citizens abroad.


1*5             It    is    generally   accepted        that    there   is    no    si^^Le
explanation for the hooligan behaviour attached to football and
there is no single remedy.              Mr Justice Popplewell concluded that
"however close social scientists get to determining the true
cause of violence on the football terraces, no complete cure can
be prescribed, even for the very long term".                         He went on to say
that "by taking proper preventive measures it may be possible to
stop violence inside a sports ground".                    It is towards this end,
and ensuring safety generally - two concepts which are inter­
related - that, with full Governmental support and encouragement,
the policing of football inside grounds is concerned.


1*6             But    hooliganism perpetrated            by    football      supporters
extends    beyond          the   terraces,    often     spilling      over    into    town
centres,    sea fronts, and transport systems.                       It extends, too,
beyond    this        country    as British      fans    follow      their    clubs    and
national    teams          to matches   and tournaments          abroad.       Thus the
policing        of    football     is   a    much   wider      responsibility         than
patrolling the tsrx'aces on a niatchday afternoon.                           It requires
local, national and international measures to be co-ordinated
and made effective.




                                             2
2 - THE PRACTICALITIES


2.1           The police regularly provide large numbers of officers
in connection with football matches to maintain public order,
apprehend offenders and to direct crowds both inside and outside
grounds. The cost of this police presence is substantial in terms
of money and police manpower which could be otherwise deployed.


2.2           Football is a popular spectator sport.        The 92 Football
League clubs compete with every other club in their Division of
the League during the season which extends from August to May.
There were over 19,000,000 attendances at Football League matches
during the 1989/90 season and on Saturday afternoons there are
        400,000 to 500,000 people at such games.           The larger clubs
in Division 1 regularly attract 30,000 to 50,000 spectators and
the crowd at Wembley Stadium for the final round of each year's
FA Cup approaches 80,000.


2.3           The number of police officers to be deployed inside
the ground is a matter for the judgement of the police Ground
Commander after discussion with the club concerned.           His decision
will take into account the expected level of attendance,                 the
club's past      record and that of visiting supporters, the nature
and location of the ground, and the level of stewarding provided
by the club.      At the smaller clubs policing may require as few
as    30-40   officers,   particularly   if   there   is    little   trouble
anticipated at a particular fixture.          At the larger clubs some
300 officers may be required on a normal matchday, or more if
the clubs do not have a record of good supporter behaviour.


2.4           Central records of police expenditure do not identify
the costs of       policing football     or other     specific activity.
However,      a sample by ACPO of two Saturdays        in November 1988
showed an average of 5,000 officers deployed on football duties.
The police considered this sample to be broadly representative
of the season as a whole.        The total cost of police resources


                                    3
would depend on the precise rates of pay and periods of duty of
each officer involved, but an indicative cost might be in the
range of £200,000 to £300,000 per "football Saturday'*.                 Apart
from the financial cost the number of officers is significant
because of the extent to which the officers are drawn away from
other police duties.


2.5          As a "special service" within the meaning of section
15 of the Police Act 1964 a charge to the club is made for the
police presence inside a ground.          These charges are a matter for
the police authorities who are currently in consultation with the
Association of Chief Police Officers over the terms of a uniform
charging policy.       The Home Office is, in accordance with one of
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, preparing to issue further
guidance on this issue.       The costs of policing football mat^p^s
not recovered from clubs are met from public expenditure.


2.6          The policing of football is not confined to the ACPO
forces at the ground and in its immediate environs.            The transit
systems are policed by British Transport Police (BTP) with some
900 officers fully or partly committed on main match days.                  The
BTP   have   a   dedicated   Football     Liaison    Unit   which    collates
intelligence      on   travelling   supporters      and   arranges    regular
liaison with local police forces, British Rail and other travel
organisations, the football clubs and associations.


2.7          The annual criminal statistics published by the Home
Office show numbers of offences recorded by type of offence, not
by circumstances, so offences at football matches or otherwise
related to football are not recorded as a separate category.
However, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) collates
for each football season the total number of people arrested at
or ejected from Football League matches.              (Arrests at grounds
include   those    made   outside   but   directly    connected      with   the
policing of matches.)        Figures for recent seasons were given in
Answer to a Parliamentary Question on 4 July 1990 a copy of which
is at Annex A.


                                     4
2.8         In considering figures of arrests and ejections for
individual League clubs it should be recognised that the figures
are for those made at the home ground and do not cover only
'home'    supporters.       Arrest figures by themselves may not be a
precise measure of the level of disorder since they take no
account of the seriousness of offences, nor of cases which do not
result in conviction.          However,      the figures give some overall
measure    of   the   scale of   trouble          at matches    during a season
although there are occasions, for example on the last full day
of the season, when the number of offences may increase markedly.
On 5 May 1990, for example, there were over 200 football-related
arrests    across     the    country,       104    of   which   took   place   in
Bournemouth.


2.9         Nevertheless, the statistics provide the best available
indication of the scale of the problem and the recent downward
trend of arrests and ejections and the rise in attendances gives
cause for cautious optimism.

3 - RELEVANT LEGISLATION


General


3.1           The offences which hooligans may commit during bouts
of    disorderly        activity    in    and     around    football         grounds   vary
greatly in         type and seriousness.               At one end of           the   scale,
section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 makes it an offence for
a person      to    use    threatening,         abusive    or    insulting words          or
behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, or to display any writing,
sign    or   other      visible     representation          which       is   threatening,
abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person
likely to be caused harassment,                     alarm or distress.           This low
        offence was introduced in the 1986 Act specially to catch
some    sorts      of   minor   misbehaviour          including     some       aspects    of
football      hooliganism       which         although     objectionable         had     not
previously been criminal.            The offence may be committed in public
places and, with a few exceptions, private places.                            A constable
may    arrest without warrant              a person who          does    not    stop   such
behaviour when warned              to do      so.     On conviction           the maximum
penalty      for    the    offence       is   a     fine   not   exceeding       level     3
(currently £400).


3.2           At the other end of the scale of public order offences
is riot,     covered in section 1 of the Act.                       This makes it an
offence where 12 or more persons who are present together use or
threaten unlawful violence for a common purpose and their conduct
(taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable
firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety.
The offence attracts a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment.


3.3           In between these two ends of the scale there are the
offences of violent disorder (section 2), affray (section 3) and
fear or provocation of violence (section 4) which attract maximum
penalties ranging from 5 years'                     imprisonment and a fine to 6
months' imprisonment and a fine not exceeding £2000.                             There is


                                              6
a specific offence in the Act to deal with threatening, abusive
or insulting words or behaviour which is intended to stir up
racial hatred or is likely to stir it up.                   A person reasonably
suspected of committing the offence can be arrested without a
warrant and on conviction can be imprisoned for up to 2 years and
fined.


3.4          There are many other offences, outside the scope of
the Public Order Act 1986, which hooligans may commit during
disorderly     activity.          The     offences    of    common        assault    and
malicious     wounding      are    examples.      The      gravest    incidents       of
hooliganism may involve murder or attempted murder for which the
maximum     penalty    is   life    imprisonment.          Criminal        damage    and
possession of an offensive weapon in a public place are other
offences which hooligans sometimes commit which can attract t^^is
of imprisonment.


3.5          Statute    law is not         the only means at the police's
disposal for coping with hooligans.                  Breaches of the peace may
be dealt with using common law powers.                If a breach of the peace
occurs or if the police reasonably apprehend an imminent breach
of    the   peace   they    may    take    any   reasonable     steps       which    are
necessary to control or prevent it, including arresting those
responsible.        They may bring the offenders before the courts
where   they may be bound over to be of good behaviour for a
period.


Alcohol


3.6          Various     specific       powers   in relation         to    alcohol   at
football matches are contained in the Sporting Events (Control
of Alcohol etc) Act 1985, as amended.                   In addition there is a
wide variety of general powers in relation to alcohol licensing
which have a bearing on alcohol in the context of football.


3.7          The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985
prohibits the possession of alcohol on the way to matches on


                                           7
football special coaches and trains and makes it an offence to
be drunk on them.     It also makes it an offence to try to enter
a ground when dx*unk or in possession of alcohol and to possess
or consume alcohol within view of the pitch during the period of
the match (from 2 hours before until 1 hour afterwards), or to
be drunk during the period of the match.         Although there is
provision for magistrates to grant exemption orders for bars in
the ground which have no view of the pitch,        the police are
empowered to close any such bar should they believe that the sale
of alcohol there is detrimental to orderly conduct or the safety
of spectators.      The 1985 Act also prohibits the possession of
any bottle, can or other container capable of causing injury to
a person struck by it.      All Football League grounds,   Wembley
Stadium and non-League grounds when used for matches involving
L e ^ ^ e clubs are designated under this Act.   The 1985 Act also
gives the police the power to search someone reasonably suspected
of committing an offence under the Act,     and to arrest such a
person.   Given the nature of offences under the Act this may
include searching coaches or trains carrying passengers to or
from matches or on arrival as well as searching fans waiting to
enter a ground or inside a ground.    All offences under the 1985
Act are summary only punishable with various levels of fine.


3.8       Schedule 1 to the Public Order Act 1986 extends the
Sporting Events   (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 to prohibit
alcohol on minibuses on journeys to or from a designated sporting
event, and prohibits the possession of a firework or similar item
at, or while entering, a designated sporting event.


3.9       British Rail have also introduced a byelaw under which
normal train services when transporting supporters to matches may
be designated as 'dry'.


3.10      Home Office Circular 68/1988    (Alcohol and disorder)
(see Annex B) issued on 5 August 1988 gave wide ranging advice
reminding courts and the police of relevant criminal offences
and powers to regulate licensing, including the power to close


                                 8
all licensed premises in an area when riot or serious disorder
is expected (section 188, Licensing Act 1964).


3.11          Experiments have        taken place        in some   areas with a
bvelaw which      prohibits     the public           consumption of alcohol    in
specified      areas.           One    of      the     participating   Councils,
Scarborough, included in its designated areas the roads leading
to and surrounding the local football ground.                   The measure has
been found to have an effect in reducing threatening, behaviour
and    will     be      available     in       suitable     circumstances     for
implementation by district and borough councils generally.


Exclusion of troublemakers


3.12          Under Part IV of the Public Order Act 1986 w h e ^ ^ a
football related offence as defined in the Act has been c o mmilRd
the courts may make an exclusion order prohibiting the offender
from attending prescribed matches if the court is satisfied that
such an order would help prevent violence or disorder.                      These
offences      include   those   committed not only           inside or outside
ground*,    but also on journeys to or from matches.                   Exclusion
orders are for a minimum period of three months with the maximum
duration at the discretion of the court.


3.13          From 1 August 1987, when this power was introduced,
to 1 August 1990 3071 exclusion orders have been recorded by the
Football Association.


3.14          After the exclusion order provisions had been in force
for 12 months, the Home Office found that a number of orders had
been made for a period which fell mainly within football's "close
season".      Charts of the analysis were circulated under cover of
HO Circular 74/1988 (attached at Annex C), to remind courts that
orders of short duration covering this period may serve little
practical purpose.




                                           9
3.15          The courts' power to impose exclusion orders is without
prejudice to a club's own entitlement to choose whom to admit,
or refuse to admit, to their property.                   Conditions under which
this   will     take   place    are    set    out       in   each    club's   Ground
Regulations,      which   normally     follow       a    model      drafted   by   the
Football League.       Ground regulations typically assert the club's
right to exclude someone who refuses to be searched on entry.


3.16          Part II of the Football Spectators Act 1989 introduced
the restriction order provisions which enable courts to impose
orders to prevent those convicted of football-related offences
in England and Wales from travelling to key matches abroad, by
requiring them to report to a police station in this country at
tlMktime the match is to be played.            The period of a restriction
o r W r is two years, or five if the person is given a sentence of
immediate imprisonment.


3.17          The 1989 Act also provides for restriction orders to
be made in respect of "corresponding offences" committed outside
England and Wales subject to bilateral agreements with individual
countries.     This power has been available since 1 June in respect
of offences committed in Italy and Scotland;                  it is intended that
similar agreements should be reached speedily with other members
of UEFA    (including Sweden,         hosts of the forthcoming European
Championships).


3.18          The restriction order provisions are administered by
the Football Spectators Restriction Orders Authority (ROA).                         In
accordance with section 21 (1) of the Act, the Secretary of State
issued guidance to the ROA on the discharge of their functions
and a copy of this is at Annex D.


3.19          The ROA's main functions are to:


       -      maintain    a   record of      those      individuals      subject    to
              restriction orders;



                                       10
       -        issue notices requiring individuals to report during
                a period of time which would prevent attendance at a
                specific foreign match;


                consider and decide on requests for exemption from
                reporting.


3.20            Between 24 April 1990, when the provisions came into
force, and 1 August the ROA had been notified of 15 restriction
orders.     Of those 14 arose from convictions made by Chesterfield
Magistrates' Court in connection with the Chesterfield v Grimsby
match on 5 May 1990 and were made in time to impose reporting
requirements for World Cup matches. The other order was made in
connection with the Bournemouth v Leeds United match of the same
date   (and further orders may be made in respect of the o U e r
defendants).       The low number of orders made to date reflects the
fact that the provisions only came into force towards the end
of the last football season.


3.21            The ROA is funded as a common police service, set up
under section 41 of the Police Act 1964.                  It currently has five
civilian staff.


Community disposals


3.22            Where a person is convicted of an imprisonable offence
the court may make an attendance centre order.                 Most attendance
centres are open on alternate Saturdays, often in the afternoon.
An attendance centre order may therefore help prevent an offender
from attending football matches.


3.23            Community    service orders may          also be made where a
person is convicted of an imprisonable offence. These too deprive
offenders of their leisure time and emphasise the positive use
of such time by requiring the offender to undertake a specified
number     of    hours'     unpaid   work    for   the   community.   National
standards for community service were introduced in April 1989.


                                        11
3.24         The   court may    also     impose   a probation         order    on   a
convicted offender.        A probation order or a supervision order
(their     equivalent    for    juveniles    under       17)    may    include      a
requirement      for the offender not to participate in specified
activities over a specified period.               Such a requirement could
include an undertaking not to attend football matches.


The courts and penalties


3*25         The Government's role in relation to penalties is to
ensure that the courts have available to them adequate powers.
For most offences applicable to disorderly behaviour at football
matches custodial penalties are available.                Within the maximum
P^j^lties set by Parliament sentencing in individual cases is for
the courts themselves.


Responding to maior outbreaks of hooliganism - "Swift Justice"


3.26         Home Office Circular 62/1988 issued on 4 August 1988
(copied at Annex E) invited the courts, the police and others
to formulate contingency plans to bring very rapidly before a
court those involved in large scale disorder.                  Swift action was
intended    to   deter   further    outbreaks     and    to    demonstrate      the
determination of the agencies involved to deal with hooliganism.
The initiative envisaged disorder in general, but included that
arising in the context of football.


Conclusion


3*27         There is a number of wide ranging sanctions, some of
which have general application and some of which are specific
essentially to football,        which may be used by the police and
courts against football hooligans.           The offences created by the
Sporting    Events   (Control      of   Alcohol   etc)    Act    1985    and    its
licensing provisions have,          it is thought by the police,               been



                                        12
particularly successful in reducing disorder at and on the way
to and from football matches.


3*28       The   maximum      penalties      which     are    available     are
consistent with the seriousness of the offences to which they
apply; it is for the courts to decide what sentence to impose
in individual cases.


3*29       There are the additional measures of exclusion orders
and restriction orders.        Since the Government decided not to
proceed with the football membership scheme, exclusion orders,
which would otherwise have ceased to have effect,                    remain the
primary means      ofkeeping troublemakers out of grounds.               A Home
Office Circular,     69/1990, annexed at F was issued on 30 Avgust
1990, to remind prosecutors and the courts of the facility


3.30       The rigorous enforcement of exclusion orders is not
easy to achieve but, with the setting up of the NFIU and the
careful video surveillance of crowds to identify and subsequently
prosecute those in breach of an exclusion order, the sanction
will become more effective.


3.31       It      is too     early    toassess        the    operation      or
effectiveness of the new restriction order scheme which came
into effect in April this year.             However,   the extent to which
the "corresponding offences" provisions can be brought to bite
will   depend      in large    part    on     the readiness     of     foreign
jurisdictions to prosecute and convict British hooligans.                   The
European Convention on Spectator Violence at Sporting Events has
been encouraging parties in this respect.

4 - LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM
DISASTER



4.1         On 17 April 1989 immediately following the Hillsborough
Stadium Disaster Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the Home
Secretary    to   inquire   into the events   at     Sheffield Wednesday
football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations
about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events.
His interim report (Cm 765) was presented to Parliament in August
1989 and his final report (Cm 962) in January 1990.


4.2         The interim report made recommendations which he felt
wt^^ the minimum necessary        to ensure   that existing     football
grounds could for the present be safely used.          A number of these
he said should be carried out         before the start of the    1989/90
season and the rest as soon as possible.


4*3         In his final report Lord Justice Taylor made wider-
ranging recommendations (which included those from the           interim
report, amended or not) in the        interest of     promoting better and
safer conditions at sports grounds in the future.          The effect of
the reports has been to re-focus attention on the safety of the
vast majority of well-behaved supporters while keeping control
of the badly behaved.


4.4         The Government welcomed both reports as thorough and
constructive and has given every encouragement to those concerned
to implement their recommendations.        This part of the memorandum
concentrates on those       recommendations which bear on football
hooliganism.


4.5         In chapter 18 of his final report Lord Justice Taylor
set   out   his    conclusions   on     strategies    against   football
hooliganism.      In doing so he concluded that he could not support
the implementation of the national membership scheme proposed in


                                   14
the Football Spectators Act.                In view of his reservations the
Government has not implemented the scheme.


4.6          In putting forward strategies against hooliganism Lord
Justice Taylor reiterated the view, which is also that of the
Government, that there was no single measure which would defeat
football   hooliganism.           He    also felt        that     even   a package       of
measures     could       take    time       to    have     effect.         His     first
recommendation          was     for     all-seated         accommodation         to     be
progressively required at large capacity sports grounds.                          He saw
seating as doing more for safety and for problems of behaviour
and crowd control than any other single measure.


4.7          He    identified         closed     circuit    television      (GCTV)^^s
equipment which could be further developed to help detect^Pnd
provide evidence against hooligan behaviour.                        CCTV is already
widely used by the police in connection with football,                            as is
described in Part V.           Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations that
clubs should provide a police control room with equipment to the
satisfaction       of    the     appointed        liaison       officer    will        help
consolidate the position at League football grounds, all of which
have had CCTV facilities for some while.                        ACPO have recently
produced, in co-operation with the Home Office Police Scientific
Development Branch, guidance notes for the procurement of CCTV
for public safety at football grounds.                   Copies of the guide have
been sent to all Football League clubs and to local authorities
responsible       for safety certificates.               Costs of installing or
uprating CCTV equipment at all Football League grounds are being
met in full by the Football Trust.


4.8          Lord Justice Taylor also identified the potential of
the then newly-established NFIU as something to be developed.
The NFIU has not yet been                in operation for a full domestic
season.    Its aims and development are described in Part V.                           The
Government    will      continue       to   encourage       its    emergence      as    an
effective counter to serious and persistent football hooligans.



                                            15
4.9         Following publication of Lord Justice Taylor1s interim
report a copy was issued by the Home Office to all chief officers
of police in England and Wales (and local authorities, football
authorities      etc)        encouraging         them      to start         implementing          the
recommendations          which           touched      upon        their     responsibilities,
drawing particular attention to those which Lord Justice Taylor
said should be implemented before the 1989/90 season.


4.10        Much        of     the       effort       in     implementing              the    Taylor
recommendations,             whether       in the       interim or          final       report,    is
required at local level because many of the arrangements which
have to be made need to take account of local circumstances.
The Government has encouraged and supported this activity and
welcomes the positive and prompt response which the Association
of^^iief Police Officers has made to the recommendations.                                         The
Government regards it as important that all the efforts which
have been made so far should be sustained and will continue to
monitor the situation to ensure that they are.


4.11        As     to    the       recommendations                themselves,           ACPO     were
initially concerned that recommendation 4 in the interim report
would    lead    to contractual              agreements           between        the    police    and
football clubs which they felt unable to accept.                                 However, by the
time of the final report it had become clear that Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendation was meant simply to lead to a document
which set out clearly how functions were to be divided between
the local police and the club.                        He was content for this to be
achieved    by means          of     a    "statement         of    intent"       rather        than a
legally binding contract.


4.12        Recommendations                12,     16   and       20   were      concerned       with
ensuring that the split of responsibilities between stewards and
police     were         understood,              that        each         knew         what     their
responsibilities were, and that they had been properly trained
in those functions.                ACPO has put work in hand on identifying
training needs for police officers which will depend to some
extent on the degree of use to which stewards will be put.                                         An


                                                 16
increase in the use of stewards by the clubs would be a welcome
move in principle and would save on the police manpower required
at each game.        However,    stewards should be fit and able and
properly trained to carry out their tasks.            An ACPO working party
is developing a course for police ground commanders and is also
developing training packages for other ranks.                  ACPO are also
anxious to be involved in the training of club stewards.


4.13         On recommendations about police planning, numbers 44,
45, 46, 49, and 51 were carried over from the interim report and
we understand      that each of them has been acted upon by                     the
police.    Recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52 and 53 were new to the
final report.        The police will now take a tougher line in not
admitting ticketless fans to all-ticket matches (rec 47) and ACPO
are    reviewing     arrest   procedures   within       grounds      (rec         .
Consideration with       clubs of the possibility of re-schedu^Big
high-risk games (rec 50) presents no difficulty for the police.
ACPO is well-advanced in the preparation of a course for senior
officers (rec 52) which deals with all aspects of Lord Justice
Taylor's   report.       On   recommendation     53    the   Home    Office      is
consulting     the    football    authorities,        the    local       authority
associations and police representative bodies, on the terms of
a Home Office circular (referred to in paragraph 2.5) advising
police authorities to recover as far as is practicable the full
cost of providing police officers inside football grounds.


4.14         In response to the recommendations on communications
the Home Office made available from 1 January 1990 eight new
channels for use at pre-planned events which may be used for
command purposes at football matches.          Work is in hand to see how
the use of radios in a noisy environment can be improved.                       We
understand    that    the   recommendations    (nos     59-63)      on    the   co­
ordination of emergency services have been implemented.


4.15         Lord Justice Taylor also made recommendations (nos 70-
73 in his final report) on offences and penalties to help combat
unruly behaviour.


                                     17
4.16           The first of these (rec 70) would make selling tickets
for and on the day of a match without authority from the home
club to do so a criminal offence.                     Its purpose would be to
prevent       a club's   segregation policy being undermined and                        to
discourage ticketless fans from travelling and creating disorder
as     they    mill   around     outside       the   ground.          The   Government
recognises the force of the recommendation.                       It would wish to
rtffttrict any new touting offence to tickets for football matches
[and is giving the proposal detailed consideration].


4.17           The    second    (rec    71)    suggested        the    creation    of   3
specific offences at designated sports grounds: namely, throwing
a missile, chanting obscene or racialist abuse; and going on the
        without reasonable excuse.             The Government well understands
what    lies    behind    these      proposals       and    is    looking     at   them
sympathetically.               [An   announcement          of    the     Government's
conclusions is expected to be made shortly.]


4.18           The third (rec 72) suggested that consideration should
be given to extending the scope of attendance centre orders so
that they can be imposed on football related offenders aged 21
or over; and that their maximum length be increased from 36 to
72 hours.      After careful consideration the Government has reached
the conclusion that it would not be sensible to extend the use
of attendance centre orders in the way proposed.                         These orders
are not merely meant to offer a temporary restriction on liberty
but also to provide constructive activities designed to help
people make better use of their time.                      Older,      more difficult
offenders are unsuitable for the scheme and would be likely to
have a disruptive effect.              The number of centres would need to
be greatly increased to provide a nationwide service on Saturdays
when most centres are now open and having to open for mid-week
matches would provide further practical problems.


4*19          The Government, however, believes that the attendance
centre order has a role in dealing with young offenders and in


                                          18
the circular referred to in paragraph 3.29 above the courts were
reminded      of     the   powers         which   they    already         have    and    were
encouraged to consider linking attendance centre orders with
exclusion orders for suitable offenders.


4.20          The       fourth   (rec      73),   suggested        that    consideration
should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging)
in the sentencing of football related offenders.                          The Government
announced in its White Paper, Crime, Justice and Protecting the
Public (Cm 965),           it proposals to bring forward legislation to
allow the courts to make curfew orders as a penalty following
conviction which could               (subject to the outcome of electronic
monitoring trials) be enforced by monitoring.                       If the courts were
given curfew powers they would be able to apply them in cases of
football-related offences.


4.21          Some of the recommendations which were made by Lord
Justice Taylor had implications for the police not so much for
the purpose of dealing with hooligans but for ensuring safety.
The    two    concepts        are,     however,     linked     and        the     remaining
paragraphs describe how the recommendations on safety which apply
to the police have been taken up.


4.22          To     assist      the      local   authority        in   exercising         its
functions      in connection with the safety                  certificate           for the
ground    (issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act                                 1975)
recommendation 31 calls for the setting up of an advisory group
consisting         of    appropriate        members      of   its       own      staff    and
representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services and
the building authority.                This emphasises that the approach to
safety at the ground must be multi-disciplinary.


4.23          Recommendation 74 of Lord Justice Taylor's final report
concerned      the      "Green Guide",        the guide       to    safety        at sports
grounds      issued      jointly     by    the Home      Office     and     the    Scottish
Office.      In line with this recommendation the Home Office have
set up a working party to revise the Guide in accordance with


                                             19
Lord Justice Taylor's          findings.         It is anticipated that            the
revised guide will be available by the end of the year and that,
inter alia, it will assist the police in their task of policing
football grounds by clearly setting out the requirements on all
concerned    in    hosting     a match      to    maintain     crowd     safety    and
control.    Equally the guide is likely to emphasise the need for
the police, no less than the others concexned, to recognise that
the safety arrangements of the ground, which will be prescribed
in the safety certificate issued by the local authority,                           are
often a carefully balanced package and that proposals for changes
in the arrangements or procedures of the ground should normally
be pursued through the advisory group, and not unilaterally with
the club if safety is r>ot to be prejudiced.


4.^^        Lord     Justice     Taylor's    report      has     given   a   new   and
welcome    impetus    to   the    pursuit        of   improved    safety     and   the
reduction of hooliganism at football matches.                      The Government
believes it has demonstrated its commitment to those objectives

5 -    POLICE OPERATIONS (DOMESTIC GAMES)


5.1        As was indicated in part 2,                throughout the football
season    the    police    have   to    devote    considerable        resources         to
policing football matches.             Much of their effort is directed at
ensuring safe and orderly behaviour both on the way to and from
grounds and within grounds.


5.2      Over the recent years police               efforts against football
hooligans have been unremitting.


5.3        As     their     methods     developedthe       police     adopted       a
s ^ ^ t e g y of 'policing by containment'.           This involves escorting
segregated supporters to and from the ground,                      maintaining the
strict segregation of rival fans at the ground and using fencing
within the ground to control the movement of supporters.                      Strict
segregation can create an atmosphere of security for the well-
behaved supporter but the police are aware that it can also
accentuate rivalry and fuel aggression.               This view was echoed by
Lord   Justice     Taylor    in   his    Final    Report    when     he    said    that
hooliganism 'may even have been intensified by the segregation.'


5.4        'All     -ticket'      arrangements          for        matches   (ie        an
announcement that spectators will be admitted only with tickets
bought in advance, none being on sale on the day of the match)
support    the    physical    segregation        measures     at    the    ground       by
ensuring so far as possible that tickets are allocated to rival
supporters for admission to different parts of the ground.                          The
decision    to make       a match      'all-ticket'    is made        by   agreement
between the police and the club when the club expect the match
to be sold out or when the police expect the number of 'away*
supporters to be greater than their allocation of tickets.                              In
line with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation the clubs have
been urged by individual Ground Commanders to be scrupulous about
not making tickets available on the day of the match in such


                                         21
circumstances and the police service have resolved as a matter
of policy not to admit ticketless fans to the match.


5.5           Lord Justice Taylor observed (as was noted in paragraph
4.7)    above,       closed     circuit          television    (CCTV)     has    proved
particularly useful to the police.                  All 92 clubs in the Football
League and Wembley Stadium are now covered by fixed CCTV systems
or portable tripod mounted systems inside grounds or both.                        Money
for these has been provided by the Football Trust.                        Analysis of
film    by    intelligence          officers        after     matches     can    reveal
associations        between    hooligan          groups,    breaches    of    exclusion
orders, and criminal offences unrecognised at the time.                           Video
evidence can be crucial in securing convictions. For the past
four years an optical evidence intelligence gathering course has
been run by Greater Manchester Police on behalf of ACPO fo
benefit of all forces.


5.6           Most police forces have a liaison officer for football
who exchanges information with his counterparts in other forces
and with clubs in preparation for forthcoming fixtures.                            Some
forces also have an intelligence officer maintaining records on
known football hooligans in their area.                       Aware that there are
those   who       organise    and       orchestrate    soccer    violence       without
themselves becoming too closely involved in it, the police have
in recent years launched covert operations against the hooligan
ringleaders.         Police officers             infiltrate hooligan groups and
collect      evidence    over       a    long     period    before   mounting     major
operations simultaneously to arrest those against whom evidence
has been collected.


5.7           A    number     of        trials    following     covert       operations
collapsed following possible irregularities in police evidence.
The circumstances are currently under investigation under the
supervision of the Police Complaints Authority.                         More recently
a number of successful operations have been carried out by a
number of forces who imposed rigorous selection and intensive
training procedures on the covert teams, and worked in close co­


                                             22
operation with the Crown Prosecution Service from the outset.
These improvements in police undercover work have led to the
successful      prosecution      and   conviction      of   organised    hooligan
gangs.  Good intelligence and investigative methods have been
essential.


5.8            The National Football Intelligence Unit (NFIU) was set
up at the end of 1989.          Home Office Circular 30/1990, setting out
its terms of reference is annexed at G.                 The NFIU is a team of
seven police officers on central service.               Their work supplements
and complements that done by local forces.                  The NFIU's aims are
to:


       (i)     provide a centx~al point for the collation,               analysis
               and dissemination of intelligence, and for the better
               co-ordination of police operations,              in relation    to
               serious    and    persistent      football     hooligans/gangs,
               especially    those     who    travel   throughout   the    United
               Kingdom (including Scotland) or abroad;


      (ii)     promote effective collation of intelligence by local
               forces and ensure compatibility between systems used
               at local and national level.            Members of the Unit may
               be available to visit forces, on request, to assist in
               establishing intelligence operations and to advise on
               best practice;


       (iii)    provide     a channel    for    communication     with    foreign
               police forces for such intelligence and for traffic
               information      (in this capacity the head of the Unit
               acts as the UK's permanent correspondent on football
               to TREVI);


       (iv) assess the extent and nature of football hooliganism
               and its criminal associations nationally;




                                         23
       (v)   provide     technical      and    some     operational       support
             regarding    the    use    of    optical    evidence       gathering
             equipment,    the    analysis      of    video     tapes    and   the
             preparation and presentation of optical evidence before
             the courts.


5*9          The NFIU is funded as a common police service under
section 41 of the Police Act 1964.


5*10         It is too soon since the NFIU was established to judge
fully its effectiveness.           But is has already established good
working relations with local forces and has built up a valuable
store of intelligence.          It is expected that it will complement
existing police strategies             with a new emphasis on assisting
forces to target the most serious and persistent hooligansf^id
their ringleaders.       The NFIU also played and was seen to play an
important role in combatting hooliganism during the World Cup,
(described in section 7 below).


5.11         The police have recognised that wide co-operation is
important to deal effectively with football hooliganism.                        To
this end regular liaison and consultation arrangements have been
set up with the football authorities.                An important example of
this co-operation is the national consultation on the scheduling
of fixtures.    Following the disorder in Bournemouth on 5 May 1990
the Home Secretary sought and obtained an agreement from the
Football League that they would in future heed the advice of the
police with     regard    to    fixtures     with    a strong    potential     for
disorder.


5.12         Regular liaison arrangements have also been established
by the police at national level with the Football Supporters'
Association and the National Federation of Football Supporters'
Clubs,   the two organisations representing supporters,                  so that
their views can be taken into account when operational policy is
being formulated.



                                       24
6 -     POLICE OPERATIONS (INVOLVING FOREIGN TEAMS)



6.1           Football hooliganism involving teams from different
countries      can be         dealt     with    effectively        only    with        the    full
support      of   the      countries         concerned.        In     1987       the    UK     was
instrumental in setting up through the TREVI group of EC law
enforcement       ministers           and    officials,     a network        of       permanent
correspondents           to     exchange       information     relevant          to    policing
football in Europe.             Following the European Championships in West
Germany in 1988 guidelines on. the exchange of information were
drawn up by the UK and presented to TREVI in early 1989.                                    A copy
i s # t Annex H.          The role of the UK correspondent has recently
been taken on by the head of the National Football Intelligence
Unit.       The NFIU now acts as the channel of communication with
foreign forces exchanging information about numbers of football
supporters expected to travel, routes, dates of travel etc.


6.2           Apart from its TREVI role the NFIU has an important
international            dimension      and     has   already       established             useful
policing      links       abroad       for     the    planning      of    operations           for
international fixtures.                The NFIU provided officers in Italy for
the World Cup operation to assist the Italian police during the
tournament with advice and intelligence as required.


6.3           The UK is also a founding signatory of the Council of
Europe Convention on Spectator Violence at Sporting Events, whose
official standing committee was chaired until July 1990 by the
Department of the Environment.                   (The Chairmanship has now passed
to    the   Dutch.)           The    Convention       encourages      parties          to    adopt
policies      and    practical          measures      to    counter       hooliganism          and
promote      the safety of spectators.                     Among    the measures             since
recommended         by    the       standing    committee      are       those    concerning
policing and related security arrangements at high-risk matches.



                                                25
6.4          Early planning for matches is required to ensure that
precautions are taken to diminish crowd disturbances.                      By the
UK's efforts in TREVI host countries have been urged to adopt
similar precautions to those found effective in our experience,
most importantly the control of ticket sales and segregation.



6.5          Since the European Championships in West Germany in
1988 it is becoming established practice, for all international
matches with a high risk of disorder, for a few police officers
to be provided to travel to the host country as "spotters".                   The
role of    "spotters"     is to interpret        the behaviour of England
supporters    for   the   benefit     of   the    local   police    and,    where
possible, to identify known troublemakers.                In the case of club
games this will normally involve officers from the local f^fcce
familiar with the regular "troublemakers" from the club; for the
national   teams    officers   from    the NFIU may        attend    and where
necessary be equipped with their transportable computer terminal
to provide information instantly.                Travel and overtime costs
incurred to date at internationals have broadly been met by the
Football Association on a basis similar to that on which "special
services" by the police are charged to local clubs.


6.6          Following UEFA's decision to allow Aston Villa and
Manchester United back into European competition this season,
the Department of Environment has established a working party
to consider safety and security arrangements.               The working party
is chaired by the DoE and includes representatives from the Home
Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the police, the Football
Association and the two football clubs.               Similar arrangements
will be established for the European Championships in 1992.


6.7          The FA and the clubs, taking account of police advice,
are categorising each match involving either of the two English
clubs playing in European competitions by the degree of risk,
thereby identifying the high-risk games.              When live television
coverage is not planned the FA and the clubs have agreed that


                                      26
where   possible     attractive     facilities        should       be   laid   on    for
viewing the matches in this country.                 Their purpose would be to
encourage supporters to watch the games here rather than travel
to away matches abroad.       For those supporters who want to attend
the away legs for the less sensitive games, the clubs are being
encouraged to provide tickets as part of a travel package through
well-organised travel club membership schemes so as to ensure
supporters good behaviour and to marginalise hooligan elements.
For the high-risk games the clubs will consider not taking up any
ticket allocations.


6.8         Before    the    away    legs       an    FA    official      will      make
exploratory visits to the foreign football authorities and clubs
and venues.    He will be accompanied by the home club secretary,
pd(^ibly the police ground commander or his nominee and, where
appropriate,    Consular      officials.              It    is     desirable        that
responsible British police officers should be able to make early
contact with their counterparts abroad so that both sides can
draw up operational plans with the benefit of advice from their
opposite numbers.         Where it is thought by the police on both
sides to be operationally desirable, it is expected that police
liaison officers will travel to away locations to advise the
local police on the identity and tactics of hooligans (and other
matters).      Reciprocal arrangements where appropriate would be
welcomed by British police.


6.9         As with internationals the Government will expect the
football    clubs    or   authorities      to    meet      extra    policing     costs
incurred.




                                      27
7 - WORLD CUP 1990



7.1         Experience       of     the    European        Championships       in    West
Germany in 1988 proved the value of early preparation for major
international tournaments.                Accordingly,       the Department of the
Environment set up a World Cup Working Group which met regularly
between     June    1989    and    the     finals    and    became    the     forum    for
government officials (DOE, HO, FCO), the police and the football
authorities        to     co-ordinate        the     UK     safety     and     security
arrangements        for     the     tournament.             Apart     from     policing
arrangements       the group addressed the issues of ticket sales,
travel    routes,         ground     security       and      segregation,          alcohol
r^^rictions and information and advice to supporters.


7.2         In November 1989 the Home Office made initial contact
with the Italian authorities by hosting a policing conference in
London attended by senior Italian police officers and officials.
This    early    meeting     laid    the    foundation        for    future    policing
cooperation       and    a number     of    further        useful    exchange       visits
followed.       The UK welcomed a group of 50 Carabinieri officers for
two weeks in March 1990 who came to improve their English and
general understanding of English culture,                      legal and policing
systems and to see at first hand how the policing of football
matches is undertaken in the UK.                   The officers spent some time
at    the police college           at Bramshill       before being deployed in
groups of 5 to 10 different police force areas for practical
experience.        Following the success of this visit a group of 16
senior    police        officers     (of    the     equivalent       rank     to    Chief
Constable) from various regions of Italy spent a weekend with the
Greater Manchester Police in early May.                    They came to learn more
aboul police arrangements             for football matches by talking to
their English       counterparts          and by visiting           a First Division
match.




                                            28
7*3          Home Office officials,              together with senior British
police officers,          attended planning conferences hosted by                   the
British Embassy in Rome in January and March 1990.                         The police
officers     made       reconnaissance      visits    to    Sardinia       and    other
possible venues for the England team, establishing contact with
the local        chiefs of police and administrators.                    These    early
reconnaissance trips proved their worth during the tournament
when effective cooperation was achieved in terms of liaison on
the ground based on the provision of the necessary communication
and office facilities.


7*4          A British police liaison team was formed, headed by
Assistant        Chief    Constable       Malcolm     George      of     the    Greater
Manchester Police, and including some officers of the National
Football     Intelligence Unit.            The    team went       to    Italy at^^he
request     of    the    Italian authorities         to assist         in identifying
troublemakers       and    to    offer    advice     as    required      in    handling
supporters generally.             A transportable version of the NFIU's
computer     was    useful       in   providing     text    and    photographs       on
suspected or convicted hooligans.


7*5          In order to strengthen the arrangements for World Cup
security, the Home Secretary forwarded to the Italian Minister
of    the   Interior       the    names    of    certain     convicted         football
hooligans, with his recommendation that the Italian authorities
consider excluding them from the country during the World Cup.
The persons concerned were warned in writing by the Home Office
of the action taken.             Interested transit countries were also
advised of the recommendations.                  It may not be necessary             to
consider a similar exercise in future once the restriction order
provisions of the Football Spectators Act 1989 have been more
widely established by further bilateral agreements with other
countries.


7.6          At each match location in Italy as well as the police
liaison team a full British consular team was mustered by FCO.
DoE and Home Office also provided press officers in Italy.                         The


                                          29
local consular teams were in direct contact with the consular
communications room in London so that officials here were able
to keep abreast of affairs.


7.7           The FA Travel Club was set up for England supporters
wishing to travel abroad to watch the team play.                       The FA checked
all applicants for membership against their own 'black list' of
troublemakers       and    required      applicants      to provide          details     of
accommodation and travel plans.             These arrangements helped ensure
that tickets were not sold to known troublemakers, assisted in
the policing of the main travel routes and with the segregation
of rival groups of supporters in the stadia.


7.8           To deter potential football hooligans from misbehaving
tl^^UK Government and police gave advance publicity to various
measures taken.        This included publicity for the list of those
to be considered for exclusion from Italy, for the close scrutiny
of football supporters leaving England for Italy,                            and for the
'hooligan hot-line1 operated by the NFIU - a special telephone
number for members of the public to volunteer information on
suspected football hooliganism.


7.9           Before and during the tournament Home Office Ministers
and the Minister for Sport, travelled to Italy to reinforce these
messages,      to   see        for    themselves     how    the      police        liaison
arrangements were working and to thank the Italian authorities
for their co-operation.


7.10          The   British          Transport     Police       mounted       a    special
operation     to    monitor      supporters      travelling        out       of   the   UK,
designating certain trains from the North of England to London,
and    from   London      to    the   Channel    ports     as    'd r y ',   and    making
contingency arrangements to divert ferries back to the UK if
football supporters should become disorderly.


7.11          Complementing these policing arrangements and building
upon the work of the inter-departmental working group referred


                                           30
to above,    there was a series of discussions both before and
during the tournament between the Minister for Sport and the
Italian     authorities.       They        responded    positively     to   his
suggestions which included alcohol restrictions outside as well
as inside the ground, segregating rival groups of supporters on
the ferries to Sardinia, at the Italian airports and on the way
to the matches as well as in the stadia, and prosecuting football
hooligans who broke the law.


7.12        In general the England supporters1 attendance at the
World Cup tournament passed off comparatively peacefully.                   The
police liaison team were able to provide important information
and intelligence which helped the Italian police to deploy their
resources positively and effectively, anticipating incidents or
preventing them from developing.


7.13        There were only two major incidents of note involving
England supporters.        The first occurred in Cagliari on 16 June
immediately before the England v Netherlands match when a large
number of England supporters were attempting to march in a large
body to the match.      The Italian police reacted swiftly and firmly
and the situation was quickly defused.                 The match itself was
played without    incident.      The other major          incident    involved
England supporters in the seaside resort of Rimini,                   where no
alcohol ban had been imposed on 25 June,                two days before the
England v Belgium match was due to be played in nearby Bologna.
Sporadic fighting broke out in seafront bars and some 270 English
were detained by the Italian police.           Of those detained, 238 were
returned from Italy to London.


7.14        We are studying the World Cup experience both at home
with the British police officers concerned and in the TREVI forum
with our European counterparts.              The lessons learned will be
incorporated     into    our   policing       policy     for    the   European
Championships    in   Sweden   1992   and other        future   international
matches.

8 -    PRESS COVERAGE



8.1          The    Home        Office       has     not    attempted         any    systematic
assessment of press coverage of football related violence.


8.2          It    has     been        argued      that      press      coverage,       through
attempts to predict likely confrontations, may have increased the
violent behaviour of football hooligans.                          This would be difficult
to establish beyond doubt but the argument seems plausible.                                    The
mere   presence      of     cameras,          particularly           at    events       like   the
European Cup and the World Cup,                        and the contingents of news
reporters apparently unconcerned with the game itself, may have
       effect       of     encouraging             acts      of      hooligan         behaviour.
Nevertheless there is a legitimate public interest in football
hooliganism meriting press coverage.


8.3          However,           it    does     appear        that    on    occasions       press
coverage     of    football          related       disorder       has     been      exaggerated,
particularly when British fans have been abroad.                                    For example,
during the European Cup in 1988 and again in connection with the
Sweden v England match in June 1989, the foreign press and police
seem to have perceived the disorderliness of the English fans as
much less serious than was reported by the English press.                                 It was
a welcome change as England progressed in the World Cup 1990 when
the football itself became the topic considered most newsworthy.


8.4          Also    during           the    World     Cup    1990      the     press    carried
reports about the cooperation between the Italian and the British
authorities to curb the hooligan behaviour of British fans.                                    It
is not possible to say with certainty what the effect of those
reports was but they xaay have assisted in deterring bad behaviour
and    may   have        been        particularly          effective       in       discouraging
troublesome fans from going to Sardinia, where the England team
played its group matches.



                                                32
9 -    CONCLUSION



9*1           There is no single simple cure for the ills of football
hooliganism.         In the absence of such a cure policing has to be
directed      to     prevention,        containment        anddealing       with        the
consequences of the behaviour.               For its part, the Government has
introduced        legislation     with     the     intention      of   preventing and
punishing      hooligan behaviour           specific       to      football. In1985
legislative controls were tightened on alcohol in connection with
football; in 1986 the courts were giv<=m power to make exclusion
oi^ters;      and    in   1989   the courts were           given power to           impose
r ^ P riction orders.          The Government is considering the creation
of further offences to curb disorderly behaviour at football
matches as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor.


9.2           The     police     have     become    increasingly        effective        in
dealing      with    football     hooliganism.            The    development of         the
National Football           Intelligence Unit         and of      the use of close
circuit television are assisting the police considerably.


9.3        However,      the police cannot be expected to shoulder the
burden alone.        The football authorities also have a crucial role
to    play   in     improving    the      facilities       for    spectators and         in
influencing         their     behaviour.           Local    measures        to    control
hooliganism require the close co-operation of the police and the
clubs acting with proper regard for the safety of the public.
For   example,      as    stewarding      becomes more          effective    so police
manpower inside the ground can be reduced without prejudice to
public safety and with benefit to the public purse.


9.4           The     World    Cup   in    Italy     in    1990    showed        that   co­
ordination and advance planning by the Governments and the police
forces concerned can go a long way to reduce the opportunities
for football hooliganism.            Acceptance of English clubs back into


                                            33
European club football will entail similar, though smaller scale,
cooperation in both directions.     The Government, the police, the
football authorities, and the clubs have a common interest in
keeping hooligan behaviour by British fans out of Europe.


9*5       Recent statistics show that recorded offences in and
around football grounds have declined over the past two seasons.
In the longer term, the Government sees the implementation of
Lord   Justice   Taylor's   proposals,     including   the   phased
introduction of all-seater stadia, as offering the best prospect
for reducing football hooliganism to the extent that it is no
more of a problem than at any other event which attracts large
crowds.

SUMMARY OF HOME OFFICE MEMORANDUM WRITTEN EVIDENCE



1.          The memorandum notes that the mischief of football
hooliganism,      which has existed for over 100 years in various
forms, has no one simple cause or remedy.                   It draws briefly on
the reports of Mr Justice Popplewell and Lord Justice Taylor and
their analyses of football hooligans.


2.          In Part 2 the memorandum briefly indicates the amount
of League football which is played in England and Wales,                         the
resources       devoted    to    policing      it   and   the   levels   of   crime
associated with it over recent seasons.                     The main points       to
emerge    are    that     5000   police     officers      may   be   committed    to
football-related duties on a typical Saturday during the season;
that much of their effort is directed at maintaining safety, a
factor which is inter-dependent with the maintenance of public
order; and that the available statistics give ground for cautious
optimism in that there has been a reduction in the number of
arrests at grounds in recent years despite a trend of increasing
attendance.


3.          Part 3 lists the relevant legislation which bears on
football hooliganism.            Some of the legislation, such as Part IV
of the Public Order Act 1986, the Sporting Events                     (Control of
Alcohol   etc)     Act    1985 and the Football Spectators               Act 1989
contains provisions specific to football, while other provisions
have general application.


4.          Exclusion orders, which were established in Part IV
of the Public Order Act I986, remain in place.                   It is an offence
for anyone subject to an exclusion order to attend an association
football match in England and Wales.                The Football Spectators Act
1989 provided for the making of restriction orders by the courts
to prevent people convicted of football-related offences (whether


                                          35
here or abroad) attending designated matches outside England and
Wales.    The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985,
as amended, imposed controls on the consumption and carriage of
alcohol both at designated matches and on the way to and from
them by road or rail.            It also made it an offence to carry
bottle, cans, and fireworks etc at designated games.


5.         Part 4 of the memorandum considers the implications
for policing      football     hooliganism of Lord              Justice Taylor's
reports into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.                  The main thrust
of the reports has been to re-emphasise to all those concerned
with football, including the police, the primacy to be given to
the   safety   of    spectators.      Hooliganism        can    itself    threaten
safety.


6.         The police have moved quickly,              with encouragement from
the   Government,     to     implement    those      recommendations      of    Lord
Justice   Taylor     which    are   relevant      to    them.     Of    particular
importance has been the establishment of procedures to ensure
that the police and stewards at matches know exactly what their
respective responsibilities are.


7.         Apart from his recommendation               about all-seated stadia
and safety matters, Lord Justice Taylor recommended combatting
hooliganism by developing the potential of video evidence and the
recently established National Football Intelligence Unit.                       Lord
Justice   Taylor      also    recommended      the     creation    of    some    new
offences. These proposals are being considered by the Government
[but final decisions have yet to be made].


8.         Part     5 looks    in broad terms          at the development of
strategies for policing domestic football matches in England and
Wales.    It highlights developing the efficacy of video evidence
gathering and the role of the National Football Intelligence Unit
(NFIU).




                                         36
9.         Part 6 looks in broad terms at the police approach to
games which involve teams from England or Wales playing abroad
and games which involve foreign teams coming to this country.


10.        Part 6 also looks at the plans which are being laid
for the return of English clubs to European competition next
season and further forward to the European championships to be
held in Sweden in 1992.      The facilities which clubs provide for
the   supporters    who   travel   abroad    are   expected   to   play   an
important part in influencing the behaviour of visiting fans.


11.        Part 7 of the memorandum describes the work carried
out for the World Cup competition in Italy this year.                Early
contact between Home Office officials and the British police and
t^j^r Italian counterparts proved to be invaluable.


12.        During the competition itself a police liaison team
was present in Italy.        The team was assisted by Foreign and
Commonwealth Office staff.         A public hotline to the NFIU in
London was set up to enable information to be given in confidence
on hooligans.      The NFIU officers had available to them in Italy
their transportable computer with text and photographs.             A list
of convicted hooligans who, it was thought, could cause trouble
was sent to the Italian authorities with the recommendation that
consideration should be given to their exclusion.         This procedure
was adopted in the knowledge that the restriction order procedure
could not be applied to those convicted before April 1990.


13.        In Part 8 the memorandum touches on press coverage of
football hooliganism.      Press coverage may affect the behaviour
of football hooligans.       Media reports can exaggerate levels of
hooliganism.       On the other hand,       by giving publicity     to the
preparations the Italian and the British authorities made for the
World Cup 1990, the media may have reduced hooligan behaviour.


14.        In Part 9 the memorandum concludes that policing effort
will continue to be required to prevent, contain and deal with


                                    37
the consequences of football hooliganism.          The powers available
to the courts have been significantly extended in recent years
and the Government is considering further extending them in line
with Lord Justice Taylor's          recommendations;     the police are
increasingly effective in preventing and dealing with football
hooliganism;   and   the   police    effort will   be   enhanced    as   the
influence of the National Football Intelligence Unit grows.


“15.       Increasing importance is attached to international co­
operation in the policing of international and club games played
abroad.   Experience gained in connection with the World Cup 1990
points the way ahead for the policing of travelling supporters
now that English      clubs   are     being   re-admitted   to     European
competition.


16.        Finally there are signs that football hooliganis^^n
and immediately around grounds has been contained and is starting
to decline.    In    the longer      term the   implementation of Lord
Justice Taylor's recommendations should further reduce the level
of hooliganism at football.
