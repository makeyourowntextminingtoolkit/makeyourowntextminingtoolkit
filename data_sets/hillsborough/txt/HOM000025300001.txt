        Dear Sir,

        Re:   The Taylor Inquiry

        I enclose the report of the Medics at       Hillsborough Working Party        for
        consideration by the Inquiry.

        This report is the result of work done by a group of doctors,        and other
        health workers who were present at Hillsborough on April 15th        1989 and
        who became   involved in the emergency operation.     We have        tried to
        examine    the   events  dispassionately    and   to   make          practical
        recommendations for inclusion  in the final   Inquiry report.        We trust
        that this report will recieve serious consideration.

        Yours faithfully,




         Dr John Ashton
         On behalf of the Medics at Hillsborough Working Party
                                 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

REPORT OF THE MEDICS AT HILLSBOROUGH WORKING PARTY (MAHWP)                                    ON     THE
FUTURE PROVISION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

Background

We are a group of doctors, nurses and a medical student who all became

involved with       the    emergency     response        at       Hillsborough       on April      15th

1989.     Some of us were at Hillsborough as football supporters and were

standing either      on the      terraces         or   in the       stands when       the   disaster

occurred.       Others were among those who responded to media requests for

assistance at the ground and turned out to help.




In our opinion the interim report of the disaster inquiry (Cm765) is a

paradox with respect to the emergency aspects.                              On the one hand the

report found that 'no valid criticism can be made of the response by

the St John's Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS (South Yorkshire Metropolitan

Ambulance Service) or by the fire brigade on April 15th....'                                (para 296

p 53).     On    the other hand the report makes 4 recommendations on the

co-ordination of emergency services,                    5 recommendations            on first aid,

medical     facilities     and    ambulances           and    importantly       in    our    view,     4

recommendations on communications .                    (Appendix 1)




It seems clear from the inquiry report that the overall responsibility

for coordinating the services responsible for ensuring public safety,

including the emergency services, rested, and at present rests with the

police    force.     Setting     aside      the    attribution            of blame    for   specific

failures     on    April     15th,     it    seemed          to     the     working    party       that

constructive recommendations could be made concerning the organisation

and staffing,      training and equipping of on-site emergency services at


                                                  1
football    matches       and   similar    events       and    the    lines     of    management,

co-ordination and communication between different professional                                  groups

providing those services.           The MAHWP working party confined itself to a

consideration of on-site           emergency services           and wishes           to propose      a

system designed to cope with normal medical                         emergencies       at    sporting

events (ie individual or small numbers of casualties/emergencies).                                  It

is our     view    that   at    present   even       that   eventuality        is not       properly

catered for and that members of the public,                    as distinct from club and

board    members    and    players    cannot         depend    on    an   adequate         emergency

response.     A first step to ensuring an adequate emergency response in

the event of a disaster is to have an effective system with clearly

defined responsibilities           in place          to cope   with more        likely       smaller

scale problems.




It is our view that it is unrealistic to equip and staff every sporting

stadium with sufficient resources to cope with another Hillsborough and

that the main emphasis should be on ensuring that another Hillsborough

cannot happen.       It is to be hoped that the main recommendations of the

Inquiry and their implementation will ensure that that is the case.




It   is however,      important      to   give       consideration        as   to    how    a    local

domestic    emergency response might be                coordinated with             a large      scale

disaster response         and what mechanisms need to be                  in place         to ensure

that all members of the emergency services, both ground-based and those

who are part of the district disaster plan know exactly what to do and

what the lines of communication, command and responsibility should be

in the event of another disaster.




                                                 2
It     is     our   opinion       that        lack   of     understanding          of   these       matters

contributed         to    the   chaotic        situation between              3.00pm    and       4.00pm    at

Hillsborough on April 15th 1989.                     In our opinion that chaotic situation

was not necessary and has led to at least one erroneous conclusion in

the interim report - namely that 'to attempt to use a defibrillator on

the pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous

owing to the risk of injury from the electric charge'.                                  In our opinion

had    everybody         from   the   emergency            services      who    were    involved       known

exactly what they had to do, a casualty clearing area would have been

established         and    secured       on    the   pitch        in    addition       to    that    in     the

gymnasium.          It     would      then      have       been    possible        to       have     used     a

defibrillator safely and to have drawn on the skills of more of the 33

South Yorkshire paramedics who were available                                 for disasters         than the

few who were actually used.




Similarly it is clear from the evidence given to the inquiry that a

third casualty            clearing station           should have             been established behind

Leppings Lane goal as part of a preformulated plan,                                that there was no

such        plan    and    that    no         casualty       clearing         station       was     formally

established.         These points all refer to a fundamental weakness in the

arrangements for an emergency plan for the ground.




Recommendations

1.      Organisation and staffing

        It is our view          that the interim report of the Taylor Committee

        provides a good starting point for ensuring an adequate first aid

        and    emergency        response        at   football          and    similar       grounds.        The




                                                       3
report recognises the inadequacy of depending on a club doctor who

may not have experience of mass casualty work as the mainstay of

the on-site response.               However,      we feel that the recommendations

in the interim report do not go far enough in two respects:

a)   It seems to us that the most appropriate medical input is to

     be   found       in     the     District       General        Hospital    accident      and

     emergency department and that negotiations should take place

     in each district for the consultant casualty surgeon to take

     on   the    responsibility          for providing              cover    for    appropriate

     public events.            Normally this responsibility would be met by

     making      available           junior        casualty         staff     and     operating

     department        assistants        to work        closely       with    the    paramedics

     from the ambulance service in operating a rota for adequate

     match day cover.               The responsibility for financing this cover

     should be with the football club.

b)   In order         to    ensure     that proper        arrangements         are    made   for

     emergency cover it should be the responsibility of football

     clubs      and        allied     organisations           to    convene    an     emergency

     committee consisting of:

                           a casualty consultant
                           chief ambulance officer
                           county surgeon of St John's Ambulance
                           Chief Fire Officer
                           Chief Constable
                           Borough Engineer

     who should collectively advise on the arrangements to be                                 in

     place.       The        responsibilities           for        funding    the     necessary

     arrangements           should     lie       with   the    football       club    or   other

     organisation arranging the event.




                                             4
           The        responsibilities        for ensuring an       adequate   emergency

           response should lie clearly               with the members of the committee

           and the arrangements proposed should be                  enforceable by law

           via a strengthening of the Safety Certificate mechanism.




With regard to      the medical emergency responseitself it should be the

responsibility of      the     consultant         casualty      surgeon        to      make

recommendations     for   staffing,    training        and equipment      to provide      the

necessary emergency service.           The    involvement of more highly            trained

health workers    in a duty rota would be anticipated to free St John's

Ambulance staff to concentrate on the less serious emergencies.




An emergency plan for minor emergencies                 for which    the on-site      staff

might expect to be self-sufficient and for major emergencies where the

on-site staff would need to fall in and work closely with the district

emergency plan should be formulated and be a statutory requirement for

the issue of a safety certificate.




The   co-ordination    of    these   two     plans    should be     facilitated by        the

casualty   consultant,       chief   ambulance       officer,   county    surgeon    of    St

John's Ambulance, Chief Fire Officer and Chief Constable being members

of both emergency plan teams.




Training and Equipment

The on-site emergency plan should provide the basis for a programme of

training to involve all those employed on the staff of football clubs

and similar organisations so that they all know what to do in the case




                                              5
of both     containable         emergencies      and    full-scale      disasters.       Training

should also take account of the need for certain key staff eg stewards

to be trained in basic first-aid.




The interim report of the Taylor Inquiry makes certain proposals about

the   first   aid       facilities      and   equipment       which    should be      present    at

football grounds.          We would wish to commend to the inquiry the circular

from Dr E B Lewis, Surgeon in Chief of the St John's Ambulance, London

dated   9th   June       1989   which    lists    the    recommended         first   aid medical

arrangements       at    football    grounds      in    the    light    of    the    Hillsborough

disaster.     We note particularly the                 inclusion in that circular of a

list of equipment which is only to be used by appropriately trained and

designated personnel (oxygen and Entonox) and a list of equipment which

is only to be used by registered medical practitioners familiar with

their use     (advanced monitoring ECG,                BP and pulse oximeters,           advanced

treatment     drips       and    sets     and    defibrillators         (appendix      2).      The

equipment     to be contained in each medical rooms would ultimately be

decided and regularly checked by the responsible casualty consultant.




Lines of managements, co-ordination and communication

The     football        club     emergency       committee       should        be     responsible

individually and collectively for                 the arrangements           for a containable

on-site emergency and for ensuring adequate linking in to the district

disaster plan response            in the      event of a non-containable               emergency.

The responsibilities are as follows:




                                                 6
The   football club   to convene       regular meetings      of the   emergency

committee prior to the start of each football season and at its

conclusion and at any time in between at the request of a member

of the emergency committee.




The casualty consultant should:

ensure that an adequate emergency rota is provided to a level as

agreed    with the    emergency committee       in   order    to   satisfy   the

requirements for the Safety Certificate and the emergency plan;




ensure that a rolling programme of staff training is developed in

keeping with the agreed emergency plan.




ensure     that adequate   and effective       equipment      is provided     in

keeping with the agreed emergency plan.




The County Surgeon of St John 's Ambulance should:

ensure that an adequate emergency rota is provided as agreed with

the requirements of the Safety Certificate and the emergency plan;




ensure that a rolling programme of staff training is developed in

keeping with the agreed emergency plan.




ensure     that adequate   and effective       equipment      is provided     in

keeping with the agreed emergency plan.




                                   7
      The responsible casualty consultant and the County Surgeon of St

      John's    Ambulance      should   be       responsible    for    co-ordinating    the

      medical and first-aid responses and ensuring full understanding of

      each others roles.




4.    The Chief Fire Officer should:

      ensure that the Fire Service response is fully co-ordinated with

      that of the other emergency services and that staff training is

      developed in keeping with the agreed emergency plan.




5.    The Chief Constable should:

      ensure    that   the emergency services           are   able    to carry out    their

      tasks in an orderly,       effective and efficient way in keeping with

      the agreed emergency plan and that appropriate staff training is

      developed.




6.    The Borough Engineer should:

      ensure   that statutory requirements for crowd safety and for                     the

      issue of a Safety Certificate are insisted on and met and that no

      public event        takes place without these           requirements having been

      met.




It   should    be   the    responsibility        of   all   members    of   the   emergency

committee to ensure that good communication between them is maintained

at all times both on and off match days.




                                             8
The     interim       report          of    the    Taylor       Inquiry          makes      4    recommendations              about

communication             in     more       general       sense.       We     believe           these     to    be     of     great

importance          in     preventing           another        Hillsborough.                However,       we     would       wish

to     point        out    the        importance          of    good        communications              between       emergency

agencies        as        well        as    within        them.        In        our     opinion         the     failure           of

inter-agency communication contributed to the chaos on April 15th 1989.



Conclusion

In     our    opinion,           the       medical      facilities          at     football           grounds        in     the    UK

are    amateurish.              A     system       such        as described         above        would     professionalise

the    arrangements             and bring            them up to        the standard              which     the       public       has

a     right     to        expect.           Part     of     the      weakness          in       the    present        situation

appears        to    be        the     extent      to     which      what        are     essentially             quasi-public

organisations              ie        football             clubs falls         outside             public         jurisdiction

because       they        are    privately              owned. If      an     acceptable              standard       of     public

safety        and     emergency              provision          is     to     be       attained          for     all        stadia

nationwide          then        any     recommendations              from     the       Taylor         Inquiry       should       be

made     a      statutory              requirement             enforceable             by       law     via      the        Safety

Certificate mechanism.

    Appendix 1.   Recommendations of the Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

    Interim Report




    Coordination of emergency services

         The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through

         senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning crowd safety

         at each stadium.

         Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should

         ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full

         details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the

         number of spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and

         exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the

         control or movement of the crowd.     Such details should be readily

         available in the control rooms of each of the emergency services.

         Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of

         emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.

         They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and

         accessibility within the ground itself.

         Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be

        briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of emergency

         services and should be informed when such services are called as

         to where and why they are required.




    First aid, medical facilities and ambulances

        There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained

         first aider per 1,000 spectators. The club should have the

         responsibility for securing such attendance.




                                         10
    There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms.          The

    number of such rooms and the equipment to be maintained within

     them should be specified by the local authority after taking

    professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of

     any Safety Certificate.

    The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at

     each match and available to deal with any medical exigency at the

     ground.     He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid.

    He should be present at the ground at least an hour before

    kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the

    match.     His whereabouts should be known to those in the police

     control room and he should be immediately contactable.

    At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate

     ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches with an

     expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

    The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where

     larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local

     authority after consultation with the ambulance services and

     should be made a requirement of the Safety Certificate.




Communications

     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to

     enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated and

     answered.     The radio system should be such as to give operators in

     the control rooms priority over, and the capacity or override,

     others using the same channel.       Additional channels should be

    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.




                                     11
Consideration should be given to sound-proofing the control rooms

against excessive crown noise.

To complement radio communications, there should be a completely

separate system of land lines with telephone links between the

control room and key points at the ground.

Within the control room, there should be a public address system

to communicate with individual areas outside and inside the ground

with groups of areas or with the whole ground.     Important

announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the

attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the

ground.   This arrangement should be prominently advertised on

every programme sold for every match.

Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising

boards to address the crowd.     Consideration should also be given

to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to

indicate to the control room the existence of certain emergencies

or requirements.
