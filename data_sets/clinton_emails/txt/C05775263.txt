I just want to drop you a note congratulating you on the vote tonight on health care, that whatever its imperfections the
establishment of the principle is a vindication. You might take a moment of personal privilege tomorrow to express
gratitude to Nancy Pelosi, the House, and the President for finally achieving the work of years. Sid
